    "text": "FLUTE HAND POSITION\nRIGHT HAND POSITION\nAllow the flute to lie back against the left shoulder.  The left hand makes a loose fist around the open area at the barrel of the flute.\nPlace the fingers first by touching the last three keys on the body of the flute with the index, middle and ring finger.\nThe fleshy finger pad (pudgy part of your finger) should touch the pads/plugs.\nShape the hand like a “C” (“flat-C” or “U” on its side).  The fleshy part should be in the center of the keys.  Most flutes have circles on the keys.  These circles can be used as guidelines for finger placement.\nPut the pinky down next--on its side, not the fleshy part--and face towards the end of the E-flat key by using the outside of the pinky.  The pinky should be curved like a question mark or a hook.  When this is correct, then have students perform the “V” exercise.\nPlace the thumb.  Have students gently pinch a table or music stand, and then relate that to the flute.  The thumb is placed somewhere between the first and second finger, where it is most natural.  The thumb needs to go on its side.  The thumb and pinky are connected by tendons.  If there is tension in one, there will be tension in the other.  Raise the big knuckles up.  They should be approximately level with the keys.  Continuously watch for “hitchhiker” thumbs.\nThe thumb and first finger of the right hand should point in the same direction.  Continually and closely watch out for “hitchhiker” thumbs, which result in the left hand fingers shifting in the wrong direction.\nThe right hand should never shift towards the lever Bb key; rather, it should be shifted towards the Eb key.  The only time the right hand index finger will ever have contact with the lever Bb key is when that fingering is actually being used.\nWhen the flute is lifted, move the arms from the elbows.  The shoulders are not engaged, and the elbows remain in the natural position in relation to the shoulders.\nThe wrist is either straight or slightly arched, but never bent toward the body of the flute.\nThe part between the thumb and first finger should be soft and open.  They should never touch.\nThe middle finger will have more height/bend to it because it is a longer finger, but it cannot hang over the edge.  The fingers have a slight curve, but the tips of the fingers are flat.\nThe right hand goes towards the flute, and should be parallel to the flute.\nThe fingers of the right hand should float or hover over the keys at all times.  Students should “push” down the keys only when appropriate for the fingerings.  Be sure the palm of the hand is soft so no tension is felt or seen.\nLEFT HAND POSTION\nWith the flute in its upright position on the left knee and supported by the right hand already in its correct position, the left hand makes a light fist at the barrel while the fingers are being placed.\nPlace the first finger on the second key—the skip one key and place the second and third fingers on the next two keys.\nThe pinky is placed on the G#/Ab key, and is curved and never leaves this “home position.”  Watch for pinkies that disappear either under the flute or under the G#/Ab key itself.\nThe thumb is between 12:00 and 1:00 on the “thumb Bb” key.  The thumb forms a “T” with the body of the flute.\nThe palm is close to the body of the flute under the index finger.  The index finger should touch the body of the flute and not look angular as the pad of the finger touches the key.  The back of the left hand should be perpendicular to the flute.  There is a slight “break” in its shape.  This can be achieved by rocking the left hand towards your body.\nThe fingers of the left hand should float or hover over the keys at all times.  Students should “push” down the keys only when appropriate for the fingerings.  Be sure the palm of the hand is soft so no tension is felt or seen.\nThe big knuckle will go somewhere between the first and second physical keys.\nThe fingers move from the big knuckles except for the index finger, which moves from the second joint.\nThe tip of the thumb and the base of the thumb should be on the same side of the flute.\nAs students get older and more advanced, the focus for finger movement is shifted from the big knuckles to where the finger tendons are attached to the wrist.\nBe patient with progress towards absolute hand position.  It is best to have “double jointed” students not play the flute.\nTo teach independent finger motion, put the fingers on every key and lift each singly.  Be sure all fingers move up and down, and not back and forth.  The same part of the finger should touch the same place on the key every time.\nWhen hand position has been correctly mastered, the balance points on the fully-assembled flute are:\nRight hand thumb\nLeft hand index finger\nLedge of chin\nRight hand pinky\nItems That Will Help Hand Position\nDr. Scholl’s Mole Foam Padding\nBo Pep Thumb Guide for Right Hand\nBo Pep Thumb Guide for Left Hand\nDr. Scholl’s Corn Removers Ultra-Thin\nSolexa Thumb Port\nPrima Thumb Rest\nPencil Grips\nOBOE HAND POSITION\nPlace the right hand first, with the lower joint and bell supported by the leg.  The upper joint can be gently held by the left hand as you begin the awkward process of finding the correct place for every finger.\nPlace the fleshy finger pads over the keys first.  Without putting pressure on the finger tips, be sure all holes are covered.\nThe hand will begin in a straight across angle, and will be in the “flat-C” position.  Eventually, as with the clarinet, they will slant into the “V” position.\nPlace the thumb on the thumb rest between the rest and the leg.  The thumb nail touches the rest.  Very little (preferably, no) flesh will touch the thumb rest.  The thumb joint must always be to the right of the thumb rest, never behind it.\nTurn the oboe out in front of the student like a spyglass and make sure there is open space between the body of the oboe and the hand.\nThe pinky rests on the most comfortable home key it will use later in this process.\nThe middle finger will appear higher because it is longer than the other fingers.\nThe middle finger should be very close to perpendicular to the joint.\nNo part of any finger should touch any rod.\nPractice moving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.  Do not let the other two knuckles move.  The finger pads should fall directly into the holes.  In the beginning the pinky can move up and down also.\nLean the oboe back on the shoulder and look at the right hand fingers as you do this.  While doing this, the left hand must remain in its proper “baby” position holding the upper joint.\nSaying “squeeze….release” for finger movement will help the fingers move from the big knuckles and understand the “timing” of fingers.\nMake sure to feel all parts of the keys with the finger pads.\nDo not include side keys in the initial hand position information.  When  asked by students, tell them once the hands can move using the keys correctly, they will be allowed to use the keys on the side.\nLEFT HAND POSITION\nALWAYS KEEP ONE HAND ON THE OBOE AT ALL TIMES.  NEVER SIMPLY LAY IT IN THE LAP.\nKeep the thumb perpendicular to the back of the instrument.\nThe middle knuckle of the index finger is placed over one of the octave keys.\nThe fingers are slightly slanted downward.\nPlace the index, middle, and ring fingers on the keys with holes.\nBeginners can have “fly-away” fingers in the beginning as long as they fall back down to the correct rings.  Always feel the palm of the hands to check for the softness of the fingers.  There are more bones in this area of the hand than any other part of the body.  If the palm is soft, all other parts of the hand will be as naturally soft as is possible.  The pinkies should have comfortable “home keys” they touch all of the time in the beginning stages.\nBe patient with progress toward absolute correct hand position.  It is best to have “double jointed” students not play the oboe.\nThe body of the oboe is very small.  Hand position can feel very awkward. The student should be made aware of the oboe’s double octave key system, and that the middle finger will appear higher because it is longer than the other fingers.\nUsing the previously mentioned “squeeze….release” exercises, practice moving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.  Do not let the other two knuckles move.  The finger pads should fall directly into the holes.  In the beginning the pinky can move up and down also.\nDo not include side keys in the initial hand position information.  When asked, tell students once their hands can move using the keys correctly, they will be allowed to use the keys on the side.\nBASSOON-BALANCING THE BASSOON/ HAND POSITION\nPlace the seat strap across the FRONT of the chair. Make sure that the cup or hook of the seat strap is on the right side.\nSit towards the back of the chair while holding the instrument. Make sure the right side of the body is aligned with the right side of the chair.\nLook for an indentation on the base of the spine above the belt line.\nThe height of the student should be maximized.\nAssuming the student’s posture is correct, the shoulder blades should be even (level) across the back.\nDo not let the students distort their torso.\nHook the instrument to the seat strap and adjust the strap until the bocal is entering straight into the mouths while seated in a relaxed position.\nPlace the left hand on the instrument, demonstrating the position of the fingers on the tone holes……and with the thumb on the wisper key. After the fingers have been positioned in the correct place, become aware of where the bassoon is balanced on the index finger. Allow the right hand to loosely position over the boot or on the crutch.\nIdeally, the weight of the instrument should be balanced by the body and not leaning too heavily on the left hand. Avoid holding the instrument at an angle like a saxophone, because the weight of the instrument will cause the student to lean forward and the left hand will be strained under the pressure.\nOnce the teacher is comfortable with the student’s posture, the student can walk around the room holding the bassoon. Hold the seat strap in the right hand, which is holding the boot in place…and the right hand should hold the wing/long joint.  The parts of the bassoon will not slip apart if students are holding it in this manner. This will furthermore allow students to become more comfortable holding the bassoon.\nCLARINET HAND POSITION\nPlace the right hand first, with the lower joint supported by the leg.  The right hand lifts the instrument, and the placement is less difficult or complicated.  The upper joint can be gently held by the left hand as you begin the awkward process of finding the correct place for every finger.\nPlace the fleshy finger pads over the silver rings first.  Without putting pressure on the finger tips, feel the pads fall into the holes.\nThe hand will begin in a straight across angle, and will be in the “flat-C” position…not too curved and not too straight.\nPlace the thumb on the thumb rest between the rest and the leg.  The thumb nail touches the rest. Very little (preferably, no) flesh will touch the thumb rest.  The thumb joint must always be to the right of the thumb rest, never behind it.\nTurn the clarinet out in front of the student like a spyglass and make sure there is open space between the body of the clarinet and the hand.\nThe pinky rests on the most comfortable of the four keys it will use later in this process (either key #1, which is the low F key—or key #2, which is the low G#/Ab key).  The pinky should not be straight; it needs to be curved. Watch for pinkies that disappear either under the clarinet or under the pinky keys.\nLean the clarinet back on the left shoulder and look at the right hand fingers as you do this.  While doing this, the left hand must remain in its proper “baby position” holding the upper joint.\nMake sure to feel all parts of the ring with the finger pads.\nKeep the right hand straight across the body of the clarinet for at least 6 to 8 weeks before moving into the more correct angled position.  This makes it easier for the ring finger and pinky to function more comfortably.\nDo not include side keys in the initial hand position information.  If asked, tell them once the hands can move correctly using the rings and tone holes, they will be allowed to learn to use the keys on the side.\nLEFT HAND POSITION  *critical and paramount to the success of playing the clarinet\nWhile holding the lower joint gently (not using correct hand position but the proper “baby” position) with the right hand as it rests on the leg, place the middle knuckle of the index finger on the G# key at the top of the upper joint.  Place the first knuckle on the A key with the fleshy part of the tip angled down toward the first silver ring.  The teacher will have to identify these “named keys” for the student.\nPlace the middle finger over the second silver ring.\nPlace the ring finger over the third hole with no silver ring.\nPlace the thumb over the ring on the back of the upper joint with the fleshy part of the end being aware of the long, skinny key (register key).  The angle of the thumb should be at “1:00/2:00.”\nThe pinky will rest on the most comfortable of the four keys it will use later in this process (either key #1, which is the low E key—or key #4, which is the low C# key). The pinky should not be straight; it needs to be curved.  Watch for pinkies that disappear either under the clarinet or under the pinky keys.\nKeep the hand in an adjusted “flat-C” position and the wrist slightly up.  The wrist must stay in line with the rest of the forearm.\nContinue to rest the clarinet on the leg and watch to see if the left hand follows the line of the upper joint to form the angle of a “V” with the upper joint.\nDo not allow the knuckles of the index finger to lose contact with the G# and A keys.  For example, A should not be played without the index finger also touching (not pressing) the G#/Ab key.\nIf the thumb is not being used to play specific sounds on the instrument it MUST NOT touch the body (wood) of the instrument.\nALWAYS KEEP ONE HAND ON THE CLARINET AT ALL TIMES.  NEVER SIMPLY LAY IT IN THE LAP.\nBeginners can have “fly-away” fingers in the beginning as long as they fall back down to the correct rings.  The exception is the left index finger.  If we try to get them to keep their fingers in the “finished” position too soon, the hands can become too tense.  Always feel the palm of the hands to check for the softness of the fingers.  There are more bones in this area of the hand than any other part of the body.  If the palm is soft, all other parts of the hand will be as naturally soft as is possible.  The pinkies should have comfortable “home keys” they touch all of the time in the beginning stages.\nBeginning clarinet hand position is very awkward, thus taking longer to achieve and more patience from the teacher and student is required.  Do not get in a hurry.\nSAXOPHONE HAND POSITION\nAlways place the right hand first.\nThe second knuckle of the thumb should be placed under the right edge of the thumb rest.\nFingers should be placed on the pearls. The fleshy part will touch the pearls.\nThe pinky rests on the most comfortable of the two roller keys it will use later in this process (either the higher key, which is the low Eb key—or the lower key, which is the low C key).  The pinky should not be straight; it needs to be curved.  Watch for pinkies that disappear either under the saxophone or under the pinky keys.\nFingers should be curved and round—not flat.\nThe wrist must stay in line with the rest of the forearm.  The wrist should not collapse into the side keys.\nPractice moving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.  Do not let the other two knuckles move.  The finger pads should stay on the pearls at all times. In the beginning the pinky can move up and down also.\nThe left thumb rests on the back thumb rest and never leaves.  The second knuckle should basically be in the middle of the thumb rest.\nPlace the index finger on the first pearl.  The Yamaha YAS-23 and other brands feature an extra pearl, or “teardrop key” which will need to be skipped.\nSkip the small pearl (bis key).\nPlace the middle and ring finger on the next two pearls.  The finger pads should stay on the pearls at all times.\nThe pinky should rest on the “home key,” which is the G#/Ab key.  The pinky should not be straight; it needs to be curved.  Watch for pinkies that disappear either under the saxophone or under the pinky keys.\nFingers should remain on the pearls and be curved and round, and not ever go past the pearls (resulting in flat fingers).\nAlways feel the palm of the hands to check for the softness of the fingers.  There are more bones in this area of the hand than any other part of the body.  If the palm is soft, all other parts of the hand will be as naturally soft as is possible.  The pinkies should have comfortable “home keys” they touch all of the time in the beginning stages.\nTRUMPET HAND POSITION\nThe most natural shape of everyone’s hands forms a “flat-C.”\nAll hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall behind the wrist.\nThere should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the trumpet.\nThe inside of the arm must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding the trumpet correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\nElbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be hampered.\nPlace both the left and the right hand in their correct position.  Remember the left hand does not “grip” the instrument.  No tension should be felt in this hand when holding the instrument.\nThe right thumb is placed in its natural position, which is between the first and second valve casing.  The thumb must never bend in any direction!  The index, middle and ring fingers are curved and the fleshy part of the fingertips is placed on the pearls of the valve caps and should never lose contact with the caps.  The pinky is slightly curved and placed on TOP of the “ring.”  This pinky should never be placed INSIDE the “ring”, as this will cause students to “pull” the instrument into their embouchure and cause major problems.\nThough not a part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling the instrument toward the student’s face.  Instruct students to keep their elbows soft while playing the trumpet.\nThe palms of both hands should feel soft.  The palm of the right hand should never touch the instrument.  The teacher should be able to clearly see a “circular” opening between the right hand and the instrument.\nThe student should understand that finger movement is aided by the soft tissue of the palm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand.\nFRENCH HORN HAND POSITION\nThere should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the French horn.\nThe inside of the arm must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding the French horn correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\nPlace both the left and the right hand in their correct “beginner” position.  The left hand is placed on the valves and will lie in the “flat-C” position.  No tension should be felt in this hand, as the fingers move “with” the valves.\nThe right hand will be cupped on the outer ridge of the bottom of the bell.  Both hands hold and balance the French horn in the beginning.  The horn does not rest on the leg.  The right hand is not placed inside the bell until the teacher determines that the student can balance the horn in this manner.  An added bonus to holding the French horn by the bottom of the bell will result in the student being able to hear—and expect to hear—a more resonant sound when the hand is finally in its correct/more advanced position inside the bell.\nThough not a part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling the instrument toward the student’s face.  Instruct students to keep their elbows soft while playing the French horn.\nThe palms of both hands should feel soft.\nThe teacher must watch young students closely to monitor that their shoulders stay balanced and feel naturally soft at all times.\nAlthough single F horns are lighter and easier for students to control in the beginning stages of playing, it is suggested that beginning French horn students are started on double horns. Of course, this decision may be dictated by what instruments are available in your inventory.\nTROMBONE HAND POSITION\nWith the left hand, form an “L” or a gun.  Have the student wrap the bottom three fingers around the left brace of the slide while the thumb wraps around the brace of the bell.  The index finger should lie relaxed on top of the upper brace slide.\nThe thick pads of the left hand should never overlap to the outer slide.  Students will “clip” their hands when moving the slide.  This is the most common beginner “injury,” and it can be easily avoided.\nThe right hand should hold the slide with the fleshy part of the index and middle fingers and thumb (“two fingers and a thumb”).\nBring the instrument to the face.  Though not a part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling the instrument toward the student’s face.  Instruct students to keep their elbows soft while playing the trombone.\nAn “X” should form between the left and right arms and elbows should be on the same plane when holding the instrument correctly.\nBoth hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall behind the wrist.\nThere should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the trombone.\nThe inside of the arm must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding the trombone correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\nRemember, the left hand does not “grip” the instrument.  No tension should be felt in this hand when holding the instrument.\nThe palms of both hands should feel soft.  The palm of the right hand should never touch the instrument.  The teacher should be able to clearly see a “circular” opening between the right hand and the slide.\nThe student should understand that slide movement is aided by the soft tissue of the palm of the hand, rather than the bony texture on the top of the hand.\nThe trombone is the most awkward instrument to hold out of all brass instruments, and students should constantly be reminded to keep a calm mind and a calm body.  Take frequent breaks so that students can build endurance when learning how to hold the instrument to avoid bad habits from forming."

The pinky rests on the most comfortable home key it will use later in this\nprocess.\n7.  The middle finger will appear higher because it is longer than the other\nfingers.\n8.  The middle finger should be very close to perpendicular to the joint.\n9.  No part of any finger should touch any rod.\n10. Practice moving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.

Make sure that the cup or\nhook of the seat strap is on the right side.\n  Sit towards the back of the chair while holding the instrument. Make sure the\nright side of the body is aligned with the right side of the chair.\n  Look for an indentation on the base of the spine above the belt line.\n  The height of the student should be maximized.\n  Assuming the student’s posture is correct, the shoulder blades should be even\n(level) across the back.\n  Do not let the students distort their torso.\n  Hook the instrument to the seat strap and adjust the strap until the bocal is\nentering straight into the mouths while seated in a relaxed position.\n\n  Place the left hand on the instrument, demonstrating the position of the fingers\non the tone holes……and with the thumb on the wisper key. After the fingers\nhave been positioned in the correct place, become aware of where the bassoon\nis balanced on the index finger. Allow the right hand to loosely position over\nthe boot or on the crutch.\nIdeally, the weight of the instrument should be balanced by the body and not\nleaning too heavily on the left hand. Avoid holding the instrument at an angle\nlike a saxophone, because the weight of the instrument will cause the student\nto lean forward and the left hand will be strained under the pressure.\n  Once the teacher is comfortable with the student’s posture, the student can\nwalk around the room holding the bassoon. Hold the seat strap in the right\nhand, which is holding the boot in place…and the right hand should hold the\nwing/long joint.  The parts of the bassoon will not slip apart if students are\nholding it in this manner. This will furthermore allow students to become\nmore comfortable holding the bassoon.\nCLARINET HAND POSITION\n1.  Place the right hand first, with the lower joint supported by the leg.  The right\nhand lifts the instrument, and the placement is less difficult or complicated.\n2.  Place the fleshy finger pads over the silver rings first.  Without putting\npressure on the finger tips, feel the pads fall into the holes.\nposition…not too curved and not too straight.\nnail touches the rest. Very little (preferably, no) flesh will touch the thumb\n5.  Turn the clarinet out in front of the student like a spyglass and make sure there\nis open space between the body of the clarinet and the hand.\n6.  The pinky rests on the most comfortable of the four keys it will use later in\nthis process (either key #1, which is the low F key—or key #2, which is the\nlow G#/Ab key).  The pinky should not be straight; it needs to be curved.\nWatch for pinkies that disappear either under the clarinet or under the pinky\n8.  No part of any finger should touch any rod.\n9.  Practice moving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.  Do not let\n10. Lean the clarinet back on the left shoulder and look at the right hand fingers as\nyou do this.  While doing this, the left hand must remain in its proper “baby\nposition” holding the upper joint.\n11. Make sure to feel all parts of the ring with the finger pads.\n12. Keep the right hand straight across the body of the clarinet for at least 6 to 8\nweeks before moving into the more correct angled position.  This makes it\neasier for the ring finger and pinky to function more comfortably.\n13. Do not include side keys in the initial hand position information.  If asked, tell\nthem once the hands can move correctly using the rings and tone holes, they\nwill be allowed to learn to use the keys on the side.\nLEFT HAND POSITION  *critical and paramount to the success of playing\nthe clarinet\n1.  While holding the lower joint gently (not using correct hand position but the\nproper “baby” position) with the right hand as it rests on the leg, place the\nmiddle knuckle of the index finger on the G# key at the top of the upper joint.\nPlace the first knuckle on the A key with the fleshy part of the tip angled\ndown toward the first silver ring.  The teacher will have to identify these\n“named keys” for the student.\n2.  Place the middle finger over the second silver ring.\n3.  Place the ring finger over the third hole with no silver ring.\n4.  Place the thumb over the ring on the back of the upper joint with the fleshy\npart of the end being aware of the long, skinny key (register key).  The angle\nof the thumb should be at “1:00/2:00.”\n5.  The pinky will rest on the most comfortable of the four keys it will use later in\nthis process (either key #1, which is the low E key—or key #4, which is the\nlow C# key). The pinky should not be straight; it needs to be curved.  Watch\nfor pinkies that disappear either under the clarinet or under the pinky keys.\n6.  Keep the hand in an adjusted “flat-C” position and the wrist slightly up.  The\nwrist must stay in line with the rest of the forearm.\n7.  Continue to rest the clarinet on the leg and watch to see if the left hand\nfollows the line of the upper joint to form the angle of a “V” with the upper\njoint.\n8.  Do not allow the knuckles of the index finger to lose contact with the G# and\nA keys.  For example, A should not be played without the index finger also\ntouching (not pressing) the G#/Ab key.\n9.  If the thumb is not being used to play specific sounds on the instrument it\nMUST NOT touch the body (wood) of the instrument.\n10. ALWAYS KEEP ONE HAND ON THE CLARINET AT ALL TIMES.\nNEVER SIMPLY LAY IT IN THE LAP.\n11. Beginners can have “fly-away” fingers in the beginning as long as they fall\nback down to the correct rings.  The exception is the left index finger.  If we\ntry to get them to keep their fingers in the “finished” position too soon, the\nhands can become too tense.  Always feel the palm of the hands to check for\nthe softness of the fingers.  There are more bones in this area of the hand than\nany other part of the body.  If the palm is soft, all other parts of the hand will\nbe as naturally soft as is possible.  The pinkies should have comfortable\n12. Beginning clarinet hand position is very awkward, thus taking longer to\nachieve and more patience from the teacher and student is required.  Do not\nget in a hurry.\nSAXOPHONE HAND POSITION\n1.  Always place the right hand first.\n2.  The second knuckle of the thumb should be placed under the right edge of the\nthumb rest.\n3.  Fingers should be placed on the pearls. The fleshy part will touch the pearls.\n4.  The pinky rests on the most comfortable of the two roller keys it will use later\nin this process (either the higher key, which is the low Eb key—or the lower\nkey, which is the low C key).  The pinky should not be straight; it needs to be\ncurved.  Watch for pinkies that disappear either under the saxophone or under\nthe pinky keys.\n5.  Fingers should be curved and round—not flat.\n6.  The wrist must stay in line with the rest of the forearm.  The wrist should not\ncollapse into the side keys.\n7.  Practice moving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.  Do not let\nthe other two knuckles move.  The finger pads should stay on the pearls at all\ntimes. In the beginning the pinky can move up and down also.\n8.  Do not include side keys in the initial hand position information.  If asked, tell\n1.  The left thumb rests on the back thumb rest and never leaves.  The second\nknuckle should basically be in the middle of the thumb rest.\n2.  Place the index finger on the first pearl.  The Yamaha YAS-23 and other\nbrands feature an extra pearl, or “teardrop key” which will need to be skipped.\n3.  Skip the small pearl (bis key).\n4.  Place the middle and ring finger on the next two pearls.  The finger pads\nshould stay on the pearls at all times.\n5.  The pinky should rest on the “home key,” which is the G#/Ab key.  The pinky\nshould not be straight; it needs to be curved.  Watch for pinkies that disappear\neither under the saxophone or under the pinky keys.\n6.  Fingers should remain on the pearls and be curved and round, and not ever go\npast the pearls (resulting in flat fingers).\n7.  Keep the hand in an adjusted “flat-C” position and the wrist slightly up.  The\n8.  Always feel the palm of the hands to check for the softness of the fingers.\nThere are more bones in this area of the hand than any other part of the body.\nIf the palm is soft, all other parts of the hand will be as naturally soft as is\npossible.  The pinkies should have comfortable “home keys” they touch all of\nthe time in the beginning stages.\nTRUMPET HAND POSITION\n1.  The most natural shape of everyone’s hands forms a “flat-C.”\n2.  All hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall\nbehind the wrist.\n3.  There should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the trumpet.\n4.  The inside of the arm must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when\nholding the trumpet correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\n5.  Elbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be\nhampered.\n6.  Place both the left and the right hand in their correct position.  Remember the\nleft hand does not “grip” the instrument.  No tension should be felt in this\nhand when holding the instrument.\n7.  The right thumb is placed in its natural position, which is between the first and\nsecond valve casing.  The thumb must never bend in any direction!  The\nindex, middle and ring fingers are curved and the fleshy part of the fingertips\nis placed on the pearls of the valve caps and should never lose contact with the\ncaps.  The pinky is slightly curved and placed on TOP of the “ring.”  This\npinky should never be placed INSIDE the “ring”, as this will cause students to\n“pull” the instrument into their embouchure and cause major problems.\n8.  Though not a part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are\npulling the instrument toward the student’s face.  Instruct students to keep\ntheir elbows soft while playing the trumpet.\n9.  The palms of both hands should feel soft.  The palm of the right hand should\nnever touch the instrument.  The teacher should be able to clearly see a\n“circular” opening between the right hand and the instrument.\n10. The student should understand that finger movement is aided by the soft tissue\nof the palm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand.\nFRENCH HORN HAND POSITION\n2.  All hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall behind\nthe wrist.\n3.  There should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the French horn.\nholding the French horn correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\n6.  Place both the left and the right hand in their correct “beginner” position.  The left\nhand is placed on the valves and will lie in the “flat-C” position.  No tension\nshould be felt in this hand, as the fingers move “with” the valves.\n7.  The right hand will be cupped on the outer ridge of the bottom of the bell.  Both\nhands hold and balance the French horn in the beginning.  The horn does not rest\non the leg.  The right hand is not placed inside the bell until the teacher\ndetermines that the student can balance the horn in this manner.  An added bonus\nto holding the French horn by the bottom of the bell will result in the student\nbeing able to hear—and expect to hear—a more resonant sound when the hand is\nfinally in its correct/more advanced position inside the bell.\npulling the instrument toward the student’s face.  Instruct students to keep their\nelbows soft while playing the French horn.\n9.  The palms of both hands should feel soft.\n10. The teacher must watch young students closely to monitor that their shoulders\nstay balanced and feel naturally soft at all times.\n  Although single F horns are lighter and easier for students to control in the\nbeginning stages of playing, it is suggested that beginning French horn\nstudents are started on double horns. Of course, this decision may be\ndictated by what instruments are available in your inventory.\nTROMBONE HAND POSITION\n1.  With the left hand, form an “L” or a gun.  Have the student wrap the bottom three\nfingers around the left brace of the slide while the thumb wraps around the brace\nof the bell.  The index finger should lie relaxed on top of the upper brace slide.\n2.  The thick pads of the left hand should never overlap to the outer slide.  Students\nwill “clip” their hands when moving the slide.  This is the most common beginner\n“injury,” and it can be easily avoided.\n3.  The right hand should hold the slide with the fleshy part of the index and middle\nfingers and thumb (“two fingers and a thumb”).\n4.  Bring the instrument to the face.  Though not a part of the hand, the elbows must\nnever feel as though they are pulling the instrument toward the student’s face.\nInstruct students to keep their elbows soft while playing the trombone.\n5.  An “X” should form between the left and right arms and elbows should be on the\nsame plane when holding the instrument correctly.\n6.  Both hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall\n7.  There should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the trombone.\n8.  The inside of the arm must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when\nholding the trombone correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\n9.  Elbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be\n10. Remember, the left hand does not “grip” the instrument.  No tension should be\nfelt in this hand when holding the instrument.\n11. The palms of both hands should feel soft.  The palm of the right hand should\nnever touch the instrument.  The teacher should be able to clearly see a “circular”\nopening between the right hand and the slide.\n12. The student should understand that slide movement is aided by the soft tissue of\nthe palm of the hand, rather than the bony texture on the top of the hand.\n13. The trombone is the most awkward instrument to hold out of all brass\ninstruments, and students should constantly be reminded to keep a calm mind and\na calm body.  Take frequent breaks so that students can build endurance when\nlearning how to hold the instrument to avoid bad habits from forming."

    "text": "HOW TO REHEARSE PARTICULAR\nENSEMBLE FUNDAMENTALS WHILE\nINCLUDING ALL STUDENTS\nBalance\n•  While creating balance, it is imperative that students are participatory and aware of their\nindividual and section responsibilities to create the desired musical effect.\n•  Directors must teach students what the intent of the composer is, in regards to how their\npart “fits into” the ensemble\n•\n•  Director must identify the various compositional techniques which are employed by the\ncomposer (i.e. melody, accompaniment, melody with ostinatos, melody with counter-\nmelody, etc.).\nIt is important to remember that the most difficult technique will be found when teaching\nbalance of a particular composition which includes a fugue.  Because the fugue is the\nmost important aspect of the piece, students must be aware of when the piece can too\neasily become “busy” and confusing to the listener, especially if the students do not know\ntheir importance within the structure of the composition.\nIn order to make students aware of their importance in a piece, it is imperative that when\nidentifying a soloist, section or specific part within a section, younger students need to\nwrite the name of the student or section in their own parts.  Students today are very visual\nlearners, and this expectation will allow students to see a visual “reminder” as they\nprogress through a piece.  Rehearsal time will be more efficient if students are actively\nmaking these markings in their music.\n•  When practicing balance, you are encouraged to have the soloist or section/part actually\nplay their parts……but with all other students in their exact playing position posture.\nDuring this time, students must always be listening to the melodic material……and at the\nsame time should be expected to position only…and later position while using the air\nthey use to make their most resonant sound.\nStyle\nDecide which basic fundamental actually creates the desired stylistic effect.\nArticulation\nWhen teaching articulation, various exercises should be incorporated within a rehearsal.\n•  Air against the hand\n•  Air through the instrument (including positioning)\n•  Actual performance practice\nBreathing\n•  Do you keep your breath smooth and calmer……..or is it is used in a more compact and\n•  Use breathing exercises:  tonguing across one airstream with slight spaces long-lifted\nand/or lifted), or without spaces at all (legato)\n•  Using the air, either keeping your diaphragm extended or allowing it to move and support\nthe sound with individual units of air.  (The diaphragm will move while creating these units\nof air.)\n•  Whether or not the diaphragm moves, the vowel sound at the end must be the same.\n•  Regarding legato style, it is important that the tongue moves exactly with the fingers or\nslide positions.  This same concept can be applied, regardless of the amount of space between\nsounds, used to create the desired style.\n•  All styles are related; the importance of a clear tongue start, producing a resonant sound\nwith a clean release, should be present in every note….regardless of the chosen style.\nIs it a special effect?\n•  Do your students understand the difference between style markings and special effect\nmarkings?  Teach your students the visual markings that will create a specific style (i.e.\ntenuto, long-lifted, regular accents, marcato accents, etc.).\no  Tenuto style is more about the air follow-though, as well as phrase direction.  The\nstarts and ends of notes should not be effected at all when playing in a tenuto\nstyle.\no  Regular accents require the same exact articulation, but with more weight in the\nbody of the actual note/sound.\no  Marcato accents require a broader/firmer articulation with the required weight in\nthe body of the actual note/sound.\no  Long-lifted style is the most difficult to achieve because of the mere fact that\nstudents can easily play a note either too long…..or too short.  Long-lifted style is\nas much about mental concentration as it is about the note start, note length, etc.\nSpace must be created while the illusion of phrase direction is not impaired.\n•  Make sure they understand that certain markings (i.e. fz, ffz, etc.) are effects created by\nweight rather than by strength of articulation).\n•  Special effect notes should have all of the qualities of non-special effect notes (i.e.\ncharacteristic sound, focus, energy, release, etc.)\nIs it a vowel?\n•  Vowel sounds control the resonance in particular register of brass instruments and control\ncolor and resonance of all woodwind instruments.\n•  The major difference of the use of vowel sounds in brass and woodwind instruments is\nthe importance of vowel sound in register changes.  These changes are more frequent and\nmore basic for brass (it is how you change registers), and less frequent in woodwinds\nwhere they are used to control color and pitch control.\nTechnical Facility\n•  From the very beginning, students must be reminded that the texture of the body parts\nnever change, regardless of the speed of movement.\n•  At all levels of performance, students must always be reminded that all finger movement\nis controlled by the first (big) knuckle.\n(cid:1)  Exceptions:\no  flute left hand index finger\no  clarinet left hand index finger\no  Because of the lack of a “mouthpiece,” oboe and bassoon players must be\no\nespecially aware of body texture and hand position at all times.  Reed vibration\ncan be negatively affected by any force or tension felt in the body or embouchure.\ntrombone positions are created at the elbow and pitch tendencies are adjusted at\nthe wrist\no  regarding piston valve brass instruments, the palms of the hand should be soft and\nthe thumb is never bent\no  regarding rotary valve brass instruments, the fingers lie flat\nthe elbows must be soft and must not pull toward the body, especially when\ntempos/rhythms become significantly more active……….and tessitura becomes a\nfactor in brass playing"

There is a slight\n“break”  in  the  shape  of  the  hand  and  wrist.\n(cid:120)  LH index finger first knuckle should be between the first two physical keys of the\nflute; not closer to the first physical key thus resulting in flat fingers.\n(cid:120)  Be sure the palms of the hands are soft so no tension is felt or seen.\nCLARINET\n(cid:120)  RH thumb should not be too far to the left of the thumb rest; the thumb rest never\ngoes past the cuticle.\n(cid:120)  RH fingers should be curved.\n(cid:120)  RH fingers should not collapse into the rods.\n(cid:120)  RH pinky must always hover near the F/C key and have curvature.\n(cid:120)  RH index finger should not support the clarinet or be used as a balance point.\nThis also results in flat fingers.\n(cid:120)  LH index must never lose contact with the G# and A keys.\n(cid:120)  Tip of LH index finger should angle down to the first silver ring.\n(cid:120)  LH pinky should always hover near the E/B key and have curvature.\n(cid:120)  LH thumb should be at 1:00-2:00 and must only move from the middle knuckle;\nthumb should not be perpendicular or parallel to the clarinet.\n(cid:120)  LH thumb should never touch wood (body of instrument).\n(cid:120)  RH and LH ping pong ball/marble reference\n(cid:120)  Be sure that no finger touches another key while playing.\n(cid:120)  Elbows should not collapse into the body while playing.\nSAXOPHONE\n(cid:120)  RH index finger should not collapse into any of the side keys.\n(cid:120)  RH pinky should be curved.\n(cid:120)  Fingers should be placed on the pearls.  The fleshy part will stay in contact with\nthe pearls.\n(cid:120)  The  little  finger  should  rest  on  the  roller  keys.    “Home  position”  will  be  the  Eb\nkey, which is the higher of the two keys.\n(cid:120)  LH thumb should rest on the back thumb rest and never leave.  The second\nknuckle should basically be in the middle of the thumb rest.\n(cid:120)  Wrists should not collapse into the instrument, thus resulting in broken wrist and\nflat fingers.\nPalm Keys\n(cid:120)  When utilizing palm keys, keep fingers as close to their original placement as\npossible while using the wrist to help facilitate. The detailed information below\nwill enhance your instruction of this challenging component regarding saxophone\nhand position.\n(cid:120)  High D – “PK  1” (PK closest to the octave key)\no  Use the LH index finger, 1st (big) knuckle.\no  Keep the other fingers curved and hovering over the pearls.\n(cid:120)  High D # - “PK  1  and  2”\no  Use the LH index finger, 2nd (middle) knuckle\n*PK 2 is the highest key on the instrument (vertically) and centered\nbetween the other two PKs (horizontally)\no  Keep the other fingers curved, relaxed, and hovering.\no  This is where tension begins to creep into the palm – keep it relaxed.\n(cid:120)  High E – “PK  1  and  2”  plus RH top side key\no  LH remains the same – keep it relaxed.\no  Add the top side key in the RH – use the space between the big and middle\nknuckle.\n(cid:131)\nIt is VERY IMPORTANT that the student’s  right  hand  position\nstay as close to normal as possible. Ensure the right hand fingers\nstay as close to hovering over the pearls as possible. Students tend\nto contort and move the entire hand to activate this key, which is\ninefficient.\n(cid:120)  High F – “PK  1,  2  and  3”  plus RH top side key\no  LH adds the third palm key using the 2nd (middle knuckle) of the LH\nmiddle finger…not the index finger!\no  Keep the palm soft and relaxed.\no  Hand should remain curved.\no  Like high E, the RH hand position should stay as close to normal as\npossible.\n*Remember, the higher the tone hole is, the higher the pitch is.\nBeginning students have smaller hands, so you will have to be forgiving if their hands are\nnot quite big enough to execute the technique exactly listed.  Some exceptions will have\nto be made.  Have students practice palm key exercises every other day for short intervals\nas their hands will get tired.\nPinky Keys\n(cid:120)  When utilizing pinky keys, it is important that students land on the roller and\nnever past it.  Slide roller to roller not key to key.  The pinky should never be\npicked up when moving from roller to roller.\n(cid:120)  Right Hand--When moving from the D#/Eb (upstairs) key to the C (downstairs)\nkey, it is important to land on the roller, never past it. Slide roller to roller, NOT\nkey to key.\n(cid:120)  Practice exercises moving from D#/Eb to C not playing and playing. Practice\nthese in short intervals as the pinkies will get tired. Teach your students to work\non these two or three times during their practice session for short amounts of time\nevery other day.\n(cid:120)  Left Hand--When using the LH pinky, it is important that students NEVER pick\nthe pinky up when moving between keys!\n(cid:120)  When using the C#/Db and the B key, slide roller to roller, NOT key to key.\n(cid:120)  When using A#/Bb, students can either move roller to roller, or pivot the LH\npinky down.  The  pinky  leans  down  and  never  leaves  the  bottom  of  the  B  “inside”\nkey, which means that students must bring their hand lower.  The faster students\nplay, the more they must pivot from their wrist.\no  The low A#/Bb keys on most Selmer saxophones can be raised by a\nskilled repairman, so there is less of a downwards motion.\n(cid:120)  The B key is lower on all saxophones; however, a skilled repairman can bend the\nkey higher.\no  The B and C#/Db keys on beginner Yamaha saxophones should already be\nflush.\n(cid:120)  Practice exercises moving from C#/Db to B, and B to Bb (harder). The same\npractice rules apply.\n(cid:120)  Do not attempt to hold the saxophone with your hands, as this will result in poor\ntechnique, etc.  Balance the saxophone in the manner discussed earlier.\nTRUMPET\n(cid:120)  RH thumb should not be bent back.  The RH thumb and first finger must always\npoint in the same direction.\n(cid:120)  RH fingers should have curvature; the pads of the fingers should not extend past\n(cid:120)  RH palms should not collapse into body of instruments.\n(cid:120)  RH pinky should not be placed in the ring.\n(cid:120)  LH thumb should  be  placed  in  the  saddle,  etc…not in upright position…and  not\ncompletely curved around the instrument (for students with larger hands).\nIf both thumbs are placed correctly, they should not touch, cross, or be anywhere\nnear each other.\n(cid:120)\n(cid:120)  Remember  the  left  hand  does  not  “grip”  the  instrument.    No  tension  should  be\nfelt in this hand when holding the instrument. (The exception is beginners with\nvery small hands.)\n(cid:120)  Wrists should not collapse into the instrument.\n(cid:120)  Watch for soft elbows and hands while students are playing.\n(cid:120)  RH ping pong ball reference\n(cid:120)  LH marble reference\nFRENCH HORN\n(cid:120)  There should not be bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the French\nhorn.\n(cid:120)  The inside of the arm should never touch the outside of the chest cavity when\nholding the French horn correctly.  No body part should touch another body part!\n(cid:120)  Elbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be\nhampered.\n(cid:120)  LH  wrist  should  be  straightened  by  moving  the  bell  away  from  the  body…not  by\nraising the left elbow.\n(cid:120)  LH fingers lie flat on rotary valves, and should not be curved.\n(cid:120)  The palms of both hands should feel soft.\n(cid:120)  The RH should be flexible because it is often used for tuning purposes.\nTROMBONE\n(cid:120)  Students  should  never  be  allowed  to  “gauge”  3rd positions at the bell.\n(cid:120)  RH thumb, index and 2nd finger should always remain on the crossbar; the slide\nshould never be gripped by the entire hand in an awkward position, thus\nresulting in incorrect wrist placement.\n(cid:120)  LH index finger should naturally curve over the shank of the mouthpiece, never\nunderneath the cross bar.\n(cid:120)  Students  should  not  use  their  right  foot  to  “achieve”  6th/7th position; nor should\ntheir right foot be used to empty their spit valve.\n(cid:120)  Elbows are directly responsible for basic muscle memory to create correct\npositions.  Wrists are used to adjust inherent and errant pitch tendencies.\nEUPHONIUM/TUBA\n(cid:120)  The euphonium RH thumb and 1st finger should point in same direction.  The\nthumb should not be wrapped around the valve casing (older, three valve\ninstruments)…which  results  in  the  palm  collapsing  into  the  cross  brace.\n(cid:120)  The palm should not collapse into the cross brace.\n(cid:120)  Piston valves are approached basically the same as trumpet.  Rotary valves are\nbasically approached the same as French horn.\n(cid:120)  Students with compensating fourth valves must move their LH index finger\n(NOT second finger) in the same manner that they move their other valves.\n(cid:120)  Elbows should not collapse into body while playing.\n(cid:120)  The tuba LH should always be holding the tuba in a manner that does not disturb\nthe balance of the upper body and shoulders.\n(cid:120)  As soon as appropriate, students should be shown how the LH is used to\nmanipulate the first valve slide.\nMore detailed information on all major\ninstruments can be found at:\nFLUTE HAND POSITION\nRIGHT HAND POSITION\n1.  Allow the flute to lie back against the left shoulder.  The left hand makes a\nloose fist around the open area at the barrel of the flute.\n2.  Place the fingers first by touching the last three keys on the body of the flute\nwith the index, middle and ring finger.\n3.  The fleshy finger pad (pudgy part of your finger) should touch the pads/plugs.\n4.  Shape  the  hand  like  a  “C”  (“flat-C”  or  “U”  on  its  side).  The fleshy part should\nbe in the center of the keys.  Most flutes have circles on the keys.  These\ncircles can be used as guidelines for finger placement.\n5.  Put the pinky down next--on its side, not the fleshy part--and face towards the\nend of the E-flat key by using the outside of the pinky.  The pinky should be\ncurved like a question mark or a hook.  When this is correct, then have\nstudents  perform  the  “V”  exercise.\n6.  Place the thumb.  Have students gently pinch a table or music stand, and then\nrelate that to the flute.  The thumb is placed somewhere between the first and\nsecond finger, where it is most natural.  The thumb needs to go on its side.\nThe thumb and pinky are connected by tendons.  If there is tension in one,\nthere will be tension in the other.  Raise the big knuckles up.  They should be\napproximately  level  with  the  keys.    Continuously  watch  for  “hitchhiker”\nthumbs.\n7.  The thumb and first finger of the right hand should point in the same\ndirection.  Continually  and  closely  watch  out  for  “hitchhiker”  thumbs,  which\nresult in the left hand fingers shifting in the wrong direction.\n8.  The right hand should never shift towards the lever Bb key; rather, it should\nbe shifted towards the Eb key.  The only time the right hand index finger will\never have contact with the lever Bb key is when that fingering is actually\nbeing used.\n9.  When the flute is lifted, move the arms from the elbows.  The shoulders are\nnot engaged, and the elbows remain in the natural position in relation to the\nshoulders.\n10. The wrist is either straight or slightly arched, but never bent toward the body\nof the flute.\n11. The part between the thumb and first finger should be soft and open.  They\nshould never touch.\n12. The middle finger will have more height/bend to it because it is a longer\nfinger, but it cannot hang over the edge.  The fingers have a slight curve, but\nthe tips of the fingers are flat.\n13. The right hand goes towards the flute, and should be parallel to the flute.\n14. The fingers of the right hand should float or hover over the keys at all times.\nStudents  should  “push”  down  the  keys  only  when  appropriate  for  the\nfingerings.  Be sure the palm of the hand is soft so no tension is felt or seen.\nLEFT HAND POSTION\n1.  With the flute in its upright position on the left knee and supported by the\nright hand already in its correct position, the left hand makes a light fist at the\nbarrel while the fingers are being placed.\n2.  Place the first finger on the second key—the skip one key and place the\nsecond and third fingers on the next two keys.\n3.  The pinky is placed on the G#/Ab key, and is curved and never leaves this\n“home  position.”  Watch for pinkies that disappear either under the flute or\nunder the G#/Ab key itself.\n4.  The  thumb  is  between  12:00  and  1:00  on  the  “thumb  Bb”  key.    The  thumb\nforms  a  “T”  with  the  body  of  the  flute.\n5.  The palm is close to the body of the flute under the index finger.  The index\nfinger should touch the body of the flute and not look angular as the pad of the\nfinger touches the key.  The back of the left hand should be perpendicular to\nthe  flute.    There  is  a  slight  “break”  in  its  shape.    This  can  be  achieved  by\nrocking the left hand towards your body.\n6.  The fingers of the left hand should float or hover over the keys at all times.\nStudents  should  “push”  down  the  keys  only  when appropriate for the\n7.  The big knuckle will go somewhere between the first and second physical\nkeys.\n8.  The fingers move from the big knuckles except for the index finger, which\nmoves from the second joint.\n9.  The tip of the thumb and the base of the thumb should be on the same side of\nthe flute.\n(cid:120)  As students get older and more advanced, the focus for finger movement is\nshifted from the big knuckles to where the finger tendons are attached to the\nwrist.\n(cid:120)  Be patient with progress towards absolute hand position.  It is best to have\n“double  jointed”  students  not  play  the  flute.\n(cid:120)  To teach independent finger motion, put the fingers on every key and lift each\nsingly.  Be sure all fingers move up and down, and not back and forth.  The\nsame part of the finger should touch the same place on the key every time.\n(cid:120)  When hand position has been correctly mastered, the balance points on the\nfully-assembled flute are:\n1.  Right hand thumb\n2.  Left hand index finger\n3.  Ledge of chin\n4.  Right hand pinky\nItems That Will Help Hand Position\n(cid:120)  Dr.  Scholl’s  Mole  Foam Padding\n(cid:120)  Bo Pep Thumb Guide for Right Hand\n(cid:120)  Bo Pep Thumb Guide for Left Hand\n(cid:120)  Dr.  Scholl’s  Corn Removers Ultra-Thin\n(cid:120)  Solexa Thumb Port\n(cid:120)  Prima Thumb Rest\n(cid:120)  Pencil Grips\nOBOE HAND POSITION\n1.  Place the right hand first, with the lower joint and bell supported by the leg.\nThe upper joint can be gently held by the left hand as you begin the awkward\nprocess of finding the correct place for every finger.\n2.  Place the fleshy finger pads over the keys first.  Without putting pressure on\nthe finger tips, be sure all holes are covered.\n3.  The hand will begin in a straight across angle, and will be in the “flat-C”\nposition.  Eventually,  as  with  the  clarinet,  they  will  slant  into  the  “V”  position.\n4.  Place the thumb on the thumb rest between the rest and the leg.  The thumb\nnail touches the rest.  Very little (preferably, no) flesh will touch the thumb\nrest.  The thumb joint must always be to the right of the thumb rest, never\nbehind it.\n5.  Turn the oboe out in front of the student like a spyglass and make sure there is\nopen space between the body of the oboe and the hand.\n6.  The pinky rests on the most comfortable home key it will use later in this\nprocess.\n7.  The middle finger will appear higher because it is longer than the other\nfingers.\n8.  The middle finger should be very close to perpendicular to the joint.\n9.  No part of any finger should touch any rod.\n10. Practice moving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.  Do not let\nthe other two knuckles move.  The finger pads should fall directly into the\nholes.  In the beginning the pinky can move up and down also.\n11. Lean the oboe back on the shoulder and look at the right hand fingers as you\ndo this.  While  doing  this,  the  left  hand  must  remain  in  its  proper  “baby”\nposition holding the upper joint.\n12. Saying  “squeeze….release”  for  finger  movement  will  help  the  fingers  move\nfrom  the  big  knuckles  and  understand  the  “timing”  of  fingers.\n13. Make sure to feel all parts of the keys with the finger pads.\n14. Do not include side keys in the initial hand position information.  When\nasked by students, tell them once the hands can move using the keys correctly,\nthey will be allowed to use the keys on the side.\nLEFT HAND POSITION\n1.  ALWAYS KEEP ONE HAND ON THE OBOE AT ALL TIMES.  NEVER\nSIMPLY LAY IT IN THE LAP.\n2.  Keep the thumb perpendicular to the back of the instrument.\n3.  The middle knuckle of the index finger is placed over one of the octave keys.\n4.  The fingers are slightly slanted downward.\n5.  Place the index, middle, and ring fingers on the keys with holes.\n6.  Beginners  can  have  “fly-away”  fingers  in the beginning as long as they fall\nback down to the correct rings.  Always feel the palm of the hands to check\nfor the softness of the fingers.  There are more bones in this area of the hand\nthan any other part of the body.  If the palm is soft, all other parts of the hand\nwill be as naturally soft as is possible.  The pinkies should have comfortable\n“home  keys”  they  touch  all  of  the  time  in  the  beginning  stages.\n7.  Be patient with progress toward absolute correct hand position.  It is best to\nhave  “double  jointed”  students  not  play  the  oboe.\n8.  The body of the oboe is very small.  Hand position can feel very awkward.\nThe  student  should  be  made  aware  of  the  oboe’s  double octave key system,\nand that the middle finger will appear higher because it is longer than the\nother fingers.\n10. Using  the  previously  mentioned  “squeeze….release”  exercises,  practice\nmoving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.  Do not let the other\ntwo knuckles move.  The finger pads should fall directly into the holes.  In the\nbeginning the pinky can move up and down also.\n11. Make sure to feel all parts of the keys with the finger pads.\n12. Do not include side keys in the initial hand position information.  When\nasked, tell students once their hands can move using the keys correctly, they\nwill be allowed to use the keys on the side.\nBASSOON-BALANCING THE BASSOON/\nHAND POSITION\n(cid:120)  Place the seat strap across the FRONT of the chair. Make sure that the cup or\nhook of the seat strap is on the right side.\n(cid:120)  Sit towards the back of the chair while holding the instrument. Make sure the\nright side of the body is aligned with the right side of the chair.\n(cid:120)  Look for an indentation on the base of the spine above the belt line.\n(cid:120)  The height of the student should be maximized.\n(cid:120)  Assuming  the  student’s  posture  is  correct,  the  shoulder  blades  should  be  even\n(level) across the back.\n(cid:120)  Do not let the students distort their torso.\n(cid:120)  Hook the instrument to the seat strap and adjust the strap until the bocal is\nentering straight into the mouths while seated in a relaxed position.\n(cid:120)  Place the left hand on the instrument, demonstrating the position of the fingers\non  the  tone  holes……and  with  the  thumb  on  the  wisper  key.  After  the  fingers\nhave been positioned in the correct place, become aware of where the bassoon\nis balanced on the index finger. Allow the right hand to loosely position over\nthe boot or on the crutch.\nIdeally, the weight of the instrument should be balanced by the body and not\nleaning too heavily on the left hand. Avoid holding the instrument at an angle\nlike a saxophone, because the weight of the instrument will cause the student\nto lean forward and the left hand will be strained under the pressure.\n(cid:120)  Once  the  teacher  is  comfortable  with  the  student’s  posture,  the  student  can\nwalk around the room holding the bassoon. Hold the seat strap in the right\nhand,  which  is  holding  the  boot  in  place…and  the  right  hand  should  hold  the\nwing/long joint.  The parts of the bassoon will not slip apart if students are\nholding it in this manner. This will furthermore allow students to become\nmore comfortable holding the bassoon.\nCLARINET HAND POSITION\n1.  Place the right hand first, with the lower joint supported by the leg.  The right\nhand lifts the instrument, and the placement is less difficult or complicated.\n2.  Place the fleshy finger pads over the silver rings first.  Without putting\npressure on the finger tips, feel the pads fall into the holes.\n3.  The hand will begin in a straight across angle, and will  be  in  the  “flat-C”\nposition…not  too  curved  and  not  too  straight.\nnail touches the rest. Very little (preferably, no) flesh will touch the thumb\n5.  Turn the clarinet out in front of the student like a spyglass and make sure there\nis open space between the body of the clarinet and the hand.\n6.  The pinky rests on the most comfortable of the four keys it will use later in\nthis process (either key #1, which is the low F key—or key #2, which is the\nlow G#/Ab key).  The pinky should not be straight; it needs to be curved.\nWatch for pinkies that disappear either under the clarinet or under the pinky\n8.  No part of any finger should touch any rod.\n9.  Practice moving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.  Do not let\n10. Lean the clarinet back on the left shoulder and look at the right hand fingers as\nyou do this.  While doing this, the left hand must  remain  in  its  proper  “baby\nposition” holding the upper joint.\n11. Make sure to feel all parts of the ring with the finger pads.\n12. Keep the right hand straight across the body of the clarinet for at least 6 to 8\nweeks before moving into the more correct angled position.  This makes it\neasier for the ring finger and pinky to function more comfortably.\n13. Do not include side keys in the initial hand position information.  If asked, tell\nthem once the hands can move correctly using the rings and tone holes, they\nwill be allowed to learn to use the keys on the side.\nLEFT HAND POSITION  *critical and paramount to the success of playing\nthe clarinet\n1.  While holding the lower joint gently (not using correct hand position but the\nproper  “baby”  position) with the right hand as it rests on the leg, place the\nmiddle knuckle of the index finger on the G# key at the top of the upper joint.\nPlace the first knuckle on the A key with the fleshy part of the tip angled\ndown toward the first silver ring.  The teacher will have to identify these\n“named  keys”  for  the  student.\n2.  Place the middle finger over the second silver ring.\n3.  Place the ring finger over the third hole with no silver ring.\n4.  Place the thumb over the ring on the back of the upper joint with the fleshy\npart of the end being aware of the long, skinny key (register key).  The angle\nof  the  thumb  should  be  at  “1:00/2:00.”\n5.  The pinky will rest on the most comfortable of the four keys it will use later in\nthis process (either key #1, which is the low E key—or key #4, which is the\nlow C# key). The pinky should not be straight; it needs to be curved.  Watch\nfor pinkies that disappear either under the clarinet or under the pinky keys.\n6.  Keep the hand  in  an  adjusted  “flat-C”  position  and  the  wrist  slightly  up.    The\nwrist must stay in line with the rest of the forearm.\n7.  Continue to rest the clarinet on the leg and watch to see if the left hand\nfollows the line of the upper joint to form the angle of  a  “V”  with  the  upper\njoint.\n8.  Do not allow the knuckles of the index finger to lose contact with the G# and\nA keys.  For example, A should not be played without the index finger also\ntouching (not pressing) the G#/Ab key.\n9.  If the thumb is not being used to play specific sounds on the instrument it\nMUST NOT touch the body (wood) of the instrument.\n10. ALWAYS KEEP ONE HAND ON THE CLARINET AT ALL TIMES.\nNEVER SIMPLY LAY IT IN THE LAP.\n11. Beginners  can  have  “fly-away”  fingers  in  the  beginning  as  long  as  they  fall\nback down to the correct rings.  The exception is the left index finger.  If we\ntry  to  get  them  to  keep  their  fingers  in  the  “finished”  position  too  soon,  the\nhands can become too tense.  Always feel the palm of the hands to check for\nthe softness of the fingers.  There are more bones in this area of the hand than\nany other part of the body.  If the palm is soft, all other parts of the hand will\nbe as naturally soft as is possible.  The pinkies should have comfortable\n12. Beginning clarinet hand position is very awkward, thus taking longer to\nachieve and more patience from the teacher and student is required.  Do not\nget in a hurry.\nSAXOPHONE HAND POSITION\n1.  Always place the right hand first.\n2.  The second knuckle of the thumb should be placed under the right edge of the\nthumb rest.\n3.  Fingers should be placed on the pearls. The fleshy part will touch the pearls.\n4.  The pinky rests on the most comfortable of the two roller keys it will use later\nin this process (either the higher key, which is the low Eb key—or the lower\nkey, which is the low C key).  The pinky should not be straight; it needs to be\ncurved.  Watch for pinkies that disappear either under the saxophone or under\nthe pinky keys.\n5.  Fingers should be curved and round—not flat.\n6.  The wrist must stay in line with the rest of the forearm.  The wrist should not\ncollapse into the side keys.\n7.  Practice moving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.  Do not let\nthe other two knuckles move.  The finger pads should stay on the pearls at all\ntimes. In the beginning the pinky can move up and down also.\n8.  Do not include side keys in the initial hand position information.  If asked, tell\n1.  The left thumb rests on the back thumb rest and never leaves.  The second\n2.  Place the index finger on the first pearl.  The Yamaha YAS-23 and other\nbrands feature an extra pearl, or  “teardrop  key” which will need to be skipped.\n3.  Skip the small pearl (bis key).\n4.  Place the middle and ring finger on the next two pearls.  The finger pads\nshould stay on the pearls at all times.\n5.  The pinky should  rest  on  the  “home  key,”  which  is  the  G#/Ab  key.    The  pinky\nshould not be straight; it needs to be curved.  Watch for pinkies that disappear\neither under the saxophone or under the pinky keys.\n6.  Fingers should remain on the pearls and be curved and round, and not ever go\npast the pearls (resulting in flat fingers).\n7.  Keep  the  hand  in  an  adjusted  “flat-C”  position and the wrist slightly up.  The\n8.  Always feel the palm of the hands to check for the softness of the fingers.\nThere are more bones in this area of the hand than any other part of the body.\nIf the palm is soft, all other parts of the hand will be as naturally soft as is\npossible.  The pinkies should  have  comfortable  “home  keys”  they  touch  all  of\nthe time in the beginning stages.\nTRUMPET HAND POSITION\n1.  The most natural shape of everyone’s  hands  forms  a  “flat-C.”\n2.  All hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall\nbehind the wrist.\n3.  There should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the trumpet.\n4.  The inside of the arm must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when\nholding the trumpet correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\n5.  Elbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be\n6.  Place both the left and the right hand in their correct position.  Remember the\nleft  hand  does  not  “grip”  the  instrument.    No  tension  should  be  felt  in  this\nhand when holding the instrument.\n7.  The right thumb is placed in its natural position, which is between the first and\nsecond valve casing.  The thumb must never bend in any direction!  The\nindex, middle and ring fingers are curved and the fleshy part of the fingertips\nis placed on the pearls of the valve caps and should never lose contact with the\ncaps.    The  pinky  is  slightly  curved  and  placed  on  TOP  of  the  “ring.”    This\npinky should  never  be  placed  INSIDE  the  “ring”,  as  this  will  cause  students  to\n“pull”  the  instrument  into  their  embouchure  and  cause  major  problems.\n8.  Though not a part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are\npulling the instrument  toward  the  student’s  face.    Instruct  students  to  keep\ntheir elbows soft while playing the trumpet.\n9.  The palms of both hands should feel soft.  The palm of the right hand should\nnever touch the instrument.  The teacher should be able to clearly see a\n“circular”  opening  between  the  right  hand  and  the  instrument.\n10. The student should understand that finger movement is aided by the soft tissue\nof the palm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand.\nFRENCH HORN HAND POSITION\n1.  The  most  natural  shape  of  everyone’s  hands  forms  a  “flat-C.”\n2.  All hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall behind\nthe wrist.\n3.  There should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the French horn.\nholding the French horn correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\n6.  Place both the  left  and  the  right  hand  in  their  correct  “beginner”  position.    The  left\nhand is placed on the valves  and  will  lie  in  the  “flat-C”  position.    No  tension\nshould  be  felt  in  this  hand,  as  the  fingers  move  “with”  the  valves.\n7.  The right hand will be cupped on the outer ridge of the bottom of the bell.  Both\nhands hold and balance the French horn in the beginning.  The horn does not rest\non the leg.  The right hand is not placed inside the bell until the teacher\ndetermines that the student can balance the horn in this manner.  An added bonus\nto holding the French horn by the bottom of the bell will result in the student\nbeing able to hear—and expect to hear—a more resonant sound when the hand is\nfinally in its correct/more advanced position inside the bell.\npulling  the  instrument  toward  the  student’s  face.    Instruct  students  to  keep  their\nelbows soft while playing the French horn.\n9.  The palms of both hands should feel soft.\n10. The teacher must watch young students closely to monitor that their shoulders\nstay balanced and feel naturally soft at all times.\n(cid:120)  Although single F horns are lighter and easier for students to control in the\nbeginning stages of playing, it is suggested that beginning French horn\nstudents are started on double horns. Of course, this decision may be\ndictated by what instruments are available in your inventory.\nTROMBONE HAND POSITION\n1.  With  the  left  hand,  form  an  “L”  or  a  gun.    Have  the  student  wrap  the  bottom  three\nfingers around the left brace of the slide while the thumb wraps around the brace\nof the bell.  The index finger should lie relaxed on top of the upper brace slide.\n2.  The thick pads of the left hand should never overlap to the outer slide.  Students\nwill  “clip”  their  hands  when  moving  the  slide.    This  is  the  most  common  beginner\n“injury,”  and  it  can  be  easily  avoided.\n3.  The right hand should hold the slide with the fleshy part of the index and middle\nfingers  and  thumb  (“two  fingers  and  a  thumb”).\n4.  Bring the instrument to the face.  Though not a part of the hand, the elbows must\nnever  feel  as  though  they  are  pulling  the  instrument  toward  the  student’s  face.\nInstruct students to keep their elbows soft while playing the trombone.\n5.  An  “X”  should  form  between  the  left  and right arms and elbows should be on the\nsame plane when holding the instrument correctly.\n6.  Both hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall\n7.  There should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the trombone.\n8.  The inside of the arm must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when\nholding the trombone correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\n9.  Elbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be\n10. Remember, the  left  hand  does  not  “grip”  the  instrument.    No  tension  should  be\nfelt in this hand when holding the instrument.\n11. The palms of both hands should feel soft.  The palm of the right hand should\nnever touch the instrument.  The teacher should be able to clearly  see  a  “circular”\nopening between the right hand and the slide.\n12. The student should understand that slide movement is aided by the soft tissue of\nthe palm of the hand, rather than the bony texture on the top of the hand.\n13. The trombone is the most awkward instrument to hold out of all brass\ninstruments, and students should constantly be reminded to keep a calm mind and\na calm body.  Take frequent breaks so that students can build endurance when\nlearning how to hold the instrument to avoid bad habits from forming."

They will have to later remember and memorize how it looks and feels.\nThe head must be balanced on the shoulders in a comfortable position – not too far forward and not too far backward.\nThe eyes should be soft and natural and the “sight line” should be exactly level. The distance between eyebrows should not change as air goes in and out of the body.\nLook for natural creases in the face, and allow any that are naturally present to exist while playing. No other creases are allowed.\nThe corners should move in toward the canine teeth. The corners should never look or feel pulled back.\nThe corners can move down from the natural position as the student progresses, but they can never move up.\nThe texture of both the upper and lower lip should be very soft and relaxed.\nThere should be natural space between the inside of the lips and the gums and teeth. This space should not change or feel different when the lips vibrate inside the cup of the mouthpiece.\nThe back teeth are slightly apart and should feel the same as when the student is reading, watching television, etc. The teeth should not be pressed into each other when doing these other activities.\nBrass instrument embouchures are formed with natural overbite. A student with an underbite should be steered away from brass instruments.\nThe thickness of a student’s lips should correspond to the size of the cup of the mouthpiece for the chosen instrument. Students with a very thin top or bottom lip should be steered towards high brass instruments rather than trombone.\nThe bottom of the front of the tongue should lie in the soft tissue area which is located in the front of the mouth just behind the ridge of the bottom gum.\nRemember that when playing the trombone, cheeks will only “puff out” if the air is not freely going into the instrument. This should be avoided!\nAssuming that the above has been achieved, the embouchure will be formed with special attention to the following:\nThe mouthpiece must be placed in the middle of the mouth – up and down as well as side to side.\nThe corners are in their natural position and should be set against the canine teeth.\nThe lips must be allowed to freely vibrate in response to the airstream rather than made to “buzz” in front of the airstream.\nThe lips must feel natural so that air can freely move past them – they must not be pulled back against the teeth or blown away from the teeth and gums.\nThe students should remember that the mouthpiece “gathers” the air – not the lips.\nThere must never be more energy placed against the upper lip than the lower lip; hence the mouthpiece (and the instrument) will angle slightly downwards."

A poorly maintained trombone can start deteriorating in quality in as little as 5 years.\nIt is suggested that the slide be cleaned at least every 7-10 days. If the trombone is going to be “put away” for an extended amount of time, it needs to be cleaned beforehand to minimize the moisture trapped inside the instrument while not in use.\nMaterials needed:\nCleaning rod\nCheesecloth\nGlass cleaner or mild soap and water\nTrombotine, Yamaha Slide Lubricant, or Slide-O-Mix\nSpray bottle filled with water\nInsert at least a yard-length of cheesecloth through the eye of your cleaning rod. Wrap a small amount of cheesecloth around the tip of the cleaning rod to avoid damage if it hits the crook of the slide. Wrap the remainder of the cheesecloth around the length of the cleaning rod. One should have enough cheesecloth to hold onto as it inserts the slide so it does not get “lost” in the slide and become difficult to remove.\nInsert the cleaning rod and cheesecloth into the outer slide. Be careful not to hit the crook of the slide as it is entering. Move the cleaning rod in and out of the outer slide, creating friction as the cleaning rod moves. The friction breaks up the chemical bonds that hold the left-over slide lubricant in the slide.\nRepeat in the opposite end of the slide.\nThe same process should be used for the inner slide, but extreme care should be taken as the inner slide is the most fragile part of the entire instrument.\nAfter this process is complete, the cheesecloth should be disposed of.\nTake glass cleaner (or a mild soapy water solution) and gently clean the exterior of the inner slide. This will remove any residue left from previous applications of slide lubricant. Please note that the inner slide is plated nickel -- not silver -- therefore silver polish should not be used to clean it.\nOnce the inner slide is clean, apply the slide lubricant.\nYamaha Trombone Slide Lubricant\nApply evenly over both prongs of the inner slide.\nSpray with water.\nNo “working in” is necessary.\nSlide-O-Mix\nApply a drop from the small flask at the stockings (wide end) of the inner slide. Distribute evenly by putting on the outer slide and moving it up and down several times.\nApply liquid from the larger bottle at the top of the inner slide and let it trickle down the length of the slide. Once again, use the outer slide to help evenly distribute the lubricant.\nTrombotine (standard in most classrooms)\nApply a pea-sized amount of lubricant to the stocking (wide end) of the slide.\nBegin by working the lubricant into the stocking of the slide, and work your way up to the rest of the slide. Since the stocking is the wider part, it will have the most contact with the outer slide; it is therefore crucial that it is well-lubricated.\nThe Trombotine should form a thin (nearly invisible) layer over the inner slide.\nRepeat on the second prong of the inner slide.\nTrombotine can often act like a reed in the fact that it works in “cycles.” It can take 2-3 days to “break in” and feel most effective. Once this point has been reached, it will be at its best for about 7 days; then, it will deteriorate for 2-3 days, by which time the slide needs to be cleaned and re-lubricated."

Consider mouthpieces from companies such as Griego, Greg Black, Doug Elliott, Schilke and more.\nTROMBONE MOUTHPIECE INFORMATION\nFactors to consider when looking at a mouthpiece\nRim width\nCup depth\nShank size/back bore\nPlating\nBasic terminology\nBore size refers to the instrument one is playing, not the mouthpiece. The bore size is the inside diameter of the lead pipe. Small bore trombones are typically .500- inch and large bore trombones are typically .547-inch.\nSmall shank mouthpieces refer to mouthpieces that can fit on a straight trombone or small bore euphonium.\nLarge shank mouthpieces refer to mouthpieces that can fit on trombone with large bores (typically, those with secondary attachments) and euphoniums with large bores.\nMouthpiece adapters are made for people playing on small shank mouthpieces to play on a large bore instrument. Do not use mouthpiece adapters, if possible – try to play on small shank mouthpieces for small bore instruments and large shank mouthpieces for large bore instruments. This is to maintain the integrity of the proportions that the instruments were designed to sound best on.\nSilver vs. gold plating\nThere has been much controversy surrounding the issue of playing on silver-plated or gold-plated mouthpieces. These include the following:\nEndurance\nTone quality\nEase of playing\nOverall embouchure health\nSo what is the truth? Because the embouchure is incredibly personal and can only be truly determined and developed on an individual level, the issue, as a whole, does not really matter. Students will discover what works best for them as they develop, and they should only do so under the supervision of an experienced band director and/or private lesson instructor.\nIt is recommended to start beginners on a silver mouthpiece. A silver mouthpiece is cheaper, and because it is uncertain whether or not the student will have embouchure issues on the onset, there is no need to have students start on a gold mouthpiece (which is twice as expensive)."

    "text": "TROMBONE FLEXIBILITY AND RANGE EXTENSION\nBrass playing is based upon flexibility.\nThere are two types of flexibility: flexibility within the instrument and flexibility within the note.\nStudents eventually need to be flexible through each of the harmonic series in order to move up and down within the range of the instrument.\nOnce the student can reproduce at will a given pitch, the teacher must decide whether flexibility up or down is needed first.\nFlexibility is controlled by air direction and the isometrics created by the corners and canine/eye teeth.  The head must always stay in its natural, balanced position at all times.  The angle of the instrument must not change at any time.\nStudents must learn to angle the air in the cup of the mouthpiece without changing the position of the lips and/or the relationship of the upper and lower teeth.\nFlexibility is also enhanced by vowel sounds used in various registers.  These sounds can be “ah” for the middle register….”ee” for the upper register….and “oh” for the lower register.  Have students practice saying these vowel sounds with vocalization on appropriate lower, middle and higher sounds.\nThe speed of the air and the shape of the vowel guide flexibility.  The tongue assists the air speed similar to the way one’s thumb assists the water speed from a hose.  The tongue relaxes when descending into the lower register and arches when ascending into the upper register.\nBring to the students’ attention that the shape of the tongue changes dramatically from vowel sound to vowel sound.  All students should be aware that vowel sounds are the middles of words that they speak every day.  Practice saying words that use the required vowel sounds. (i.e.  bow, ball, beep)\nRange is developed through flexibility.  It is more important to create a resonant sound while practicing flexibility than to create wider intervals.  The student can enhance their range by making more resonant sounds in the middle register before trying to extend higher or lower.\nWhile it is important to create resonant sounds in the register students can play in, it is important for students to occasionally try exploring both the upper and lower range they struggle to make a good sound in.  This should be practiced perhaps twice a week.\nMake sure students understand the texture of the lips have nothing to do with range. For example, students should never be told to “tighten” their lips in order to play in the higher register."

Many trombone players do not begin to learn alto trombone until they are college music majors, and many of the literature played in high school orchestras can be played on the tenor trombone. You are not recommended having students playing alto trombone in a public school setting.\nTenor Trombone\nMost common instrument in public schools for middle school/junior high and high school (with F attachment)\nTERMINOLOGY ABOUT ATTACHMENTS FOR TROMBONE\nOpen wrap attachments have tubing that extends past the main tuning slide and only has one curve in it. The open wrap attachment is preferred as there are less bends in the tubing, allowing the airflow to be less restricted.\nClosed wrap attachments (also known as “traditional” wraps) are curved with all of the tubing fitting inside the main tuning slide.\n“Straight” horns are horns that do not have attachments. These would typically be the small bore horns on which most beginners will start.\nAttachments Relating to Specific Instruments\nThe alto trombone can have an attachment (typically a Bb rotary valve attachment) but it is not totally necessary. The attachment simply makes playing the instrument easier.\nThe F-attachment on tenor trombone allows the trombonist to reach notes not available on the small bore “straight’ horn. Most specifically, these notes are in the lower register (Eb below the staff to C below the staff), which are typically played by the bass trombone anyway.\nBass Trombone\nThe bass trombone typically has two attachments and, thus, two triggers; these are generally F/Gb and D/Db attachments.\nThese attachments allow for lower notes to be played that cannot necessarily be played with ease on the tenor trombone.\nTypes of Valves\nRotary\nStandard design on most F-attachments\nAttempts to emulate European style of trumpet playing\nThayer valve\nConically shaped\nSmoother transitions\nMore open sound\nThe bass trombone is a color instrument; it does not sound an octave lower than the trombone, but rather, there is a distinct, timbral difference between the two instruments.\nThe bass trombone has a rounder, fuller sound than the tenor trombone, and in the lower register, an amount of controlled edge can produce a variety of effects for the ensemble.\nRequires a slightly larger mouthpiece than tenor trombone\nShould only be played by mature players in a high school ensemble. Middle school/junior high students should not be playing the instrument because it is too challenging given the physical and mental development of students in that age group.\nContrabass Trombone\nPitched in Bb; reads in concert pitch (non-transposing)\nNot much different from the bass trombone other than it has a double slide, which allows the instrument to play lower with more ease than the bass trombone\nNot to be used in a middle school/junior high or high school band, as it is rarely used outside of a professional ensemble (much less in a professional ensemble!)\nValve Trombone\nPitched in Bb\nIt is shaped like a trombone but has valves where a slide should be; in other words, it is the platypus of the trombone family.\nBasically was developed for European polka bands and early American military bands, but the most common use today is a bass version known as the cimbasso, which is typically played by tuba players on a tuba mouthpiece in operatic works by Verdi and Puccini.\nNot to be used in a middle school/junior high or high school band, as it is a novelty instrument"

    "text": "TROMBONE CASES, IDENTIFICATION OF PARTS AND REMOVING IT FROM ITS CASE\nGeneral Information About All Brass Cases\nMost cases have distinguishing marks somewhere on the case.  Identify these marks, and their relationship to the top and bottom of the case.  Most cases have the handles placed on the bottom section of each case.  Check to make sure.\nPlace all euphonium cases on the floor in front of the student.\nBe sure the student understands where and which direction each part of the instrument belongs in the case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make sure the student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure the parts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse order they were removed.\nThe trombone should be removed first, followed by the mouthpiece.  When putting instrument back, the order is reversed – mouthpiece first, followed by the trombone.\nAll instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure explicitly every time.\nNever leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up, but this is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.  Check each opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to your students.\nCases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom setup for each student’s case.  If using an ensemble room for the class, the cases may be opened in the hall.  The empty case will remain closed and latched in the hall during class.\nWhen instruments are in their cases, do not allow students to sit on their cases AT ANY TIME because the lead pipe, bell, and/or slide will get bent or damaged.\nAssembly of the Trombone\nPlace the case on the floor. Most latches on trombone cases face up.\nOpen the case, and make sure that both parts of the horn – as well as the mouthpiece compartment – are secure.\nBefore removing the slide from the case, make sure the slide lock is on.\nUnlatch and remove the slide from the case with the right hand. The palm will face down on the slide bars.\nTip the slide immediately towards the floor, making the slide parallel with the body and with the large end facing inward. The endpin on the slide should touch the ground. The slide will remain stationary for the remainder of the assembly process.\nUnlatch and remove the bell from the case. The palm will face down near the bell brace. Lift with the bell down and the counterweight up so that the bell is parallel with the body.\nThe bell will move toward the slide at the docking station. Tilting slightly away from the slide, the bell will rest down on top of the slide. Do not secure the bell to the slide until the correct angle has been set.\nTo set the correct angle, have the student stand up and look down towards the trombone. Remember – the slide is not a crutch and the student should never lean on the trombone, especially when it has not been secured.\nThe angle should be 180 degrees and should read like a clock at “2:45”.\nSlowly move the bell until the clock reads “3:00”. Then, move an additional five minutes to “3:05”.\nSecure the bell and the slide at the docking station until the first point of resistance.\nHolding the trombone in the left hand, carefully remove the mouthpiece with the right hand.\nSeat the mouthpiece gently into the lead pipe, and rotate 2/3 of a turn for a friction grip.\nPARTS OF THE TROMBONE"

    "text": "TROMBONE INSTRUMENT/BODY RATIO AND HAND POSITION\nInstrument/Body Ratio/Instrument Carriage\nAssuming that the student is either standing or sitting with correct posture, instruct them to pick up the body of the trombone with both hands and simply lift it by using their arms.  Move the instrument up and down, side to side, higher than usual and lower than usual.  As students are doing this, have them notice how it affects the balance of the body.  Eventually, the body should feel as balanced with or without the instrument in hand.\nMake sure students bring instruments to them… and not them to the instruments.  When done incorrectly, their body collapses and their air is obstructed.\nShoulders should be straight across when facing the director and it should feel the same way when doing breathing exercises  (do not twist or shift the upper body out of the breathing position)\nThe trombone should not be slanted in a manner in which moves the students’ head from its natural position.\nAngles of mouthpieces should be slightly lower than level.\nHand Position\nWith the left hand, form an “L”. Have the student wrap the bottom three fingers around the left brace of the slide while the thumb wraps around the brace of the bell. The index finger should lie relaxed on top of the upper slide brace.\nThe thick pads of the left hand should never overlap to the outer slide. Students will “clip” their hands when moving the slide. This is the most common beginner “injury,” and it can easily be avoided.\nThe right hand should hold the slide with fleshy part of the index and middle fingers and the thumb (“two fingers and a thumb”).\nBring the instrument to the face. Though not part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling the instrument toward the student’s face. Instruct students to keep their elbows soft while playing the trombone.\nAn “X” should form between the left and right arms and elbows should be on the same plane when holding the instrument correctly.\nBoth hands will fall in from the wrists. The body of the hand must never fall behind the wrist.\nThere should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the trombone.\nThe inside of the arm must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding the trombone correctly. No body part touches another body part!\nElbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be hampered.\nRemember, the left hand does not “grip” the instrument. No tension should be felt in this hand when holding the instrument.\nThe palms of both hands should feel soft. The palm of the right hand should never touch the instrument. The teacher should be able to clearly see a “circular” opening between the right hand and the slide.\nThe student should understand that slide movement is aided by the soft tissue of the palm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand.\nThe trombone is the most awkward instrument to hold out of all brass instruments, and students should be constantly reminded to keep a calm mind and a calm body. Take frequent breaks so that students can build endurance when learning how to hold the instrument to avoid bad habits from forming."

    "text": "TROMBONE ARTICULATION\nThe tongue moves in the same manner when articulating a brass instrument as it does when you speak.  The tongue moves up and down—not back and forth—both when speaking and when articulation on an instrument.\nThe purpose of the tongue is to release the air which causes the lips to vibrate and creates the sound.  The tongue’s release of the air simply defines the beginning/start of the vibration/sound.\nArticulation is used to define the vibrations necessary to create musical rhythm, style and movement--to contrast the use of slurring (which also creates similar musical entities).\nThe students should think that the tongue “articulates” the sound created by the airstream.  If the student is taught to create the sound correctly, articulation will be an easy transition.\nsound occurs when the air moves past the naturally vibrating lips\narticulate the sound that is already present\nteach students to articulate at the moment the sound begins\nWithout the instrument or mouthpiece, use the following procedure:\nSay the word “DOG”.\nSing the syllable “DAH”.\nOnce these are mastered, have the student use the mouthpiece and instrument and reproduce the “DAH” syllable in their brain to create an articulated sound.\nThe tongue should feel the same when saying, singing and playing the mouthpiece and instrument.\nThe tongue should touch the enamel of the upper teeth directly below the gum line—in the same spot with the same strength every time.\nUse the syllable “DAH” because it creates smoother and more easily controlled air as opposed to the “TAH” syllable.\nAfter each “articulation”, the tongue must immediately fall down into its natural “at rest” position.\nThe tongue will be naturally soft at all times, but can touch the teeth with different strengths.\nThe tongue will be in its “down position” 98% of the time when articulating correctly.\nHave the student start their sound with the air.\nUsing the information about the basics of articulation, have the student articulate as fast as they can with no limitations of numbers, worries about evenness of articulation, etc.  Simply get the students used to articulating!\nHave the student then use the “ta-day” syllable to practice using the tongue in an organized manner.\nHave the student then articulate “on command.”  The student will start their sound, and articulate when you snap your fingers to practice gaining more control of the tongue.\nOnce the student understands pulse and the foot pat, have the student articulate exactly when the toe of the foot touches the floor.\nHave the student articulate with the down and up position of the foot.\nProceed to written rhythms as students begin to read music.\nAlways practice this entire routine.  The student must always go through the entire process, so he will not lose the ability to move his tongue at various speeds and in a structured manner.\nSLURRING ON THE TROMBONE\nSlurs can occur in 4 forms:\nLip Slur\nNo tongue\nSame position\nNatural Slur\nDifferent positions\nValve slur\nSame or different positions\nLegato slur\nLegato tongue\nThe only slur that requires a tongue-start is a legato slur. Legato slurs occur between notes that are on the same harmonic/partial. Notes on the same partial can cause a “glissando” and the legato slur is used to prevent that “smear” effect.\nLegato slurs require:\nA soft legato syllable, “dah” or “doo,” that brushes very lightly (think 3 taste buds)\nThe tongue brushes on the ridge above the teeth; the legato tongue does not touch enamel.\nThe tongue must move away quickly to prevent compression of the air.\nThe tongue must be synchronized with an efficient slide movement.\nIf beginning students are taught to slur correctly from the onset, the students will be ahead of the game when transitioning through middle school/junior high. Apart from correct slide positions, slurring on trombone is perhaps the most neglected aspect of playing by both young and experienced teachers; therefore, it is vital that students are set up for success by instilling proper habits from the beginning!"

Many trombone players do not begin to learn alto trombone until they are college music majors, and many of the literature played in high school orchestras can be played on the tenor trombone. You are not recommended having students playing alto trombone in a public school setting.\nTenor Trombone\nMost common instrument in public schools for middle school/junior high and high school (with F attachment)\nTERMINOLOGY ABOUT ATTACHMENTS FOR TROMBONE\nOpen wrap attachments have tubing that extends past the main tuning slide and only has one curve in it. The open wrap attachment is preferred as there are less bends in the tubing, allowing the airflow to be less restricted.\nClosed wrap attachments (also known as “traditional” wraps) are curved with all of the tubing fitting inside the main tuning slide.\n“Straight” horns are horns that do not have attachments. These would typically be the small bore horns on which most beginners will start.\nAttachments Relating to Specific Instruments\nThe alto trombone can have an attachment (typically a Bb rotary valve attachment) but it is not totally necessary. The attachment simply makes playing the instrument easier.\nThe F-attachment on tenor trombone allows the trombonist to reach notes not available on the small bore “straight’ horn. Most specifically, these notes are in the lower register (Eb below the staff to C below the staff), which are typically played by the bass trombone anyway.\nBass Trombone\nThe bass trombone typically has two attachments and, thus, two triggers; these are generally F/Gb and D/Db attachments.\nThese attachments allow for lower notes to be played that cannot necessarily be played with ease on the tenor trombone.\nTypes of Valves\nRotary\nStandard design on most F-attachments\nAttempts to emulate European style of trumpet playing\nThayer valve\nConically shaped\nSmoother transitions\nMore open sound\nThe bass trombone is a color instrument; it does not sound an octave lower than the trombone, but rather, there is a distinct, timbral difference between the two instruments.\nThe bass trombone has a rounder, fuller sound than the tenor trombone, and in the lower register, an amount of controlled edge can produce a variety of effects for the ensemble.\nRequires a slightly larger mouthpiece than tenor trombone\nShould only be played by mature players in a high school ensemble. Middle school/junior high students should not be playing the instrument because it is too challenging given the physical and mental development of students in that age group.\nContrabass Trombone\nPitched in Bb; reads in concert pitch (non-transposing)\nNot much different from the bass trombone other than it has a double slide, which allows the instrument to play lower with more ease than the bass trombone\nNot to be used in a middle school/junior high or high school band, as it is rarely used outside of a professional ensemble (much less in a professional ensemble!)\nValve Trombone\nPitched in Bb\nIt is shaped like a trombone but has valves where a slide should be; in other words, it is the platypus of the trombone family.\nBasically was developed for European polka bands and early American military bands, but the most common use today is a bass version known as the cimbasso, which is typically played by tuba players on a tuba mouthpiece in operatic works by Verdi and Puccini.\nNot to be used in a middle school/junior high or high school band, as it is a novelty instrument\nRECOMMENDED TROMBONE BRANDS\nBeginner:\nBrand: Yamaha\nModel: YSL-345\nPricing: MSRP $1,197.00 – wwbw.com\nDescription\nPreferred beginner instrument\nMade with quality material comparable to Yamaha professional trombones\nBrand: Bach\nModel: TB300\nPricing: MSRP $540.00 – wwbw.com\nGood beginner trombone\nLighter weight\nLess expensive\nInformation Regarding Students “Stepping-Up” To A Professional Trombone\nConsidering that most students use a rent-to-own trombone during their beginner year, it is highly recommended that students “step-up” to a professional/trigger trombone within the next 2-3 years.\nAssuming that students stay in band until high school, one could use their beginner trombone for marching band; however, as stated previously, students are strongly encouraged to “step-up”.\nProfessional:\nModel: 42BO\nPricing: MSRP $4,603.00 – wwbw.com\nStandard trombone for intermediate players\nNot uncommon in the professional world\nOpen-wrap and rotary valve help create a more consistent tone in the trigger register\nBach trombones tend to be inconsistent from one instrument to another.\nBrand: Conn\nModel: 88H\nPricing: MSRP $3,997.00 – wwbw.com\nGood professional trombone\nClosed-wrap design\nVERY old design by Conn-Selmer\nBrand: Eastman by Shires\nModel: ETB630\nPricing: MSRP $2,360.00 – dillonmusic.com\nCustom-built trombone\nShires is one of the leading trombone brands in the world.\nShires is well liked for their ability to customize instruments for each individual player.\nUses an axial-flow valve for a smoother transition into the lower register\nOpen-wrap\nComes with 3 interchangeable leadpipes\nBrand: Edwards\nModel: T350-E\nPricing: MSRP $3,700.00+ - available only through Edwards\nEdwards is another leading trombone brand.\nFull customization through Edwards is not uncommon\nOutstanding for orchestral-style playing\nAxial-flow valve\nVery consistent tone quality throughout the range of the instrument\nConsistent from one instrument to another\nModel: T398-A\nPricing: MSRP $4,700.00+ - Available only through Edwards\nJoseph Alessi model\nVersatile; suitable for orchestral and solo performance style of playing\nRotax Valve\nComes with “Harmonic Pillars” that are inserted into a brace that customizes the density of the instrument, thus affecting tone, articulation, etc.\nInformation Regarding Professional Trombones\nMany professional trombones are handcrafted and custom-made, so prices will vary.

Consider mouthpieces from companies such as Griego, Greg Black, Doug Elliott, Schilke and more.\nTROMBONE MOUTHPIECE INFORMATION\nFactors to consider when looking at a mouthpiece\nRim width\nCup depth\nShank size/back bore\nPlating\nBasic terminology\nBore size refers to the instrument one is playing, not the mouthpiece. The bore size is the inside diameter of the lead pipe. Small bore trombones are typically .500- inch and large bore trombones are typically .547-inch.\nSmall shank mouthpieces refer to mouthpieces that can fit on a straight trombone or small bore euphonium.\nLarge shank mouthpieces refer to mouthpieces that can fit on trombone with large bores (typically, those with secondary attachments) and euphoniums with large bores.\nMouthpiece adapters are made for people playing on small shank mouthpieces to play on a large bore instrument. Do not use mouthpiece adapters, if possible – try to play on small shank mouthpieces for small bore instruments and large shank mouthpieces for large bore instruments. This is to maintain the integrity of the proportions that the instruments were designed to sound best on.\nSilver vs. gold plating\nThere has been much controversy surrounding the issue of playing on silver-plated or gold-plated mouthpieces. These include the following:\nEndurance\nTone quality\nEase of playing\nOverall embouchure health\nSo what is the truth? Because the embouchure is incredibly personal and can only  be truly determined and developed on an individual level, the issue, as a whole, does not really matter. Students will discover what works best for them as they develop, and they should only do so under the supervision of an experienced band director and/or private lesson instructor.\nIt is recommended to start beginners on a silver mouthpiece. A silver mouthpiece is cheaper, and because it is uncertain whether or not the student will have embouchure issues on the onset, there is no need to have students start on a gold mouthpiece (which is twice as expensive).\nPARTS OF THE TROMBONE MOUTHPIECE\nTROMBONE MAINTENANCE KIT – RECOMMENDED ITEMS\nOR\nTROMBONE MAINTENANCE KIT – OPTIONAL RECOMMENDED ITEMS\nOne of the following music stands can be chosen depending on socio-economic environment, availability, or preference.\nTROMBONE METHOD BOOKS\nSUPPLEMENTAL TROMBONE BOOKS\nTROMBONE ASSEMBLY, HAND POSITION AND INSTRUMENT/BODY RATIO\nAssembly of the Trombone\nPlace the case on the floor. Most latches on trombone cases face up.\nOpen the case, and make sure that both parts of the horn – as well as the mouthpiece compartment – are secure.\nBefore removing the slide from the case, make sure the slide lock is on.\nUnlatch and remove the slide from the case with the right hand. The palm will face down on the slide bars.\nTip the slide immediately towards the floor, making the slide parallel with the body and with the large end facing inward. The endpin on the slide should touch the ground. The slide will remain stationary for the remainder of the assembly process.\nUnlatch and remove the bell from the case. The palm will face down near the bell brace. Lift with the bell down and the counterweight up so that the bell is parallel with the body.\nThe bell will move toward the slide at the docking station. Tilting slightly away from the slide, the bell will rest down on top of the slide. Do not secure the bell to the slide until the correct angle has been set.\nTo set the correct angle, have the student stand up and look down towards the trombone. Remember – the slide is not a crutch and the student should never lean on the trombone, especially when it has not been secured.\nThe angle should be 180 degrees and should read like a clock at “2:45”.\nSlowly move the bell until the clock reads “3:00”. Then, move an additional five minutes to “3:05”.\nSecure the bell and the slide at the docking station until the first point of resistance.\nHolding the trombone in the left hand, carefully remove the mouthpiece with the right hand.\nSeat the mouthpiece gently into the lead pipe, and rotate 2/3 of a turn for a friction grip.\nHand Position\nWith the left hand, form an “L”. Have the student wrap the bottom three fingers around the left brace of the slide while the thumb wraps around the brace of the bell. The index finger should lie relaxed on top of the upper slide brace.\nThe thick pads of the left hand should never overlap to the outer slide. Students will “clip” their hands when moving the slide. This is the most common beginner “injury,” and it can easily be avoided.\nThe right hand should hold the slide with fleshy part of the index and middle fingers and the thumb (“two fingers and a thumb”).\nBring the instrument to the face. Though not part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling the instrument toward the student’s face. Instruct students to keep their elbows soft while playing the trombone.\nAn “X” should form between the left and right arms and elbows should be on the same plane when holding the instrument correctly.\nAll hands will fall in from the wrists. The body of the hand must never fall behind the wrist.\nThere should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the trombone.\nThe inside of the arm must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding the trombone correctly. No body part touches another body part!\nElbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be hampered.\nRemember, the left hand does not “grip” the instrument. No tension should be felt in this hand when holding the instrument.\nThe palms of both hands should feel soft. The palm of the right hand should never touch the instrument. The teacher should be able to clearly see a “circular” opening between the right hand and the slide.\nThe student should understand that slide movement is aided by the soft tissue of the palm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand.\nThe trombone is the most awkward instrument to hold out of all brass instruments, and students should be constantly reminded to keep a calm mind and a calm body. Take frequent breaks so that students can build endurance when learning how to hold the instrument to avoid bad habits from forming.\nInstrument/Body Ratio\nAssuming that the student is either standing or sitting with correct posture, instruct them to pick up the body of the trombone with both hands and simply lift it by using their elbows. Move the instrument up and down, side to side, higher than usual and lower than usual. As students are doing this, have them notice how it affects the balance of the body. Eventually, the body should feel balanced with or without the instrument in hand.\nPARTS OF THE TROMBONE\nTROMBONE FACE/EMBOUCHURE\nEach student should use their own “safe/unbreakable” mirror – both in the classroom and at home.\nUsing the mirror, have each student notice how natural their face looks. They will have to later remember and memorize how it looks and feels.\nThe head must be balanced on the shoulders in a comfortable position – not too far forward and not too far backward.\nThe eyes should be soft and natural and the “sight line” should be exactly level. The distance between eyebrows should not change as air goes in and out of the body.\nLook for natural creases in the face, and allow any that are naturally present to exist while playing. No other creases are allowed.\nThe corners should move in toward the canine teeth. The corners should never look or feel pulled back.\nThe corners can move down from the natural position as the student progresses, but they can never move up.\nThe texture of both the upper and lower lip should be very soft and relaxed.\nThere should be natural space between the inside of the lips and the gums and teeth. This space should not change or feel different when the lips vibrate inside the cup of the mouthpiece.\nThe back teeth are slightly apart and should feel the same as when the student is reading, watching television, etc. The teeth should not be pressed into each other when doing these other activities.\nBrass instrument embouchures are formed with natural overbite. A student with an underbite should be steered away from brass instruments.\nThe thickness of a student’s lips should correspond to the size of the cup of the mouthpiece for the chosen instrument. Students with a very thin top or bottom lip should be steered towards high brass instruments rather than trombone.\nThe bottom of the front of the tongue should lie in the soft tissue area which is located in the front of the mouth just behind the ridge of the bottom gum.\nRemember that when playing the trombone, cheeks will only “puff out” if the air is not freely going into the instrument. This should be avoided!\nAssuming that the above has been achieved, the embouchure will be formed with special attention to the following:\nThe mouthpiece must be placed in the middle of the mouth – up and down as well as side to side.\nThe corners are in their natural position and should be set against the canine teeth.\nThe lips must be allowed to freely vibrate in response to the airstream rather than made to “buzz” in front of the airstream.\nThe lips must feel natural so that air can freely move past them – they must not be pulled back against the teeth or blown away from the teeth and gums.\nThe students should remember that the mouthpiece “gathers” the air – not the lips.\nThere must never be more energy placed against the upper lip than the lower lip; hence the mouthpiece (and the instrument) will angle slightly downwards.\nTROMBONE ARTICULATION\nThe tongue moves in the same manner when articulating a brass instrument as it does when you speak.  The tongue moves up and down—not back and forth—both when speaking and when articulation on an instrument.\nThe purpose of the tongue is to release the air which causes the lips to vibrate and creates the sound.  The tongue’s release of the air simply defines the beginning/start of the vibration/sound.\nArticulation is used to define the vibrations necessary to create musical rhythm, style and movement--to contrast the use of slurring (which also creates similar musical entities).\nThe students should think that the tongue “articulates” the sound created by the airstream.  If the student is taught to create the sound correctly, articulation will be an easy transition.\nsound occurs when the air moves past the naturally vibrating lips\narticulate the sound that is already present\nteach students to articulate at the moment the sound begins\nWithout the instrument or mouthpiece, use the following procedure:\nSay the word “DOG”.\nSing the syllable “DAH”.\nOnce these are mastered, have the student use the mouthpiece and instrument and reproduce the “DAH” syllable in their brain to create an articulated sound.\nThe tongue should feel the same when saying, singing and playing the mouthpiece and instrument.\nThe tongue should touch the enamel of the upper teeth directly below the gum line—in the same spot with the same strength every time.\nUse the syllable “DAH” because it creates smoother and more easily controlled air as opposed to the “TAH” syllable.\nAfter each “articulation”, the tongue must immediately fall down into its natural “at rest” position.\nThe tongue will be naturally soft at all times, but can touch the teeth with different strengths.\nThe tongue will be in its “down position” 98% of the time when articulating correctly.\nHave the student start their sound with the air.\nUsing the information about the basics of articulation, have the student articulate as fast as they can with no limitations of numbers, worries about evenness of articulation, etc.  Simply get the students used to articulating!\nHave the student then use the “ta-day” syllable to practice using the tongue in an organized manner.\nHave the student then articulate “on command.”  The student will start their sound, and articulate when you snap your fingers to practice gaining more control of the tongue.\nOnce the student understands pulse and the foot pat, have the student articulate exactly when the toe of the foot touches the floor.\nHave the student articulate with the down and up position of the foot.\nProceed to written rhythms as students begin to read music.\nAlways practice this entire routine.  The student must always go through the entire process, so he will not lose the ability to move his tongue at various speeds and in a structured manner.\nSLURRING ON THE TROMBONE\nSlurs can occur in 4 forms:\nLip Slur\nNo tongue\nSame position\nNatural Slur\nDifferent positions\nValve slur\nSame or different positions\nLegato slur\nLegato tongue\nThe only slur that requires a tongue-start is a legato slur. Legato slurs occur between notes that are on the same harmonic/partial. Notes on the same partial can cause a “glissando” and the legato slur is used to prevent that “smear” effect.\nLegato slurs require:\nA soft legato syllable, “dah” or “doo,” that brushes very lightly (think 3 taste buds)\nThe tongue brushes on the ridge above the teeth; the legato tongue does not touch enamel.\nThe tongue must move away quickly to prevent compression of the air.\nThe tongue must be synchronized with an efficient slide movement.\nIf beginning students are taught to slur correctly from the onset, the students will be ahead of the game when transitioning through middle school/junior high. Apart from correct slide positions, slurring on trombone is perhaps the most neglected aspect of playing by both young and experienced teachers; therefore, it is vital that students are set up for success by instilling proper habits from the beginning!\nTROMBONE FLEXIBILITY AND RANGE EXTENSION\nBrass playing is based upon flexibility.\nThere are two types of flexibility: flexibility within the instrument and flexibility within the note.\nStudents eventually need to be flexible through each of the harmonic series in order to move up and down within the range of the instrument.\nOnce the student can reproduce at will a given pitch, the teacher must decide whether flexibility up or down is needed first.\nFlexibility is controlled by air direction and the isometrics created by the corners and canine/eye teeth.  The head must always stay in its natural, balanced position at all times.  The angle of the instrument must not change at any time.\nStudents must learn to angle the air in the cup of the mouthpiece without changing the position of the lips and/or the relationship of the upper and lower teeth.\nFlexibility is also enhanced by vowel sounds used in various registers.  These sounds can be “ah” for the middle register….”ee” for the upper register….and “oh” for the lower register.  Have students practice saying these vowel sounds with vocalization on appropriate lower, middle and higher sounds.\nThe speed of the air and the shape of the vowel guide flexibility.  The tongue assists the air speed similar to the way one’s thumb assists the water speed from a hose.  The tongue relaxes when descending into the lower register and arches when ascending into the upper register.\nBring to the students’ attention that the shape of the tongue changes dramatically from vowel sound to vowel sound.  All students should be aware that vowel sounds are the middles of words that they speak every day.  Practice saying words that use the required vowel sounds. (i.e.  bow, ball, beep)\nRange is developed through flexibility.  It is more important to create a resonant sound while practicing flexibility than to create wider intervals.  The student can enhance their range by making more resonant sounds in the middle register before trying to extend higher or lower.\nWhile it is important to create resonant sounds in the register students can play in, it is important for students to occasionally try exploring both the upper and lower range they struggle to make a good sound in.  This should be practiced perhaps twice a week.\nMake sure students understand the texture of the lips have nothing to do with range. For example, students should never be told to “tighten” their lips in order to play in the higher register.\nTROMBONE SLIDE MAINTENANCE\nProper care of the trombone slide is crucial for the well-being of the instrument. A poorly maintained trombone can start deteriorating in quality in as little as 5 years.\nIt is suggested that the slide be cleaned at least every 7-10 days. If the trombone is going to be “put away” for an extended amount of time, it needs to be cleaned beforehand to minimize the moisture trapped inside the instrument while not in use.\nMaterials needed:\nCleaning rod\nCheesecloth\nGlass cleaner or mild soap and water\nTrombotine, Yamaha Slide Lubricant, or Slide-O-Mix\nSpray bottle filled with water\nInsert at least a yard-length of cheesecloth through the eye of your cleaning rod. Wrap a small amount of cheesecloth around the tip of the cleaning rod to avoid damage if it hits the crook of the slide. Wrap the remainder of the cheesecloth around the length of the cleaning rod. One should have enough cheesecloth to hold onto as it inserts the slide so it does not get “lost” in the slide and become difficult to remove.\nInsert the cleaning rod and cheesecloth into the outer slide. Be careful not to hit the crook of the slide as it is entering. Move the cleaning rod in and out of the outer slide, creating friction as the cleaning rod moves. The friction breaks up the chemical bonds that hold the left-over slide lubricant in the slide.\nRepeat in the opposite end of the slide.\nThe same process should be used for the inner slide, but extreme care should be taken as the inner slide is the most fragile part of the entire instrument.\nAfter this process is complete, the cheesecloth should be disposed of.\nTake glass cleaner (or a mild soapy water solution) and gently clean the exterior of the inner slide. This will remove any residue left from previous applications of slide lubricant. Please note that the inner slide is plated nickel -- not silver -- therefore silver polish should not be used to clean it.\nOnce the inner slide is clean, apply the slide lubricant.\nYamaha Trombone Slide Lubricant\nApply evenly over both prongs of the inner slide.\nSpray with water.\nNo “working in” is necessary.\nSlide-O-Mix\nApply a drop from the small flask at the stockings (wide end) of the inner slide. Distribute evenly by putting on the outer slide and moving it up and down several times.\nApply liquid from the larger bottle at the top of the inner slide and let it trickle down the length of the slide. Once again, use the outer slide to help evenly distribute the lubricant.\nTrombotine (standard in most classrooms)\nApply a pea-sized amount of lubricant to the stocking (wide end) of the slide.\nBegin by working the lubricant into the stocking of the slide, and work your way up to the rest of the slide. Since the stocking is the wider part, it will have the most contact with the outer slide; it is therefore crucial that it is well-lubricated.\nThe Trombotine should form a thin (nearly invisible) layer over the inner slide.\nRepeat on the second prong of the inner slide.\nTrombotine can often act like a reed in the fact that it works in “cycles.” It can take 2-3 days to “break in” and feel most effective. Once this point has been reached, it will be at its best for about 7 days; then, it will deteriorate for 2-3 days, by which time the slide needs to be cleaned and re-lubricated."

The attachment simply makes playing the\ninstrument easier.\no  Tenor Trombone\n(cid:1)  The F-attachment on tenor trombone allows the\ntrombonist to reach notes not available on the small\nbore “straight’ horn. Most specifically, these notes are\nin the lower register (Eb below the staff to C below the\nstaff), which are typically played by the bass trombone\nanyway.\no  Bass Trombone\n(cid:1)  The bass trombone typically has two attachments and,\nthus, two triggers; these are generally F/Gb and D/Db\nattachments.\n(cid:1)  These attachments allow for lower notes to be played\nthat cannot necessarily be played with ease on the tenor\ntrombone.\n•  Types of Valves\no  Rotary\n(cid:1)  Standard design on most F-attachments\n(cid:1)  Attempts to emulate European style of trumpet playing\no  Thayer valve\n(cid:1)  Conically shaped\n(cid:1)  Smoother transitions\n(cid:1)  More open sound\nBass Trombone\n•  The bass trombone is a color instrument; it does not sound an\noctave lower than the trombone, but rather, there is a distinct,\ntimbral difference between the two instruments.\n•  The bass trombone has a rounder, fuller sound than the tenor\ntrombone, and in the lower register, an amount of controlled\nedge can produce a variety of effects for the ensemble.\n•  The bass trombone typically has two attachments and, thus, two\ntriggers; these are generally F/Gb and D/Db attachments.\n•  Requires a slightly larger mouthpiece than tenor trombone\n•  Should only be played by mature players in a high school\nensemble. Middle school/junior high students should not be\nplaying the instrument because it is too challenging given the\nphysical and mental development of students in that age group.\nContrabass Trombone\n•  Pitched in Bb; reads in concert pitch (non-transposing)\n•  Not much different from the bass trombone other than it has a\ndouble slide, which allows the instrument to play lower with\nmore ease than the bass trombone\n•  Not to be used in a middle school/junior high or high school\nband, as it is rarely used outside of a professional ensemble\n(much less in a professional ensemble!)\nValve Trombone\n(cid:1)  Pitched in Bb\n(cid:1)  It is shaped like a trombone but has valves where a\nslide should be; in other words, it is the platypus of the\ntrombone family.\n(cid:1)  Basically was developed for European polka bands and\nearly American military bands, but the most common\nuse today is a bass version known as the cimbasso,\nwhich is typically played by tuba players on a tuba\nmouthpiece in operatic works by Verdi and Puccini.\n(cid:1)  Not to be used in a middle school/junior high or high\nschool band, as it is a novelty instrument\nRECOMMENDED TROMBONE BRANDS\nBeginner:\nBrand: Yamaha\nModel: YSL-345\nPricing: MSRP $1,197.00 – wwbw.com\nDescription\n•  Preferred beginner instrument\n•  Made with quality material\ncomparable to Yamaha professional\ntrombones\nBrand: Bach\nModel: TB300\nPricing: MSRP $540.00 – wwbw.com\n•  Good beginner trombone\n•  Lighter weight\n•  Less expensive\nInformation Regarding Students “Stepping-Up” To A Professional Trombone\n•  Considering that most students use a rent-to-own trombone during their\nbeginner year, it is highly recommended that students “step-up” to a\nprofessional/trigger trombone within the next 2-3 years.\n•  Assuming that students stay in band until high school, one could use their\nbeginner trombone for marching band; however, as stated previously,\nstudents are strongly encouraged to “step-up”.\nProfessional:\nModel: 42BO\nPricing: MSRP $4,603.00 – wwbw.com\n•  Standard trombone for intermediate\nplayers\n•  Not uncommon in the professional world\n•  Open-wrap and rotary valve help create a more consistent tone in the trigger\nregister\n•  Bach trombones tend to be inconsistent from one instrument to another.\nBrand: Conn\nModel: 88H\nPricing: MSRP $3,997.00 – wwbw.com\n•  Good professional trombone\n•  Closed-wrap design\n•  VERY old design by Conn-Selmer\nBrand: Eastman by Shires\nModel: ETB630\nPricing: MSRP $2,360.00 –\ndillonmusic.com\n•  Custom-built trombone\n•  Shires is one of the leading trombone brands in the world.\n•  Shires is well liked for their ability to customize instruments for each\nindividual player.\n•  Uses an axial-flow valve for a smoother transition into the lower register\n•  Open-wrap\n•  Comes with 3 interchangeable leadpipes\nBrand: Edwards\nModel: T350-E\nPricing: MSRP $3,700.00+ - available\nonly through Edwards\n•  Edwards is another leading trombone brand.\n•  Full customization through Edwards is not uncommon\n•  Outstanding for orchestral-style playing\n•  Axial-flow valve\n•  Very consistent tone quality throughout the range of the instrument\n•  Consistent from one instrument to another\nModel: T398-A\nPricing: MSRP $4,700.00+ -\nAvailable only through Edwards\n•  Joseph Alessi model\n•  Versatile; suitable for orchestral and solo performance style of playing\n•  Rotax Valve\n•  Comes with “Harmonic Pillars” that are inserted into a brace that customizes\nthe density of the instrument, thus affecting tone, articulation, etc.\nInformation Regarding Professional Trombones\n•  Many professional trombones are handcrafted and custom-made, so prices\nwill vary.

The bore size\nis the inside diameter of the lead pipe. Small bore trombones are typically .500-\ninch and large bore trombones are typically .547-inch.\n(cid:1)  Small shank mouthpieces refer to mouthpieces that can fit on a straight trombone\nor small bore euphonium.\n(cid:1)  Large shank mouthpieces refer to mouthpieces that can fit on trombone with large\nbores (typically, those with secondary attachments) and euphoniums with large\nbores.\n(cid:1)  Mouthpiece adapters are made for people playing on small shank mouthpieces to\nplay on a large bore instrument. Do not use mouthpiece adapters, if possible – try\nto play on small shank mouthpieces for small bore instruments and large shank\nmouthpieces for large bore instruments. This is to maintain the integrity of the\nproportions that the instruments were designed to sound best on.\n•  Silver vs. gold plating\n(cid:1)  There has been much controversy surrounding the issue of playing on silver-plated\nor gold-plated mouthpieces. These include the following:\no  Endurance\no  Tone quality\no  Ease of playing\no  Overall embouchure health\n(cid:1)  So what is the truth? Because the embouchure is incredibly personal and can only\nbe truly determined and developed on an individual level, the issue, as a whole,\ndoes not really matter. Students will discover what works best for them as they\ndevelop, and they should only do so under the supervision of an experienced band\ndirector and/or private lesson instructor.\n(cid:1)  It is recommended to start beginners on a silver mouthpiece. A silver mouthpiece\nis cheaper, and because it is uncertain whether or not the student will have\nembouchure issues on the onset, there is no need to have students start on a gold\nmouthpiece (which is twice as expensive).\nPARTS OF THE TROMBONE MOUTHPIECE\nTROMBONE MAINTENANCE KIT –\nRECOMMENDED ITEMS\nTrombotine Slide Cream\nMSRP $9.00 @ wwbw.com\n•  Cream-based lubricant\n•  Store at room temperature.\nYamaha Trombone Slide\nLubricant\nMSRP $12.99 @ wwbw.com\n•\n•  Oil-based lubricant made\nwithout hydrocarbons\nIt will not “clump” on the\nslide and does not need to\nbe “broken in”.\nOR\nSlide-O-Mix\nMSRP $19.00 @ wwbw.com\n•  Liquid-based lubricant in\ntwo parts\n•  Do not buy the “Rapid\nComfort” brand – buy the\nsystem.\nMicro Trombone\nCleaning Snake\nMSRP $9.99 @ brookmays.com\n•  A snake is used to clean the\ninner and outer slides at\nleast every six months.\nSmall Spray Bottle\n•  A small spray bottle, filled\nwith water, is needed to help\nkeep the slide lubricated.\nCleaning Rod\nMSRP $10.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  A cleaning rod is used with\ncheesecloth to clean the\ninner slide of the trombone.\nCheesecloth\n•  Cheesecloth is used with\nthe cleaning rod to clean\nthe inner slide of the\nSchilke Tuning Slide\nGrease\nMSRP $6.00 @ wwbw.com\n•  The tuning slide grease\nshould be applied once or\ntwice a year and should be\nused very sparingly.\nLeblanc Polishing Cloth\nMSRP $11.00 @ wwbw.com\n•  A lacquer polishing cloth is very\nhelpful in the maintenance of any\ninstrument.

Place the case on the floor. Most latches on trombone cases face up.\n2.  Open the case, and make sure that both parts of the horn – as well as the mouthpiece\ncompartment – are secure.\n3.  Before removing the slide from the case, make sure the slide lock is on.\n4.  Unlatch and remove the slide from the case with the right hand. The palm will face down\non the slide bars.\n5.  Tip the slide immediately towards the floor, making the slide parallel with the body and\nwith the large end facing inward. The endpin on the slide should touch the ground. The\nslide will remain stationary for the remainder of the assembly process.\n6.  Unlatch and remove the bell from the case. The palm will face down near the bell brace.\nLift with the bell down and the counterweight up so that the bell is parallel with the body.\n7.  The bell will move toward the slide at the docking station. Tilting slightly away from the\nslide, the bell will rest down on top of the slide. Do not secure the bell to the slide until\nthe correct angle has been set.\n8.  To set the correct angle, have the student stand up and look down towards the trombone.\nRemember – the slide is not a crutch and the student should never lean on the trombone,\nespecially when it has not been secured.\n9.  The angle should be 180 degrees and should read like a clock at “2:45”.\n10. Slowly move the bell until the clock reads “3:00”. Then, move an additional five minutes\nto “3:05”.\n11. Secure the bell and the slide at the docking station until the first point of resistance.\n12. Holding the trombone in the left hand, carefully remove the mouthpiece with the right\nhand.\n13. Seat the mouthpiece gently into the lead pipe, and rotate 2/3 of a turn for a friction grip.\nHand Position\n•  With the left hand, form an “L”. Have the student wrap the bottom three fingers around\nthe left brace of the slide while the thumb wraps around the brace of the bell. The index\nfinger should lie relaxed on top of the upper slide brace.\n•  The thick pads of the left hand should never overlap to the outer slide. Students will\n“clip” their hands when moving the slide. This is the most common beginner “injury,”\nand it can easily be avoided.\n•  The right hand should hold the slide with fleshy part of the index and middle fingers and\nthe thumb (“two fingers and a thumb”).\n•  Bring the instrument to the face. Though not part of the hand, the elbows must never feel\nas though they are pulling the instrument toward the student’s face. Instruct students to\nkeep their elbows soft while playing the trombone.\n•  An “X” should form between the left and right arms and elbows should be on the same\nplane when holding the instrument correctly.\n•  All hands will fall in from the wrists. The body of the hand must never fall behind the\nwrist.\n•  There should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the trombone.\n•  The inside of the arm must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding the\ntrombone correctly. No body part touches another body part!\n•  Elbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be hampered.\n•  Remember, the left hand does not “grip” the instrument. No tension should be felt in this\nhand when holding the instrument.\n•  The palms of both hands should feel soft. The palm of the right hand should never touch\nthe instrument. The teacher should be able to clearly see a “circular” opening between the\nright hand and the slide.\n•  The student should understand that slide movement is aided by the soft tissue of the palm\nof the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand.\n•  The trombone is the most awkward instrument to hold out of all brass instruments, and\nstudents should be constantly reminded to keep a calm mind and a calm body. Take\nfrequent breaks so that students can build endurance when learning how to hold the\ninstrument to avoid bad habits from forming.\nInstrument/Body Ratio\n•  Assuming that the student is either standing or sitting with correct posture, instruct them\nto pick up the body of the trombone with both hands and simply lift it by using their\nelbows. Move the instrument up and down, side to side, higher than usual and lower than\nusual. As students are doing this, have them notice how it affects the balance of the body.\nEventually, the body should feel balanced with or without the instrument in hand.\nPARTS OF THE TROMBONE\nTuning\nSlide\n1st\nBrace\nSlide Receiver\nBell\nWater Key\nF-Attachment\nMouthpiece\nReceiver\n2nd\nSlide Lock\nPeg\nTROMBONE FACE/EMBOUCHURE\n•  Each student should use their own “safe/unbreakable” mirror – both in the classroom and\nat home.\n•  Using the mirror, have each student notice how natural their face looks. They will have to\nlater remember and memorize how it looks and feels.\n•  The head must be balanced on the shoulders in a comfortable position – not too far\nforward and not too far backward.\n•  The eyes should be soft and natural and the “sight line” should be exactly level. The\ndistance between eyebrows should not change as air goes in and out of the body.\n•  Look for natural creases in the face, and allow any that are naturally present to exist\nwhile playing. No other creases are allowed.\n•  The corners should move in toward the canine teeth. The corners should never look or\nfeel pulled back.\n•  The corners can move down from the natural position as the student progresses, but they\ncan never move up.\n•  The texture of both the upper and lower lip should be very soft and relaxed.\n•  There should be natural space between the inside of the lips and the gums and teeth. This\nspace should not change or feel different when the lips vibrate inside the cup of the\nmouthpiece.\n•  The back teeth are slightly apart and should feel the same as when the student is reading,\nwatching television, etc. The teeth should not be pressed into each other when doing\nthese other activities.\n•  Brass instrument embouchures are formed with natural overbite. A student with an\nunderbite should be steered away from brass instruments.\n•  The thickness of a student’s lips should correspond to the size of the cup of the\nmouthpiece for the chosen instrument. Students with a very thin top or bottom lip should\nbe steered towards high brass instruments rather than trombone.\n•  The bottom of the front of the tongue should lie in the soft tissue area which is located in\nthe front of the mouth just behind the ridge of the bottom gum.\n•  Remember that when playing the trombone, cheeks will only “puff out” if the air is\nnot freely going into the instrument. This should be avoided!\n•  Assuming that the above has been achieved, the embouchure will be formed with special\nattention to the following:\no  The mouthpiece must be placed in the middle of the mouth – up and down as well\nas side to side.\no  The corners are in their natural position and should be set against the canine teeth.\no  The lips must be allowed to freely vibrate in response to the airstream rather than\nmade to “buzz” in front of the airstream.\no  The lips must feel natural so that air can freely move past them – they must not be\npulled back against the teeth or blown away from the teeth and gums.\no  The students should remember that the mouthpiece “gathers” the air – not the lips.\no  There must never be more energy placed against the upper lip than the lower lip;\nhence the mouthpiece (and the instrument) will angle slightly downwards.\nTROMBONE ARTICULATION\n•  The  tongue  moves  in  the  same  manner  when  articulating  a  brass  instrument  as  it  does\nwhen  you  speak.    The  tongue  moves  up  and  down—not  back  and  forth—both  when\nspeaking and when articulation on an instrument.\n•  The purpose of the tongue is to release the air which causes the lips to vibrate and creates\nthe  sound.    The  tongue’s  release  of  the  air  simply  defines  the  beginning/start  of  the\nvibration/sound.\n•  Articulation is used to define the vibrations necessary to create musical rhythm, style and\nmovement--to contrast the use of slurring (which also creates similar musical entities).\n•  The students should think that the tongue “articulates” the sound created by the airstream.\nIf the student is taught to create the sound correctly, articulation will be an easy\ntransition.\na.  sound occurs when the air moves past the naturally vibrating lips\nb.  articulate the sound that is already present\nc.  teach students to articulate at the moment the sound begins\n•  Without the instrument or mouthpiece, use the following procedure:\n1.  Say the word “DOG”.\n2.  Sing the syllable “DAH”.\n3.  Once these are mastered, have the student use the mouthpiece and instrument\nand reproduce the “DAH” syllable in their brain to create an articulated sound.\n4.  The tongue should feel the same when saying, singing and playing the\nmouthpiece and instrument.\n5.  The tongue should touch the enamel of the upper teeth directly below the gum\nline—in the same spot with the same strength every time.\n6.  Use the syllable “DAH” because it creates smoother and more easily\ncontrolled air as opposed to the “TAH” syllable.\n7.  After each “articulation”, the tongue must immediately fall down into its\nnatural “at rest” position.\n8.  The tongue will be naturally soft at all times, but can touch the teeth with\ndifferent strengths.\n9.  The tongue will be in its “down position” 98% of the time when articulating\ncorrectly.\n•  Have the student start their sound with the air.\n•  Using the information about the basics of articulation, have the student articulate as fast\nas they can with no limitations of numbers, worries about evenness of articulation, etc.\nSimply get the students used to articulating!\n•  Have the student then use the “ta-day” syllable to practice using the tongue in an\norganized manner.\n•  Have the student then articulate “on command.”  The student will start their sound, and\narticulate when you snap your fingers to practice gaining more control of the tongue.\n•  Once the student understands pulse and the foot pat, have the student articulate exactly\nwhen the toe of the foot touches the floor.\n•  Have the student articulate with the down and up position of the foot.\n•  Proceed to written rhythms as students begin to read music.\nAlways practice this entire routine.  The student must always go through the entire\nprocess, so he will not lose the ability to move his tongue at various speeds and in a\nstructured manner.\nSLURRING ON THE TROMBONE\n•  Slurs can occur in 4 forms:\n(cid:1)  Lip Slur\no  No tongue\no  Same position\n(cid:1)  Natural Slur\no  Different positions\n(cid:1)  Valve slur\no  Same or different positions\n(cid:1)  Legato slur\no  Legato tongue\n•  The only slur that requires a tongue-start is a legato slur. Legato slurs occur between\nnotes that are on the same harmonic/partial. Notes on the same partial can cause a\n“glissando” and the legato slur is used to prevent that “smear” effect.\n•  Legato slurs require:\n(cid:1)  A soft legato syllable, “dah” or “doo,” that brushes very lightly (think 3 taste buds)\n(cid:1)  The tongue brushes on the ridge above the teeth; the legato tongue does not touch\nenamel.\n(cid:1)  The tongue must move away quickly to prevent compression of the air.\n(cid:1)  The tongue must be synchronized with an efficient slide movement.\nIf beginning students are taught to slur correctly from the onset, the students will be ahead of the\ngame when transitioning through middle school/junior high. Apart from correct slide positions,\nslurring on trombone is perhaps the most neglected aspect of playing by both young and\nexperienced teachers; therefore, it is vital that students are set up for success by instilling proper\nhabits from the beginning!\nTROMBONE FLEXIBILITY AND RANGE\nEXTENSION\n•  Brass playing is based upon flexibility.\n•  There are two types of flexibility: flexibility within the instrument and flexibility within\nthe note.\n•  Students eventually need to be flexible through each of the harmonic series in order to\nmove up and down within the range of the instrument.\n•  Once the student can reproduce at will a given pitch, the teacher must decide whether\nflexibility up or down is needed first.\n•  Flexibility is controlled by air direction and the isometrics created by the corners and\ncanine/eye teeth.  The head must always stay in its natural, balanced position at all times.\nThe angle of the instrument must not change at any time.\n•  Students must learn to angle the air in the cup of the mouthpiece without changing the\nposition of the lips and/or the relationship of the upper and lower teeth.\n•  Flexibility is also enhanced by vowel sounds used in various registers.  These sounds can\nbe “ah” for the middle register….”ee” for the upper register….and “oh” for the lower\nregister.  Have students practice saying these vowel sounds with vocalization on\nappropriate lower, middle and higher sounds.\n•  The speed of the air and the shape of the vowel guide flexibility.  The tongue assists the\nair speed similar to the way one’s thumb assists the water speed from a hose.  The tongue\nrelaxes when descending into the lower register and arches when ascending into the\nupper register.\n•  Bring to the students’ attention that the shape of the tongue changes dramatically from\nvowel sound to vowel sound.  All students should be aware that vowel sounds are the\nmiddles of words that they speak every day.  Practice saying words that use the required\nvowel sounds. (i.e.  bow, ball, beep)\n•  Range is developed through flexibility.  It is more important to create a resonant sound\nwhile practicing flexibility than to create wider intervals.  The student can enhance their\nrange by making more resonant sounds in the middle register before trying to extend\nhigher or lower.\n•  While it is important to create resonant sounds in the register students can play in, it is\nimportant for students to occasionally try exploring both the upper and lower range they\nstruggle to make a good sound in.  This should be practiced perhaps twice a week.\n•  Make sure students understand the texture of the lips have nothing to do with range. For\nexample, students should never be told to “tighten” their lips in order to play in the higher\nregister.\nTROMBONE SLIDE MAINTENANCE\n•  Proper care of the trombone slide is crucial for the well-being of the instrument. A poorly\nmaintained trombone can start deteriorating in quality in as little as 5 years.\nIt is suggested that the slide be cleaned at least every 7-10 days. If the trombone is going\nto be “put away” for an extended amount of time, it needs to be cleaned beforehand to\nminimize the moisture trapped inside the instrument while not in use.\n•  Materials needed:\n(cid:1)  Cleaning rod\n(cid:1)  Cheesecloth\n(cid:1)  Glass cleaner or mild soap and water\n(cid:1)  Trombotine, Yamaha Slide Lubricant, or Slide-O-Mix\n(cid:1)  Spray bottle filled with water\nInsert at least a yard-length of cheesecloth through the eye of your cleaning rod. Wrap a\nsmall amount of cheesecloth around the tip of the cleaning rod to avoid damage if it hits\nthe crook of the slide. Wrap the remainder of the cheesecloth around the length of the\ncleaning rod. One should have enough cheesecloth to hold onto as it inserts the slide so it\ndoes not get “lost” in the slide and become difficult to remove.\nInsert the cleaning rod and cheesecloth into the outer slide. Be careful not to hit the crook\nof the slide as it is entering. Move the cleaning rod in and out of the outer slide, creating\nfriction as the cleaning rod moves. The friction breaks up the chemical bonds that hold\nthe left-over slide lubricant in the slide.\n•  Repeat in the opposite end of the slide.\n•  The same process should be used for the inner slide, but extreme care should be taken as\nthe inner slide is the most fragile part of the entire instrument.\n•  After this process is complete, the cheesecloth should be disposed of.\n•  Take glass cleaner (or a mild soapy water solution) and gently clean the exterior of the\ninner slide. This will remove any residue left from previous applications of slide\nlubricant. Please note that the inner slide is plated nickel -- not silver -- therefore silver\npolish should not be used to clean it.\n•  Once the inner slide is clean, apply the slide lubricant.\no  Yamaha Trombone Slide Lubricant\n(cid:1)  Apply evenly over both prongs of the inner slide.\n(cid:1)  Spray with water.\n(cid:1)  No “working in” is necessary.\no  Slide-O-Mix\n(cid:1)  Apply a drop from the small flask at the stockings (wide end) of the inner\nslide. Distribute evenly by putting on the outer slide and moving it up and\ndown several times.\n•  Apply liquid from the larger bottle at the top of the inner slide and let it\ntrickle down the length of the slide. Once again, use the outer slide to help\nevenly distribute the lubricant.\n•  Spray with water.\no  Trombotine (standard in most classrooms)\n•  Apply a pea-sized amount of lubricant to the stocking (wide end) of the\nslide.\n•  Begin by working the lubricant into the stocking of the slide, and work\nyour way up to the rest of the slide. Since the stocking is the wider part, it\nwill have the most contact with the outer slide; it is therefore crucial that it\nis well-lubricated.\n•  The Trombotine should form a thin (nearly invisible) layer over the inner\n•  Repeat on the second prong of the inner slide.\n•  Trombotine can often act like a reed in the fact that it works in “cycles.” It\ncan take 2-3 days to “break in” and feel most effective. Once this point has\nbeen reached, it will be at its best for about 7 days; then, it will deteriorate\nfor 2-3 days, by which time the slide needs to be cleaned and re-\nlubricated.\nTROMBONE/EUPHONIUM WARM-UP SHEET #1\n1\n?\n4 w\n4\n? w\n2\n? wb\nwb\n3\nw\n∑\n? ˙\n˙b\n? ˙b\n? œ\nœ\nœb\n? œb\n5\n˙\nTROMBONE/EUPHONIUM WARM-UP SHEET #2\n4 œ œ œ œ\nœ œ œ\nœ œ œ œ\nœ œ\nœ#\nœ œ œ ˙\nœ œ œ œ œ\nœ ˙\nŒ\nœ œ#\nœ œb\nTROMBONE/EUPHONIUM CHROMATIC SCALE\n? 44\n? œ#\nTROMBONE/EUPHONIUM CHRISTMAS TUNES\nJingle Bells\n? 44 œ\nGood King Wenceslas\n4 œb\nÓ"

    "text": "GETTING YOUR DOUBLE REED CLASS STARTED\n  During your beginner drives, inform the oboe and bassoon parents that their children\nwere “hand picked”, and that it is a special privilege to be selected for the double reed\nclass—the smallest beginning class taught.  With that said, you would like to get the\nstudents started in a separate oboe and bassoon classes—with an oboe/bassoon\nspecialist—before the official start of the school year.\nIn order to alleviate potential vacation conflicts during the summer, you are\nrecommended to schedule these classes the week before school starts—or at the very\nleast in early to mid-August.\n\n  Do not schedule, for example, your oboe class at the same time as your bassoon class.\nEach class should meet separately, even though they will be combined during the actual\nclass period throughout the school year.\n  It is vital that the teacher of record be present in all of these classes.  This instructor\nshould not schedule anything else during this time (i.e. inservice meetings/trainings,\nparent meetings, etc.).  Detailed notes should be taken in regard to everything being\nsaid and done by the specialists while they are working with YOUR students!\n  To get the most out of these classes, try to schedule 3-4 classes for 1 hour.  The time of\nday should be determined after finding out how the students will get to your school—\neither by walking or a getting a ride from their parents.\n  Create a flyer that includes the tentative dates, tentative times, cost, instructor name, etc.\nThese flyers need to be given to the parents at the drive.  Indicate on the flyer that the\nparents are invited to attend the very last class to meet the instructor.\n  After all of your recruited double reed students have “come through” your instrument\ndrive(s), call each parent to confirm that they have no conflicts with the dates and times\nof the classes.  If there are conflicts with even 1 student, try your best to move the classes\nto dates/times where everyone can be present.\n  Students and parents need to understand that once school starts, the oboes and bassoons\nwill be in the same beginner class daily.\n  Students should be charged a private lesson cost for each class (i.e. $15 X 4 classes =\n$60.  Make sure the parents understand that this is NOT a weekly cost during the\nschool year—unless of course the student is taking private lessons.\nIn addition to the payments collected by the students, you need to offer the specialists a\nmileage surcharge, as well as lunch/dinner if applicable.\n  Make sure that your music store road man delivers the oboe and maintenance kits in\nplenty of time for the first class; especially the reeds.\n  Make sure you have instruments assigned for each oboe and bassoon student.  If these\ninstruments were sent to the repair shop during the summer, ask your road man to ensure\ntheir completion—and delivery—in plenty of time for the first class.\n  During the actual week of summer classes, send out a reminder invitation for the parents\nto attend the very last class.  On this day, you need to have private lesson forms ready to\npass out.\nIntroduce the specialists to the parents during the last class.  Explain to the parents how\nfortunate the students were to have a specialist working with their children.  If the\nspecialist happens to be your campus private lesson instructor as well, inform the\nparents of this as well!\n  Explain the benefits of your private lesson program and distribute private lesson forms.\nReiterate that the payment they made for the summer classes would be equivalent to an\nentire MONTH of private lessons, and that most months would have 3-4 lesson dates.\n  Make arrangements to have payments ready for the specialists at the conclusion of the\nlast summer class.\n  The better you treat your specialists (more specifically if this specialist is also your\ncampus private lesson instructor), the more likely they are to make homemade reeds for\nyour students after they have “gone through” their first 3-4 store-bought reeds that were\nincluded in their maintenance kits.\n  Attempt to book the specialists/private lesson instructors as much in advance as possible\nfor the next summer.\n  You are highly discouraged from moving students from other woodwind instruments\nthat they have already been playing (flute or a single reed instrument)…….. to oboe and\nbassoon.  Try very hard to find students that would excel on double reed instruments\nfrom the beginning!  If you have physical oboes and bassoons in your inventory, USE\nTHEM!!    There are, however, exceptions; for example, you may have a student that is\njust not “getting it” on another instrument……….or you may have a move-in student that\nmay have been recruited to play oboe or bassoon at their previous school, but you may be\napprehensive about that decision and want to re-test them on other instruments.\n  Factors that must be considered when moving a student from another instrument—that\nthey have already been playing—to a double reed instrument:\no  size of the case may be significantly different\no  reed costs (if moving from clarinet or saxophone)\no  new maintenance kit needed\no  returning the previous instrument to the music store (if it was being rented)\no\nthe student possibly having to read a different clef\n  Positive factors that must be considered when moving a student to a double reed\ninstrument:\nthe double reed class will be the smallest homogeneous class in your band\nprogram; therefore, students will receive more attention\no  because the class is smaller, it will move faster than their previous class\no  no monthly rental cost of the instrument because it is now school-owned"

    "text": "CHARACTERISTICS WHEN RECRUITING AND\nSELECTING OBOE AND BASSOON PLAYERS\nGeneral Physical Characteristics for Oboe and Bassoon\n  Students having overbites are fine; however, underbites are not recommended.\n  The length of tissue from the bottom of the nose to the bottom of the upper lip\nmust be long. This is vital in order to achieve the desired double reed\nembouchure.\n  Check to see if the student’s lips line up with their teeth.\n  Students should have high cheek bones.\n  Students should have developed thighs to better balance and support the\ndiaphragm area in order to achieve a more mature and resonant tone quality.\n  Students with well-defined hands will have better finger dexterity.\n  Avoid recruiting students on double reed instruments that are double-jointed.\nAdditional Physical Characteristics for Oboe\n  Students recruited to play oboe need to have long enough fingers to cover the\nmiddle holes of keys.\n  Students should have a larger stretch between their right hand thumb and pinky, in\norder to activate all of the necessary bottom keys.\nAdditional Physical Characteristics for Bassoon\n  Students recruited to play bassoon need to have a large stretch between their left\nhand thumb and middle finger, in order to eventually be able to activate all of the\nnecessary thumb keys.\n\nIdeally, students recruited to play bassoon need to be taller and have long arms.\n  Students recruited to play bassoon need to have big enough hands to reach around\nthe bassoon.\nNon-Physical Characteristics\n  Students need to have a genuine interest in the instrument.  Since it is challenging\nto find 5th grade students who want to play the oboe or bassoon, make sure that\nyou successfully represent these instruments at your 5th grade recruiting concert.\n  Students must score in the higher percentile on the musical aptitude test you\nadminister (if applicable).  At the very least, strive to select students that have\ngood ears.\n  Specific to oboe, select students who will not be afraid to be heard.\n  Students recruited need to be passionate about music in general.\n  Parents of perspective double reed students need to be very pro-active and/or\ninvolved.\n  Students recruited to play double reed instruments need to be academically strong,\nresponsible and be overachievers.\n  Piano background is a plus--but cannot/should not be required.\n  Students officially recruited to play double reed instruments need to show\ncommitment for the duration of their middle school/junior high band experience\n(3 years).\nMiscellaneous\n  Be cautious about putting all Asian students on double reed instruments (for\nfuture academic reasons).\n  Be cautious of putting your only tall boys on bassoon, especially if they express\ninterest in athletics down the road.\n  You are recommended in starting oboes in groups of 3 or 4 students—and\nbassoons in groups of 3 or 4 students---as opposed to starting only 2 (in the event\nthat 1 student quits at the semester or end of the year, etc.).\n  Do not have students switch from oboe to bassoon or vice versa.  You need to be\ncertain that you are putting the right student on the right instrument from the\nbeginning!"

    "text": "BASSOON-THE BOCAL\nBocal Care\nThe bocal is the most fragile part of the instrument.\nStudents must be taught to be protective of the bocal.\nMany schools that have good bassoons also have bent or broken bocals  … which is caused by students grabbing the straight part of the bocal during assembly/disassembly. Teachers should closely monitor students to make sure that bocals are not damaged.\nMost accidents cause bocals to become bent in the rounded part of the crook.\nIf a bassoon must be set down for any reason, it should never be laid on a chair… no matter the design of the chair. It is best to stand the bassoon up in a corner at a slight angle, whether the floor is carpeted or not. This is the absolute best way to place an unattended bassoon.\nA bassoon should never be left on the ground or in a chair with the bocal inserted up in the air.\nWhen a bassoon is left unattended or carried/moved from one place to another, the bocal should be placed in the bell… … NEVER IN THE WING JOINT OPENING!\nTo clean the bocal, run hot soapy water and a bocal swab through the bocal on a monthly basis.\nPitch and the Bocal\nA common misconception is that the pitch on a bassoon can be controlled with the length of the bocal; however, pitch on the bassoon is primarily controlled by the embouchure, airstream, and the size/shape of the reed.\nThere is no affect on pitch by pulling out or pushing in the bocal.\nProfessional bassoonists use shorter bocals (#1 instead of  #2) for playing in the extreme high register of the instrument. For example, a bassoonist may choose to use a #1 bocal to play specific sections of the Rite of Spring by Stravinsky.\nSome common reed manufacturers use a reed shape that is too long and wide, which creates a very flat and unfocused sound that no bocal can correct. If a student is having pitch problems, they should work towards better embouchure flexibility and correct airstream, as well as experimenting with different reed styles.\nBocal Markings\nMost bocals have descriptive markings engraved into the surface that indicate the brand name and size.\nFox bocals are only marked with “C”, “CVX”, or “CVC”……usually not with the name Fox, but with the Fox logo/insignia.\nHeckel and Puchner bocals are inscribed with the manufacturer’s name. There are several bassoon makers that do not put markings of any type on the bocal.\nOn most, if not all, Fox, Puchner and Heckel bocal lengths are indicated by the numbers “1”, “2”, or “3.”\nIt is highly recommended that most, if not all students, use a #2 bocal."

Make sure that the cup or hook of the seat strap is on the right side.\nSit towards the back of the chair while holding the instrument. Make sure the right side of the body is aligned with the right side of the chair.\nLook for an indentation on the base of the spine above the belt line.\nThe height of the student should be maximized.\nAssuming the student’s posture is correct, the shoulder blades should be even (level) across the back.\nDo not let the students distort their torso.\nHook the instrument to the seat strap and adjust the strap until the bocal is entering straight into the mouths while seated in a relaxed position.\nPlace the left hand on the instrument, demonstrating the position of the fingers on the tone holes……and with the thumb on the wisper key. After the fingers have been positioned in the correct place, become aware of where the bassoon is balanced on the index finger. Allow the right hand to loosely position over the boot or on the crutch.\nIdeally, the weight of the instrument should be balanced by the body and not leaning too heavily on the left hand. Avoid holding the instrument at an angle like a saxophone, because the weight of the instrument will cause the student to lean forward and the left hand will be strained under the pressure.\nOnce the teacher is comfortable with the student’s posture, the student can walk around the room holding the bassoon. Hold the seat strap in the right hand, which is holding the boot in place…and the right hand should hold the wing/long joint.  The parts of the bassoon will not slip apart if students are holding it in this manner. This will furthermore allow students to become more comfortable holding the bassoon."

Never pick up the bassoon by the bell or the middle with one hand, because it could come apart and result in costly repair.\nKeep a supply of a dozen wisper key pads on hand. Students hit this pad with the bocal nub and they fall off frequently.\nDo not use clarinet or saxophone pads on the bassoon. They are made of different materials and are different heights and thicknesses and will drastically change the pitch of the instrument. It is easy to order pad replacement kits from the Fox factory or any online double reed supplier.\nStudents who have wooden bassoons should keep a lint-free cloth between the wing and long joints when storing the bassoon in its case. This will prevent damage to the wood of the wing joint and help keep the instrument in good working condition.\nIt is exceptionally important to swab wooden bassoons EVERY time they are played to prevent wood rot in the boot joint and keep the pads dry. Students should swab the wing joint and the boot joint with cotton swabs.\nIf a swab is stuck in the instrument, DO NOT PULL IT OUT. If you can extract it from the same direction it entered the instrument you will be able to safely remove it. Remember, the wing joint is smaller at the top (where the bocal is inserted) and wider at the bottom (where it enters the boot joint). Double reed suppliers sell swab extractors for this emergency.\nSuggested Repair Supplies:\nComplete replacement set of pads from the Fox factory.\nWisper key pads (at least a dozen)\nPlumbing tape\nSwab extractor\nCork grease"

This occurs by the pivoting or rocking the finger up and down, still keeping contact with the bottom rim of the opening (or water tube).\nHalf-hole notes include the following:\nThe lower the note, the less hole needs to be covered. This applies in both the middle and high register.\nThe G#/Ab needs less of an opening than the F#/Gb (quarter-hole). This will prevent cracks at the start of the notes.\nAll half-hole fingerings must include the whisper key being used.\nThere are two notes which have the option to half-hole the left middle finger: high F#/Gb (for intonation purposes) and super high D (part of the fingering). The same concept of achieving half-hole occurs. These fingerings do not include the whisper key.\nFlicking\nFlicking refers to the addition of thumb keys while playing the following notes:\nFlicking keeps these notes from “cracking”.\nFlicking ensures a clean, quick and resonant attack.\nThe “flick key” needs to be depressed at the exact same time that students articulate and position the note they are playing.\nStudents can either hold the flick key down (which affects the tone on most bassoons and therefore not recommended)……..or release it right away (which is recommended).\nIt is possible to play the aforementioned notes without flicking; it depends on the passage."

Identify these marks, and their relationship to the top and bottom of the case. Most cases have the handles placed on the bottom section of each case. Check to make sure.\nPlace all cases on the floor in front of the student.\nBe sure the student understands where each part of the instrument belongs in the case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make sure the student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure the parts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse order they were removed.\nAll instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure explicitly every time.\nNever leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up, but this is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.  Check each opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to your students.\nCases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe place in the classroom setup for each student’s case.\nInstrument Assembly\nPlace the open case on the floor in front of the student.\nPick up the boot joint with your left hand. Refer to the attached descriptive picture of the parts of the bassoon.\nPick up the wing joint with your right hand.\nInsert the wing joint into the smaller hole at the top of the boot joint. There may be slight markings at the top of the boot and the bottom of the wing, which can be aligned to insure the parts are together correctly (the rounded parts will match).\nPick up the long joint and insert into the large hole of the boot joint so that the metal block in the middle meets the protruding middle of the wing joint. The long joint may have a body lock that can slide into the wing joint.\nSlide the bell onto the top of the bassoon so that the extensions of the Bb key meet each other.\nStudents having trouble with assembling or disassembling the instrument should try twisting back and forth before they pull.\nThe most fragile part of the bassoon is the bocal. Care must be taken to gently hold the bocal on top of the rounded part of the crook (not the long slender portion). Gently wiggle the bocal back and forth to insert into the top of the wing joint but avoid colliding with the whisper key pad. Align the nub of the bocal with the whisper key pad. Refer to the handout regarding specific information about the bocal.\nIf the student wishes to use a crutch, insert the crutch into the hole on the boot joint.\nIf the crutch causes the student’s hand position to be too high to activate the pinky keys, the student should learn to balance the instrument without using the crutch; otherwise, the crutch may be used at the discretion of the player.\nInstrument/Body Ratio\nFamiliarize the student with the instrument/body ratio by using the instrument without the reed.\nThe left hand should gently hold and eventually balance the wing joint in the same manner used to assemble the instrument--without putting pressure on the long keys.\nThe right hand should balance the long joint in the same manner used to assemble the instrument.\nFamiliarize the student in this manner for a few days before placing the fingers in their correct position."

    "text": "BASSOON EMBOUCHURE\nStudents must be able to use air correctly before beginning to learn the\nbassoon embouchure.\nThere should be no lines or dimples that do not appear in the natural face.  The face essentially should be “zombie” - like.\nKeep the body and face calm and still while learning this embouchure.\nThe embouchure is non-structural and is a constant work in progress.\nThe general formation of the mouth is such that the teeth and jaw are apart while holding the lips in the shape of the word “mo.”  The reed should be inserted in the mouth almost to the wire. If the blade is covered by the lips, you will hear less vibration of the reed or “buzz” in the sound; thus, the quality of the sound is controlled by combining the cushioning of the lips with STRONG AIR blown through the small opening of the reed.\nThe following process should be taught to students:\nMake a cushion with the bottom lip. Refrain from mentioning corners when first teaching the embouchure.\nThe texture of the lips should be soft and relaxed.\nThe reed should rest on the cushion created by the lower lip.\nThe reed touches where the wet and dry part of the lips meet. There should be no pressure on the bottom of the reed.\nThe upper lip moves “down and out” to meet the reed, which causes the jaw to drop naturally.\nThe top lip should almost touch the wire.\nAfter the teacher identifies a correct embouchure/sound, students need to remember how it feels and sounds.\nBe sure the student can control the air well enough to find the correct balance of\nair and resistance to create the desired sound.\nThe bassoon embouchure is both internal and external. Many young players make the mistake of forming their mouth so that it can look deceptively accurate from the outside without holding their jaw correctly. This can be addressed with an exercise called the “donkey game” (this is attributed to Cheryl Huddleston, former bassoon professor at the University of Houston). The “donkey game” is as follows:\nWhile fingering second space C, use the embouchure to drop the pitch down to second line B and back up the second space C.\nThis means that internally the student is vocalizing “eee / aw / eee.”\nThe bassoon middle range resonates in the mask (the upper part of the face).\nWhile learning the embouchure, the tongue should sit in the bottom of the mouth.\nMost beginners play very flat because they do not know how to blow strong enough air. The incorrect tendency is to raise the pitch by biting or using the teeth to strengthen the support of the lips. If the young bassoonist does not learn to blow strong air and raise the pitch with good breath support, they will mature into players who consistently play sharp and will have difficulty learning to play above the break. This will become obvious when they must learn to play above the bass clef staff E and F."

Identify these marks,\nand their relationship to the top and bottom of the case. Most cases have the handles\nplaced on the bottom section of each case. Check to make sure.\n•  Place all cases on the floor in front of the student.\n•  Be sure the student understands where each part of the instrument belongs in the case.\nGive detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make sure the student\nwaits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure the parts of the\ninstrument are returned to the case in the reverse order they were removed.\n•  All instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure explicitly\nevery time.\n•  Never leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up, but this is\nnot always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.  Check each\nopening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to your students.\n•  Cases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe place in the classroom setup\nfor each student’s case.\nInstrument Assembly\n•  Place the open case on the floor in front of the student.\n•  Pick up the boot joint with your left hand. Refer to the attached descriptive picture of\nthe parts of the bassoon.\n•  Pick up the wing joint with your right hand.\n•\nInsert the wing joint into the smaller hole at the top of the boot joint. There may be\nslight markings at the top of the boot and the bottom of the wing, which can be\naligned to insure the parts are together correctly (the rounded parts will match).\n•  Pick up the long joint and insert into the large hole of the boot joint so that the metal\nblock in the middle meets the protruding middle of the wing joint. The long joint may\nhave a body lock that can slide into the wing joint.\n•  Slide the bell onto the top of the bassoon so that the extensions of the Bb key meet\neach other.\n•  Students having trouble with assembling or disassembling the instrument should try\ntwisting back and forth before they pull.\n•  The most fragile part of the bassoon is the bocal. Care must be taken to gently hold\nthe bocal on top of the rounded part of the crook (not the long slender portion).\nGently wiggle the bocal back and forth to insert into the top of the wing joint but\navoid colliding with the whisper key pad. Align the nub of the bocal with the whisper\nkey pad. Refer to the handout regarding specific information about the bocal.\nIf the student wishes to use a crutch, insert the crutch into the hole on the boot joint.\nIf the crutch causes the student’s hand position to be too high to activate the pinky\nkeys, the student should learn to balance the instrument without using the crutch;\notherwise, the crutch may be used at the discretion of the player.\nInstrument/Body Ratio\n•  Familiarize the student with the instrument/body ratio by using the instrument\nwithout the reed.\n•  The left hand should gently hold and eventually balance the wing joint in the same\nmanner used to assemble the instrument--without putting pressure on the long keys.\n•  The right hand should balance the long joint in the same manner used to assemble the\ninstrument.\n•  Familiarize the student in this manner for a few days before placing the fingers in\ntheir correct position.\nBASSOON-BALANCING THE BASSOON\n•  Place the seat strap across the FRONT of the chair. Make sure that the\ncup or hook of the seat strap is on the right side.\n•  Sit towards the back of the chair while holding the instrument. Make sure\nthe right side of the body is aligned with the right side of the chair.\n•  Look for an indentation on the base of the spine above the belt line.\n•  The height of the student should be maximized.\n•  Assuming the student’s posture is correct, the shoulder blades should be\neven (level) across the back.\n•  Do not let the students distort their torso.\n•  Hook the instrument to the seat strap and adjust the strap until the bocal\nis entering straight into the mouths while seated in a relaxed position.\n•  Place the left hand on the instrument, demonstrating the position of the\nfingers on the tone holes……and with the thumb on the wisper key. After\nthe fingers have been positioned in the correct place, become aware of\nwhere the bassoon is balanced on the index finger. Allow the right hand\nto loosely position over the boot or on the crutch.\n•  Ideally, the weight of the instrument should be balanced by the body and\nnot leaning too heavily on the left hand. Avoid holding the instrument at\nan angle like a saxophone, because the weight of the instrument will\ncause the student to lean forward and the left hand will be strained under\nthe pressure.\n•  Once the teacher is comfortable with the student’s posture, the student\ncan walk around the room holding the bassoon. Hold the seat strap in the\nright hand, which is holding the boot in place…and the right hand should\nhold the wing/long joint.  The parts of the bassoon will not slip apart if\nstudents are holding it in this manner. This will furthermore allow\nstudents to become more comfortable holding the bassoon.\nBASSOON MAINTENANCE AND CARE\n•  Carrying the bassoon should always be done with TWO hands--one on the boot joint\nand one around the wing and long joint. Never pick up the bassoon by the bell or the\nmiddle with one hand, because it could come apart and result in costly repair.\n•  Keep a supply of a dozen wisper key pads on hand. Students hit this pad with the\nbocal nub and they fall off frequently.\n•  Do not use clarinet or saxophone pads on the bassoon. They are made of different\nmaterials and are different heights and thicknesses and will drastically change the\npitch of the instrument. It is easy to order pad replacement kits from the Fox factory\nor any online double reed supplier.\n•  Students who have wooden bassoons should keep a lint-free cloth between the wing\nand long joints when storing the bassoon in its case. This will prevent damage to the\nwood of the wing joint and help keep the instrument in good working condition.\nIt is exceptionally important to swab wooden bassoons EVERY time they are played\nto prevent wood rot in the boot joint and keep the pads dry. Students should swab the\nwing joint and the boot joint with cotton swabs.\nIf a swab is stuck in the instrument, DO NOT PULL IT OUT. If you can extract it\nfrom the same direction it entered the instrument you will be able to safely remove it.\nRemember, the wing joint is smaller at the top (where the bocal is inserted) and wider\nat the bottom (where it enters the boot joint). Double reed suppliers sell swab\nextractors for this emergency.\n•  Suggested Repair Supplies:\no  Complete replacement set of pads from the Fox factory.\no  Wisper key pads (at least a dozen)\no  Plumbing tape\no  Swab extractor\no  Cork grease\nBASSOON-THE BOCAL\nBocal Care\n•  The bocal is the most fragile part of the instrument.\n•  Students must be taught to be protective of the bocal.\n•  Many schools that have good bassoons also have bent or broken bocals (cid:1) … which is\ncaused by students grabbing the straight part of the bocal during assembly/disassembly.\nTeachers should closely monitor students to make sure that bocals are not damaged.\n•  Most accidents cause bocals to become bent in the rounded part of the crook.\nIf a bassoon must be set down for any reason, it should never be laid on a chair… no\nmatter the design of the chair. It is best to stand the bassoon up in a corner at a slight\nangle, whether the floor is carpeted or not. This is the absolute best way to place an\nunattended bassoon.\n•  A bassoon should never be left on the ground or in a chair with the bocal inserted up in\nthe air.\n•  When a bassoon is left unattended or carried/moved from one place to another, the\nbocal should be placed in the bell… … NEVER IN THE WING JOINT OPENING!\n•  To clean the bocal, run hot soapy water and a bocal swab through the bocal on a monthly\nbasis.\nPitch and the Bocal\n•  A common misconception is that the pitch on a bassoon can be controlled with the length\nof the bocal; however, pitch on the bassoon is primarily controlled by the embouchure,\nairstream, and the size/shape of the reed.\n•  There is no affect on pitch by pulling out or pushing in the bocal.\n•  Professional bassoonists use shorter bocals (#1 instead of  #2) for playing in the extreme\nhigh register of the instrument. For example, a bassoonist may choose to use a #1 bocal to\nplay specific sections of the Rite of Spring by Stravinsky.\n•  Some common reed manufacturers use a reed shape that is too long and wide, which\ncreates a very flat and unfocused sound that no bocal can correct. If a student is having\npitch problems, they should work towards better embouchure flexibility and correct\nairstream, as well as experimenting with different reed styles.\nBocal Markings\n•  Most bocals have descriptive markings engraved into the surface that indicate the brand\nname and size.\n•  Fox bocals are only marked with “C”, “CVX”, or “CVC”……usually not with the name\nFox, but with the Fox logo/insignia.\n•  Heckel and Puchner bocals are inscribed with the manufacturer’s name. There are several\nbassoon makers that do not put markings of any type on the bocal.\n•  On most, if not all, Fox, Puchner and Heckel bocal lengths are indicated by the numbers\n“1”, “2”, or “3.”\nIt is highly recommended that most, if not all students, use a #2 bocal.\nBASSOON REEDS AND REED PREPARATION\nThe Reed\n•  The bassoon reed is a double reed made from cane called arundo donax that grows in\nthe Var region of France.\n•  Students should receive their reeds from a qualified bassoon instructor when possible.\n•  Students will not begin making their own reeds until the instructor is sure they are\nready for the task.\n•  Students will sound best if playing on reeds made by a qualified instructor. The\nquality of the reed will make a tremendous difference in the student’s ability to\ncontrol the instrument. Pitch problems and response/release problems in the extreme\nhigh and low registers may be caused by an inadequate reed. Access to many great\ndouble reed suppliers can be found online, and these companies have employees who\ncan provide competent advice regarding what kinds of reeds might be acceptable.\n•  The teacher must decide which vendor to use.\nReed Preparation\n•  Reeds should be stored in a safe case or box that allows for ventilation.\n•  Students should always have a pill bottle for water use during class. The bottles\nshould be emptied at the end of each class. Do not allow students to put bottles with\nwater inside their bassoon cases.\n•  The student will need to soak the reed in water for two to three minutes before\nplaying (one to two minutes in humid climates). The water should cover the entire\nreed.\n•  Always soak the reed with the tip down, so students do not smash the tip of the reed\nwith their fingers.\nIf the reed is too dry it will not vibrate correctly, and may crack.\n•  Students should eliminate excess water by blowing through the reed backwards.\n•  Put it in the reed case while assembling the instrument.\n•  Before playing, dip the reed into the water, blow through the end (butt) of the reed to\neliminate excess water.\n•  The tip opening should resemble: <>\no  Oval-shaped tips are not desired\no  If the tip is too open, students may close the tip with the pads of their fingers.\nThe reed must have been soaked before doing any slight adjustments.\no  Do not allow students to grab near the heart of the reed. This will damage\nthe reed.\no  Oil from the hands or nose can be rubbed on the reed to improve sound\nquality.\n•  Student can blow on the reed to check the quality. This is called “crowing.”\nBASSOON REED DIAGRAMS\nBASSOON EMBOUCHURE\n•  Students must be able to use air correctly before beginning to learn the\nbassoon embouchure.\n•  There should be no lines or dimples that do not appear in the natural face.  The face\nessentially should be “zombie” - like.\n•  Keep the body and face calm and still while learning this embouchure.\n•  The embouchure is non-structural and is a constant work in progress.\n•  The general formation of the mouth is such that the teeth and jaw are apart while\nholding the lips in the shape of the word “mo.”  The reed should be inserted in the\nmouth almost to the wire. If the blade is covered by the lips, you will hear less\nvibration of the reed or “buzz” in the sound; thus, the quality of the sound is\ncontrolled by combining the cushioning of the lips with STRONG AIR blown\nthrough the small opening of the reed.\n•  The following process should be taught to students:\no  Make a cushion with the bottom lip. Refrain from mentioning corners when\nfirst teaching the embouchure.\no  The texture of the lips should be soft and relaxed.\no  The reed should rest on the cushion created by the lower lip.\no  The reed touches where the wet and dry part of the lips meet. There should be\nno pressure on the bottom of the reed.\no  The upper lip moves “down and out” to meet the reed, which causes the jaw to\ndrop naturally.\no  The top lip should almost touch the wire.\n•  After  the  teacher  identifies  a  correct  embouchure/sound,  students  need  to  remember\nhow it feels and sounds.\n•  Be sure the student can control the air well enough to find the correct balance of\nair and resistance to create the desired sound.\n•  The bassoon embouchure is both internal and external. Many young players make the\nmistake of forming their mouth so that it can look deceptively accurate from the\noutside without holding their jaw correctly. This can be addressed with an exercise\ncalled the “donkey game” (this is attributed to Cheryl Huddleston, former bassoon\nprofessor at the University of Houston). The “donkey game” is as follows:\no  While fingering second space C, use the embouchure to drop the pitch down\nto second line B and back up the second space C.\no  This means that internally the student is vocalizing “eee / aw / eee.”\n•  The bassoon middle range resonates in the mask (the upper part of the face).\n•  While learning the embouchure, the tongue should sit in the bottom of the mouth.\n•  Most beginners play very flat because they do not know how to blow strong enough\nair. The incorrect tendency is to raise the pitch by biting or using the teeth to\nstrengthen the support of the lips. If the young bassoonist does not learn to blow\nstrong air and raise the pitch with good breath support, they will mature into players\nwho consistently play sharp and will have difficulty learning to play above the break.\nThis will become obvious when they must learn to play above the bass clef staff E\nand F.\nBASSOON ARTICULATION\n•  Do not attempt to teach articulation until all students are producing characteristic\nand consistent sounds on the instrument.\n•  Teach articulation using the bassoon.\n•  The tongue is down 98% and up 2% of the time.\n•  Have students say “luh luh,” without moving their corners.  Students should then\nidentify what part of the tongue actually moves.  The back of the tongue should\nstay  in  position  (for  voicing).    Use  this  method  to  touch  the  reed…..the  lower\nblade…..and tip area.\n•  When students articulate, start and continue doing it in 2’s—“luh luh” …….“duh\nduh”…..not  moving  their  corners.    Vocalize  and  then  perform  on  the  bassoon.\nRepeat this process.\n•  One  taste  bud  of  the  student’s  tongue  should  touch  the  bottom  blade  where  it\nmeets the tip.\n•  Remember the student must always touch and interrupt a vibrating reed.\n•  The articulation does not stop the reed vibration.\n•  All that moves when the student articulates is the air and part of the tongue.\n•  The tongue must touch in the same spot with the same energy every time.\n•  Start the vibration, and articulate as fast as the student is able in 2’s.\n•  Start the vibration, and then articulate with the snapped finger on command.\n•  When  pulse  and  foot  pat  are  learned,  articulate  every  time  the  foot  touches  the\nfloor.\n•  Then articulate when the foot touches the floor and as it comes up.\n•  Once  the  student  is  able  to  read  music,  call  the  articulation  “rhythmic\narticulation.”\n•  Every  day  articulate  as  fast  as  the  student  can,  use  the  “luh  luh”….“duh  duh”\nmethod, articulate on command, articulate with foot pat and articulate rhythms.\n•  When the tongue is moving correctly, begin to coordinate finger movement with\nthe articulation.\nBASSOON – EVEN EXERCISE\nThe “Even Exercise” is to instill even technique during the early stages of learning the\n•  Students must think “squeeze, release” throughout the exercise.\n•  This should be taught without using music at first and without a written rhythm.\nInstead, use the phrase “I must do this exercise” to express the rhythm.\n•  As presented on this page, use note names before using notes in the staff. This\nallows the student to easily think “squeeze, release” and perform correct finger\nmovement.\nBASSOON EVEN EXERCISE PATTERNS\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\nE   F    E   F    E   F    E\n“I must do this ex- er- cise.”\nD    E    D   E    D   E   D\nC    D    C   D    C   D  C\nBb  C   Bb  C    Bb  C  Bb\nBb  A   Bb  A    Bb  A  Bb\nG    A    G   A    G    A   G\nF     G    F   G     F    G    F\n•  On the following page, the exercises are the same except for the fact that the\nnotes are on a musical staff.\n(continued)\n•  Use note names before using notes in the staff.

The “donkey game” is as follows:\no  While fingering second space C, use the embouchure to drop the pitch down\nto second line B and back up the second space C.\no  This means that internally the student is vocalizing “eee / aw / eee.”\n•  The bassoon middle range resonates in the mask (the upper part of the face).\n•  While learning the embouchure, the tongue should sit in the bottom of the mouth.\n•  Most beginners play very flat because they do not know how to blow strong enough\nair. The incorrect tendency is to raise the pitch by biting or using the teeth to\nstrengthen the support of the lips. If the young bassoonist does not learn to blow\nstrong air and raise the pitch with good breath support, they will mature into players\nwho consistently play sharp and will have difficulty learning to play above the break.\nThis will become obvious when they must learn to play above the bass clef staff E\nand F."

    "text": "BASSOON ARTICULATION\n•  Do not attempt to teach articulation until all students are producing characteristic\nand consistent sounds on the instrument.\n•  Teach articulation using the bassoon.\n•  The tongue is down 98% and up 2% of the time.\n•  Have students say “luh luh,” without moving their corners.  Students should then\nidentify what part of the tongue actually moves.  The back of the tongue should\nstay  in  position  (for  voicing).    Use  this  method  to  touch  the  reed…..the  lower\nblade…..and tip area.\n•  When students articulate, start and continue doing it in 2’s—“luh luh” …….“duh\nduh”…..not  moving  their  corners.    Vocalize  and  then  perform  on  the  bassoon.\nRepeat this process.\n•  One  taste  bud  of  the  student’s  tongue  should  touch  the  bottom  blade  where  it\nmeets the tip.\n•  Remember the student must always touch and interrupt a vibrating reed.\n•  The articulation does not stop the reed vibration.\n•  All that moves when the student articulates is the air and part of the tongue.\n•  The tongue must touch in the same spot with the same energy every time.\n•  Start the vibration, and articulate as fast as the student is able in 2’s.\n•  Start the vibration, and then articulate with the snapped finger on command.\n•  When  pulse  and  foot  pat  are  learned,  articulate  every  time  the  foot  touches  the\nfloor.\n•  Then articulate when the foot touches the floor and as it comes up.\n•  Once  the  student  is  able  to  read  music,  call  the  articulation  “rhythmic\narticulation.”\n•  Every  day  articulate  as  fast  as  the  student  can,  use  the  “luh  luh”….“duh  duh”\nmethod, articulate on command, articulate with foot pat and articulate rhythms.\n•  When the tongue is moving correctly, begin to coordinate finger movement with\nthe articulation."

    "text": "BASSOON-THE BOCAL\nBocal Care\n•  The bocal is the most fragile part of the instrument.\n•  Students must be taught to be protective of the bocal.\n•  Many schools that have good bassoons also have bent or broken bocals (cid:1) … which is\ncaused by students grabbing the straight part of the bocal during assembly/disassembly.\nTeachers should closely monitor students to make sure that bocals are not damaged.\n•  Most accidents cause bocals to become bent in the rounded part of the crook.\n•\nIf a bassoon must be set down for any reason, it should never be laid on a chair… no\nmatter the design of the chair. It is best to stand the bassoon up in a corner at a slight\nangle, whether the floor is carpeted or not. This is the absolute best way to place an\nunattended bassoon.\n•  A bassoon should never be left on the ground or in a chair with the bocal inserted up in\nthe air.\n•  When a bassoon is left unattended or carried/moved from one place to another, the\nbocal should be placed in the bell… … NEVER IN THE WING JOINT OPENING!\n•  To clean the bocal, run hot soapy water and a bocal swab through the bocal on a monthly\nbasis.\nPitch and the Bocal\n•  A common misconception is that the pitch on a bassoon can be controlled with the length\nof the bocal; however, pitch on the bassoon is primarily controlled by the embouchure,\nairstream, and the size/shape of the reed.\n•  There is no affect on pitch by pulling out or pushing in the bocal.\n•  Professional bassoonists use shorter bocals (#1 instead of  #2) for playing in the extreme\nhigh register of the instrument. For example, a bassoonist may choose to use a #1 bocal to\nplay specific sections of the Rite of Spring by Stravinsky.\n•  Some common reed manufacturers use a reed shape that is too long and wide, which\ncreates a very flat and unfocused sound that no bocal can correct. If a student is having\npitch problems, they should work towards better embouchure flexibility and correct\nairstream, as well as experimenting with different reed styles.\nBocal Markings\n•  Most bocals have descriptive markings engraved into the surface that indicate the brand\nname and size.\n•  Fox bocals are only marked with “C”, “CVX”, or “CVC”……usually not with the name\nFox, but with the Fox logo/insignia.\n•  Heckel and Puchner bocals are inscribed with the manufacturer’s name. There are several\nbassoon makers that do not put markings of any type on the bocal.\n•  On most, if not all, Fox, Puchner and Heckel bocal lengths are indicated by the numbers\n“1”, “2”, or “3.”\nIt is highly recommended that most, if not all students, use a #2 bocal."

Identify these marks,\nand their relationship to the top and bottom of the case. Most cases have the handles\nplaced on the bottom section of each case. Check to make sure.\n•  Place all cases on the floor in front of the student.\n•  Be sure the student understands where each part of the instrument belongs in the case.\nGive detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make sure the student\nwaits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure the parts of the\ninstrument are returned to the case in the reverse order they were removed.\n•  All instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure explicitly\nevery time.\n•  Never leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up, but this is\nnot always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.  Check each\nopening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to your students.\n•  Cases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe place in the classroom setup\nfor each student’s case.\nInstrument Assembly\n•  Place the open case on the floor in front of the student.\n•  Pick up the boot joint with your left hand. Refer to the attached descriptive picture of\nthe parts of the bassoon.\n•  Pick up the wing joint with your right hand.\n•\nInsert the wing joint into the smaller hole at the top of the boot joint. There may be\nslight markings at the top of the boot and the bottom of the wing, which can be\naligned to insure the parts are together correctly (the rounded parts will match).\n•  Pick up the long joint and insert into the large hole of the boot joint so that the metal\nblock in the middle meets the protruding middle of the wing joint. The long joint may\nhave a body lock that can slide into the wing joint.\n•  Slide the bell onto the top of the bassoon so that the extensions of the Bb key meet\neach other.\n•  Students having trouble with assembling or disassembling the instrument should try\ntwisting back and forth before they pull.\n•  The most fragile part of the bassoon is the bocal. Care must be taken to gently hold\nthe bocal on top of the rounded part of the crook (not the long slender portion).\nGently wiggle the bocal back and forth to insert into the top of the wing joint but\navoid colliding with the whisper key pad. Align the nub of the bocal with the whisper\nkey pad. Refer to the handout regarding specific information about the bocal.\nIf the student wishes to use a crutch, insert the crutch into the hole on the boot joint.\nIf the crutch causes the student’s hand position to be too high to activate the pinky\nkeys, the student should learn to balance the instrument without using the crutch;\notherwise, the crutch may be used at the discretion of the player.\nInstrument/Body Ratio\n•  Familiarize the student with the instrument/body ratio by using the instrument\nwithout the reed.\n•  The left hand should gently hold and eventually balance the wing joint in the same\nmanner used to assemble the instrument--without putting pressure on the long keys.\n•  The right hand should balance the long joint in the same manner used to assemble the\ninstrument.\n•  Familiarize the student in this manner for a few days before placing the fingers in\ntheir correct position."

Most cases have the handles placed on the bottom section\nof each case.  Check to make sure.\n•  Place all cases on the floor in front of the student, or on a large table in the\ncorrect position.  Flute and oboe cases are more easily opened from the top of a\nlarge table.\n•  Be sure the student understands where each part of the instrument belongs in\nthe case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make\nsure the student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure\nthe parts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse order they\nwere removed.\n•  All instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure\nexplicitly every time.\n•  Never leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up,\nbut this is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.\nCheck each opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to\nyour students.\n•  Cases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe place in the classroom\nsetup for each student’s case.\nIdentifying Parts of the Oboe and Removing It Safely From Its Case\n•  Look at the case in relation to the parts of the oboe.  Most cases are molded to\nthe shape of a particular part.  Be specific when making this point to your\nstudents.  Take your time, and repeat the information many times.  Notice that\nthe keys will be facing up when placed correctly in the case.  Damage will\noccur if the parts are placed incorrectly in the case.\nIf the metal keys on the oboe are cold, the student must warm them with the\nhands.\n•\n•  A cold oboe with warm air going through it might crack.\n•  Once the case information is understood, place the case on a flat surface.\nNever let the student place the case in his lap.\n•  Open the case from its correct position.  Remember, most latches will lift up.\nSome oboe cases have the buttons that slide side to side.\n•  The oboe has an upper and lower joint, and a bell.\nIdentify the lower joint:  there are three keys similar to the four clarinet keys at\nthe end of the joint\nIdentify the upper joint:  there are two octave keys that must be identified by\nthe instructor.\n•  SEND SEGMENTS OF THIS INFORMATION HOME TO PARENTS.\nCHOOSE THE INFORMATION YOU THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL\nFOR HOME PRACTICE AND INSTRUMENT CARE.\nInstrument Assembly\n•  BE VERY SPECIFIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n•  Corks must be prepared as with the clarinet and saxophone.  Follow the same\nprocedure as discussed in the handouts for those instruments.\n•  Turn hand so that the back of the oboe joints face the student.  It is easy to\nidentify which keys that align.\n•  Slide the left hand down to the lower joint, and pick up the bell with the right\nhand.\n•  Push and twist the bell and lower joint together.  Be careful not to touch a rod.\n•  Place the upper joint in the left hand with the palm toward the ceiling.\n•  Twist and push the upper joint onto lower joint and bell with the palm of the right\nhand toward the floor.\n•  Line up the rods on the right side of the instrument.  Be careful not to damage the\nbridge keys.  Many repetitions are necessary to insure no damage is done.\n•  The oboe is disassembled in the opposite manner it is assembled, and the parts are\nplaced in their correct positions in the case.\n•  The case is closed and latched.\nInstrument/Body Ratio\n•  Familiarize the student with the instrument/body ratio by using the instrument\nwithout the reed.\n•  The left hand should gently hold the upper joint in the same manner used to\nassemble the instrument--without putting pressure on the long keys.\n•  The right hand should hold the lower joint in the same manner used to assemble\nthe instrument--without putting pressure on the long keys.\n•  Move the instrument up and down, side to side by using the elbows.  Students are\nmerely getting used to the weight of the instrument; the position of the\ninstrument; and the angle of the instrument without using correct hand position.\nThe student should not squeeze the instrument as these exercises are practiced.\nKeep the palms of the hands soft.\n•  Familiarize the student in this manner for a few days before placing the fingers in\ntheir correct position."

    "text": "CHARACTERISTICS WHEN RECRUITING AND\nSELECTING OBOE AND BASSOON PLAYERS\nGeneral Physical Characteristics for Oboe and Bassoon\n  Students having overbites are fine; however, underbites are not recommended.\n  The length of tissue from the bottom of the nose to the bottom of the upper lip\nmust be long. This is vital in order to achieve the desired double reed\nembouchure.\n  Check to see if the student’s lips line up with their teeth.\n  Students should have high cheek bones.\n  Students should have developed thighs to better balance and support the\ndiaphragm area in order to achieve a more mature and resonant tone quality.\n  Students with well-defined hands will have better finger dexterity.\n  Avoid recruiting students on double reed instruments that are double-jointed.\nAdditional Physical Characteristics for Oboe\n  Students recruited to play oboe need to have long enough fingers to cover the\nmiddle holes of keys.\n  Students should have a larger stretch between their right hand thumb and pinky, in\norder to activate all of the necessary bottom keys.\nAdditional Physical Characteristics for Bassoon\n  Students recruited to play bassoon need to have a large stretch between their left\nhand thumb and middle finger, in order to eventually be able to activate all of the\nnecessary thumb keys.\n\nIdeally, students recruited to play bassoon need to be taller and have long arms.\n  Students recruited to play bassoon need to have big enough hands to reach around\nthe bassoon.\nNon-Physical Characteristics\n  Students need to have a genuine interest in the instrument.  Since it is challenging\nto find 5th grade students who want to play the oboe or bassoon, make sure that\nyou successfully represent these instruments at your 5th grade recruiting concert.\nwww.johnbenzer.com\n  Students must score in the higher percentile on the musical aptitude test you\nadminister (if applicable).  At the very least, strive to select students that have\ngood ears.\n  Specific to oboe, select students who will not be afraid to be heard.\n  Students recruited need to be passionate about music in general.\n  Parents of perspective double reed students need to be very pro-active and/or\ninvolved.\n  Students recruited to play double reed instruments need to be academically strong,\nresponsible and be overachievers.\n  Piano background is a plus--but cannot/should not be required.\n  Students officially recruited to play double reed instruments need to show\ncommitment for the duration of their middle school/junior high band experience\n(3 years).\nMiscellaneous\n  Be cautious about putting all Asian students on double reed instruments (for\nfuture academic reasons).\n  Be cautious of putting your only tall boys on bassoon, especially if they express\ninterest in athletics down the road.\n  You are recommended in starting oboes in groups of 3 or 4 students—and\nbassoons in groups of 3 or 4 students---as opposed to starting only 2 (in the event\nthat 1 student quits at the semester or end of the year, etc.).\n  Do not have students switch from oboe to bassoon or vice versa.  You need to be\ncertain that you are putting the right student on the right instrument from the\nbeginning!\nGETTING YOUR DOUBLE REED CLASS STARTED\n  During your beginner drives, inform the oboe and bassoon parents that their children\nwere “hand picked”, and that it is a special privilege to be selected for the double reed\nclass—the smallest beginning class taught.  With that said, you would like to get the\nstudents started in a separate oboe and bassoon classes—with an oboe/bassoon\nspecialist—before the official start of the school year.\nIn order to alleviate potential vacation conflicts during the summer, you are\nrecommended to schedule these classes the week before school starts—or at the very\nleast in early to mid-August.\n  Do not schedule, for example, your oboe class at the same time as your bassoon class.\nEach class should meet separately, even though they will be combined during the actual\nclass period throughout the school year.\n  It is vital that the teacher of record be present in all of these classes.  This instructor\nshould not schedule anything else during this time (i.e. inservice meetings/trainings,\nparent meetings, etc.).  Detailed notes should be taken in regard to everything being\nsaid and done by the specialists while they are working with YOUR students!\n  To get the most out of these classes, try to schedule 3-4 classes for 1 hour.  The time of\nday should be determined after finding out how the students will get to your school—\neither by walking or a getting a ride from their parents.\n  Create a flyer that includes the tentative dates, tentative times, cost, instructor name, etc.\nThese flyers need to be given to the parents at the drive.  Indicate on the flyer that the\nparents are invited to attend the very last class to meet the instructor.\n  After all of your recruited double reed students have “come through” your instrument\ndrive(s), call each parent to confirm that they have no conflicts with the dates and times\nof the classes.  If there are conflicts with even 1 student, try your best to move the classes\nto dates/times where everyone can be present.\n  Students and parents need to understand that once school starts, the oboes and bassoons\nwill be in the same beginner class daily.\n  Students should be charged a private lesson cost for each class (i.e. $15 X 4 classes =\n$60.  Make sure the parents understand that this is NOT a weekly cost during the\nschool year—unless of course the student is taking private lessons.\nIn addition to the payments collected by the students, you need to offer the specialists a\nmileage surcharge, as well as lunch/dinner if applicable.\n  Make sure that your music store road man delivers the oboe and maintenance kits in\nplenty of time for the first class; especially the reeds.\n  Make sure you have instruments assigned for each oboe and bassoon student.  If these\ninstruments were sent to the repair shop during the summer, ask your road man to ensure\ntheir completion—and delivery—in plenty of time for the first class.\n  During the actual week of summer classes, send out a reminder invitation for the parents\nto attend the very last class.  On this day, you need to have private lesson forms ready to\npass out.\nIntroduce the specialists to the parents during the last class.  Explain to the parents how\nfortunate the students were to have a specialist working with their children.  If the\nspecialist happens to be your campus private lesson instructor as well, inform the\nparents of this as well!\n  Explain the benefits of your private lesson program and distribute private lesson forms.\nReiterate that the payment they made for the summer classes would be equivalent to an\nentire MONTH of private lessons, and that most months would have 3-4 lesson dates.\n  Make arrangements to have payments ready for the specialists at the conclusion of the\nlast summer class.\n  The better you treat your specialists (more specifically if this specialist is also your\ncampus private lesson instructor), the more likely they are to make homemade reeds for\nyour students after they have “gone through” their first 3-4 store-bought reeds that were\nincluded in their maintenance kits.\n  Attempt to book the specialists/private lesson instructors as much in advance as possible\nfor the next summer.\n  You are highly discouraged from moving students from other woodwind instruments\nthat they have already been playing (flute or a single reed instrument)…….. to oboe and\nbassoon.  Try very hard to find students that would excel on double reed instruments\nfrom the beginning!  If you have physical oboes and bassoons in your inventory, USE\nTHEM!!    There are, however, exceptions; for example, you may have a student that is\njust not “getting it” on another instrument……….or you may have a move-in student that\nmay have been recruited to play oboe or bassoon at their previous school, but you may be\napprehensive about that decision and want to re-test them on other instruments.\n  Factors that must be considered when moving a student from another instrument—that\nthey have already been playing—to a double reed instrument:\no  size of the case may be significantly different\no  reed costs (if moving from clarinet or saxophone)\no  new maintenance kit needed\no  returning the previous instrument to the music store (if it was being rented)\no\nthe student possibly having to read a different clef\n  Positive factors that must be considered when moving a student to a double reed\ninstrument:\nthe double reed class will be the smallest homogeneous class in your band\nprogram; therefore, students will receive more attention\no  because the class is smaller, it will move faster than their previous class\no  no monthly rental cost of the instrument because it is now school-owned"

Most cases have the handles placed on the bottom section\nof each case.  Check to make sure.\n•  Place all cases on the floor in front of the student, or on a large table in the\ncorrect position.  Flute and oboe cases are more easily opened from the top of a\nlarge table.\n•  Be sure the student understands where each part of the instrument belongs in\nthe case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make\nsure the student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure\nthe parts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse order they\nwere removed.\n•  All instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure\nexplicitly every time.\n•  Never leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up,\nbut this is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.\nCheck each opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to\nyour students.\n•  Cases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe place in the classroom\nsetup for each student’s case.\nIdentifying Parts of the Oboe and Removing It Safely From Its Case\n•  Look at the case in relation to the parts of the oboe.  Most cases are molded to\nthe shape of a particular part.  Be specific when making this point to your\nstudents.  Take your time, and repeat the information many times.  Notice that\nthe keys will be facing up when placed correctly in the case.  Damage will\noccur if the parts are placed incorrectly in the case.\nIf the metal keys on the oboe are cold, the student must warm them with the\nhands.\n•\n•  A cold oboe with warm air going through it might crack.\n•  Once the case information is understood, place the case on a flat surface.\nNever let the student place the case in his lap.\n•  Open the case from its correct position.  Remember, most latches will lift up.\nSome oboe cases have the buttons that slide side to side.\n•  The oboe has an upper and lower joint, and a bell.\nIdentify the lower joint:  there are three keys similar to the four clarinet keys at\nthe end of the joint\nIdentify the upper joint:  there are two octave keys that must be identified by\nthe instructor.\n•  SEND SEGMENTS OF THIS INFORMATION HOME TO PARENTS.\nCHOOSE THE INFORMATION YOU THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL\nFOR HOME PRACTICE AND INSTRUMENT CARE.\nInstrument Assembly\n•  BE VERY SPECIFIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n•  Corks must be prepared as with the clarinet and saxophone.  Follow the same\nprocedure as discussed in the handouts for those instruments.\n•  Turn hand so that the back of the oboe joints face the student.  It is easy to\nidentify which keys that align.\n•  Slide the left hand down to the lower joint, and pick up the bell with the right\nhand.\n•  Push and twist the bell and lower joint together.  Be careful not to touch a rod.\n•  Place the upper joint in the left hand with the palm toward the ceiling.\n•  Twist and push the upper joint onto lower joint and bell with the palm of the right\nhand toward the floor.\n•  Line up the rods on the right side of the instrument.  Be careful not to damage the\nbridge keys.  Many repetitions are necessary to insure no damage is done.\n•  The oboe is disassembled in the opposite manner it is assembled, and the parts are\nplaced in their correct positions in the case.\n•  The case is closed and latched.\nInstrument/Body Ratio\n•  Familiarize the student with the instrument/body ratio by using the instrument\nwithout the reed.\n•  The left hand should gently hold the upper joint in the same manner used to\nassemble the instrument--without putting pressure on the long keys.\n•  The right hand should hold the lower joint in the same manner used to assemble\nthe instrument--without putting pressure on the long keys.\n•  Move the instrument up and down, side to side by using the elbows.  Students are\nmerely getting used to the weight of the instrument; the position of the\ninstrument; and the angle of the instrument without using correct hand position.\nThe student should not squeeze the instrument as these exercises are practiced.\nKeep the palms of the hands soft.\n•  Familiarize the student in this manner for a few days before placing the fingers in\ntheir correct position.\nMiddle / Heart\nBark\nOBOE REED DIAGRAM\nTip\nSpine\nBack  / Windows\nThread\nCreated by Kyle Pastor\nOBOE REEDS AND REED PREPARATION\nThe Reed\n•  The oboe reed is a double reed made from cane called arundo donax that grows in\nthe Var region of France.\n•  The cane is split, gouged, shaped, profiled and tied on a tube with a piece of\nstring.\n•  Students should receive their reeds from a qualified oboe instructor when\npossible.\n•  The student will not begin making their own reeds until the instructor is sure they\nare ready for the task.\n•  Commercial reeds are available through several companies, and the teacher must\nmake the decision on the vendor.\nReed Preparation\n•  Reeds should be stored in a safe case or box that allows for ventilation.\n•  Students should use a reed holder that is durable and watertight.

This is called “crowing”.\nOBOE HAND POSITION\nRight Hand Position\n1.  Place the right hand first, with the lower joint and bell supported by the\nleg.  The upper joint can be gently held by the left hand as you begin the\nawkward process of finding the correct place for every finger.\n2.  Place the fleshy finger pads over the keys first.  Without putting pressure\non the finger tips, be sure all holes are covered.\n3.  The hand will begin in a straight across angle, and will be in the “flat-C”\nposition.  Eventually, as with the clarinet, they will slant into the “V”\nposition.\n4.  Place the thumb on the thumb rest between the rest and the leg.  The\nthumb nail touches the rest. Very little (preferably, no) flesh will touch the\nthumb rest. The thumb joint must always be to the right of the thumb rest,\nnever behind it.\n5.  Turn the oboe out in front of the student like a spyglass and make sure\nthere is open space between the body of the oboe and the hand.\n6.  The little finger rests on the most comfortable home key it will use later in\nthis process.\n7.  The middle finger will appear higher because it is longer than the other\nfingers.\n8.  The middle finger should be very close to perpendicular to the joint.\n9.  No part of any finger should touch any rod.\n10. Practice moving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.  Do not\nlet the other two knuckles move.  The finger pads should fall directly into\nthe holes.  In the beginning the little finger can move up and down also.\n11. Lean the oboe back on the shoulder and look at the right hand fingers as\nyou do this.  While doing this, the left hand must remain in its proper\n“baby” position holding the upper joint.\n12. Saying “squeeze….release” for finger movement will help the fingers\nmove from the big knuckles and understand the “timing” of fingers.\n13. Make sure to feel all parts of the keys with the finger pads.\n14. Do not include side keys in the initial hand position information.  When\nasked by students,  tell them once the hands can move using the keys\ncorrectly, they will be allowed to use the keys on the side.\nLeft Hand Position\n1.  ALWAYS KEEP ONE HAND ON THE OBOE AT ALL TIMES.\nNEVER SIMPLY LAY IT IN THE LAP.\n2.  Keep the thumb perpendicular to the back of the instrument.\n3.  The middle knuckle of the index finger is placed over one of the octave\nkeys.\n4.  The fingers are slightly slanted downward.\n5.  Place the index, middle, and ring fingers on the keys with holes.\n6.  Beginners can have “fly-away” fingers in the beginning as long as they\nfall back down to the correct rings.  Always feel the palm of the hands to\ncheck for the softness of the fingers.  There are more bones in this area of\nthe hand than any other part of the body.  If the palm is soft, all other parts\nof the hand will be as naturally soft as is possible.  The little fingers should\nhave comfortable “home keys” they touch all of the time in the beginning\nstages.\n7.  Be patient with progress toward absolute correct hand position.  It is best\nto have “double jointed” students not play the oboe.\n8.  The body of the oboe is very small.  Hand position can feel very awkward.\nThe student should be made aware of the oboe’s double octave key system,\nand that the middle finger will appear higher because it is longer than the\nother fingers.\n10. Using the previously mentioned “squeeze….release” exercises, practice\nmoving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.  Do not let the\nother two knuckles move.  The finger pads should fall directly into the\nholes.  In the beginning the little finger can move up and down also.\n11. Make sure to feel all parts of the keys with the finger pads.\n12. Do not include side keys in the initial hand position information.  When\nasked, tell students once their hands can move using the keys correctly,\nthey will be allowed to use the keys on the side.\nFinger Exercises\n1.  All fingers in each hand move together.  Call out the hand you wish to\nmove.  The students move all of the fingers in that hand down to seat into\nthe rings and tone holes.  The right hand thumb obviously does not ever\nmove when the teacher asks for “RIGHT,” but the left hand thumb can\nmove with the fingers of the left hand when needed as the teacher asks for\n“LEFT.”\n2.  Next, we move the fingers one at a time beginning with the left hand.  The\nthumb and first finger are already down in this exercise, and each\nadditional finger in both hands will be numbered two through six from top\nof the upper joint to the bottom of the lower joint. The fingers will move\ndown or up depending on their starting position, as the number is called by\nthe teacher.  We do not use the little fingers when we first begin this\nexercise.  Later, they will be numbered seven and eight.\n3.  Watch the fingers to see that they move smoothly, cover the holes, stay in\nnatural position and move up and down from the big knuckle only.\n4.  Next, we move the fingers in combinations: one, two….one, two\nthree…….one, two, three, four……one, two, three, four, five…..one, two,\nthree, four, five, six………six, five, four, three, two, one……five, four,\nthree, two, one…….four, three, two, one……three, two, one………two,\none……  Later in the development the thumb movement is added.\n5.  Using these exercises, the fingers move in all of the ways they move to\nplay the oboe: all together, one at a time, and in combinations.\n6.  When learning to use the little fingers, number the keys.  The teacher calls\nout the number, and the student moves the little finger in either hand in a\ncircular motion to the numbered key.  Call the numbers in order: call the\nnumbers backward: call the numbers diagonally: call the numbers in any\norder you wish.\nOBOE EMBOUCHURE\n•  Students must be able to use air correctly before beginning to learn the oboe\nembouchure.  The balance of air to the resistance of the reed and instrument is\nvery important for the oboe (possibly more than any other woodwind\ninstrument).\n•  The oboe embouchure is supported by the lips: not the teeth.\n•  The lips must be dry.\n•  The reed is soaked, but before playing, blow the excess water through the staple.\n•  Place the reed one half onto the fleshy part of the lower lip.\n•  Close the lower lip\n•  Keep the teeth open and away from the lips in the “oo” position.\n•  The lips should “pucker” around the reed with the corners forward.\n•  Push the reed slightly toward the lips.\n•  The tips of the blades must be past the lips, and into the chamber of the mouth.\nBoth blades of the reed must be allowed to vibrate freely.  Only the tip should be\ninside of the mouth—approximately ¼ inch.\n•  The reed will sound or “crow” a “C” when used without the instrument.\n•  Keep the body and face calm and still while learning the embouchure.\n•  Watch the student’s face.  A natural look within the adjustments for the\nembouchure is desired.  All aspects of other reed instrument embouchure/face\nrelationships hold true for the oboe.\n•  The embouchure is a work in progress.  The adjustment of the amount of reed\ninto the chamber will be determined by the resonance of the sound.\n•  When playing the oboe, air has a tendency to “back up” in the student’s body.\nThe student should exhale on rests and inhale with new air.\nOBOE ARTICULATION\n•  Do not attempt to teach articulation until all students are producing characteristic\nand consistent sounds on the instrument.\n•  Teach articulation using the oboe.\n•  The tongue is down 98% and up 2% of the time.\n•  Have students say “luh luh,” without moving their corners.

    "text": "OBOE HAND POSITION\nRight Hand Position\n1.  Place the right hand first, with the lower joint and bell supported by the\nleg.  The upper joint can be gently held by the left hand as you begin the\nawkward process of finding the correct place for every finger.\n2.  Place the fleshy finger pads over the keys first.  Without putting pressure\non the finger tips, be sure all holes are covered.\n3.  The hand will begin in a straight across angle, and will be in the “flat-C”\nposition.  Eventually, as with the clarinet, they will slant into the “V”\nposition.\n4.  Place the thumb on the thumb rest between the rest and the leg.  The\nthumb nail touches the rest. Very little (preferably, no) flesh will touch the\nthumb rest. The thumb joint must always be to the right of the thumb rest,\nnever behind it.\n5.  Turn the oboe out in front of the student like a spyglass and make sure\nthere is open space between the body of the oboe and the hand.\n6.  The little finger rests on the most comfortable home key it will use later in\nthis process.\n7.  The middle finger will appear higher because it is longer than the other\nfingers.\n8.  The middle finger should be very close to perpendicular to the joint.\n9.  No part of any finger should touch any rod.\n10. Practice moving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.  Do not\nlet the other two knuckles move.  The finger pads should fall directly into\nthe holes.  In the beginning the little finger can move up and down also.\n11. Lean the oboe back on the shoulder and look at the right hand fingers as\nyou do this.  While doing this, the left hand must remain in its proper\n“baby” position holding the upper joint.\n12. Saying “squeeze….release” for finger movement will help the fingers\nmove from the big knuckles and understand the “timing” of fingers.\n13. Make sure to feel all parts of the keys with the finger pads.\n14. Do not include side keys in the initial hand position information.  When\nasked by students,  tell them once the hands can move using the keys\ncorrectly, they will be allowed to use the keys on the side.\nLeft Hand Position\n1.  ALWAYS KEEP ONE HAND ON THE OBOE AT ALL TIMES.\nNEVER SIMPLY LAY IT IN THE LAP.\n2.  Keep the thumb perpendicular to the back of the instrument.\n3.  The middle knuckle of the index finger is placed over one of the octave\nkeys.\n4.  The fingers are slightly slanted downward.\n5.  Place the index, middle, and ring fingers on the keys with holes.\n6.  Beginners can have “fly-away” fingers in the beginning as long as they\nfall back down to the correct rings.  Always feel the palm of the hands to\ncheck for the softness of the fingers.  There are more bones in this area of\nthe hand than any other part of the body.  If the palm is soft, all other parts\nof the hand will be as naturally soft as is possible.  The little fingers should\nhave comfortable “home keys” they touch all of the time in the beginning\nstages.\n7.  Be patient with progress toward absolute correct hand position.  It is best\nto have “double jointed” students not play the oboe.\n8.  The body of the oboe is very small.  Hand position can feel very awkward.\nThe student should be made aware of the oboe’s double octave key system,\nand that the middle finger will appear higher because it is longer than the\nother fingers.\n10. Using the previously mentioned “squeeze….release” exercises, practice\nmoving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.  Do not let the\nother two knuckles move.  The finger pads should fall directly into the\nholes.  In the beginning the little finger can move up and down also.\n11. Make sure to feel all parts of the keys with the finger pads.\n12. Do not include side keys in the initial hand position information.  When\nasked, tell students once their hands can move using the keys correctly,\nthey will be allowed to use the keys on the side.\nFinger Exercises\n1.  All fingers in each hand move together.  Call out the hand you wish to\nmove.  The students move all of the fingers in that hand down to seat into\nthe rings and tone holes.  The right hand thumb obviously does not ever\nmove when the teacher asks for “RIGHT,” but the left hand thumb can\nmove with the fingers of the left hand when needed as the teacher asks for\n“LEFT.”\n2.  Next, we move the fingers one at a time beginning with the left hand.  The\nthumb and first finger are already down in this exercise, and each\nadditional finger in both hands will be numbered two through six from top\nof the upper joint to the bottom of the lower joint. The fingers will move\ndown or up depending on their starting position, as the number is called by\nthe teacher.  We do not use the little fingers when we first begin this\nexercise.  Later, they will be numbered seven and eight.\n3.  Watch the fingers to see that they move smoothly, cover the holes, stay in\nnatural position and move up and down from the big knuckle only.\n4.  Next, we move the fingers in combinations: one, two….one, two\nthree…….one, two, three, four……one, two, three, four, five…..one, two,\nthree, four, five, six………six, five, four, three, two, one……five, four,\nthree, two, one…….four, three, two, one……three, two, one………two,\none……  Later in the development the thumb movement is added.\n5.  Using these exercises, the fingers move in all of the ways they move to\nplay the oboe: all together, one at a time, and in combinations.\n6.  When learning to use the little fingers, number the keys.  The teacher calls\nout the number, and the student moves the little finger in either hand in a\ncircular motion to the numbered key.  Call the numbers in order: call the\nnumbers backward: call the numbers diagonally: call the numbers in any\norder you wish."

Only the tip should be\ninside of the mouth—approximately ¼ inch.\n•  The reed will sound or “crow” a “C” when used without the instrument.\n•  Keep the body and face calm and still while learning the embouchure.\n•  Watch the student’s face.  A natural look within the adjustments for the\nembouchure is desired.  All aspects of other reed instrument embouchure/face\nrelationships hold true for the oboe.\n•  The embouchure is a work in progress.  The adjustment of the amount of reed\ninto the chamber will be determined by the resonance of the sound.\n•  When playing the oboe, air has a tendency to “back up” in the student’s body.\nThe student should exhale on rests and inhale with new air."

    "text": "SOAKING, BREAKING IN AND ADJUSTING REEDS\nSoaking Reeds\nSoak/break in the very first reed…. for several minutes…. together in class while the teacher is closely monitoring the students.  Following this process, the teacher should assign three additional reeds to be broken in for homework.  With that said, reed guards should be going home with students each and every day—whether or not the entire instrument is going home.\nRemove the reed from the plastic reed holder.  The left hand should hold the plastic reed holder, with the thumb on the reed guard logo.  The right hand thumb and index finger should carefully slide the reed out of the plastic reed holder, with the tip coming out first.\nHold the reed with the thumb on the words and the index finger on the back.\nLay the reed on the tongue.  Talk to students about the unusual taste of the reed, and assure them that with time, this process will become second nature.\nDraw the tongue in.  The teeth should not have any contact with the reed.\nPlace the reed in the mouth to moisten and smooth the top and bottom of it.  Moistening the bottom (butt) of the reed helps create a seal around the mouthpiece, which will result in better response.\nFlatten the tip of the reed by putting the side with words on the table (flat part of the mouthpiece).  Place the thumb on the on the tip of the reed, (which is now on the table) and wiggle the reed back and forth to get any warps out.  This helps with over-all reed vibration.\nVacuum reeds at the end of class (have students suck air through the mouthpiece to eliminate water on the reed).\nAt the end of each class period/practice session, suck the air through the mouthpiece to eliminate water on the reed.  Reeds can now be “vacuumed” by carefully removing the reed through the lips.  Reeds can furthermore be blotted on shorts/jeans/etc.  This will eliminate excessive saliva to remain on the reed…which will eventually mold if not vacuumed.\nWith the plastic reed holder held in the same manner as discussed in #1, carefully slide the butt of the reed into the reed guard first, so that the tip is not destroyed.\nBreaking in Reeds\nThere are two specific reasons why breaking in reeds is important:\nso reeds last longer\nso students will always have reeds on hand\nThere is a process involved to properly and effectively break in a reed:\nBreak in two to four reeds at a time.  Most reed guards have four slots.  Break in two reeds at a time to avoid all four reeds dying at the same time.\nStudents should soak reeds as described in #5 in the previous section.  Reeds should not be soaked for too long; otherwise, they will become waterlogged.\nStudents should play on each new reed for no longer than five minutes.  If the tip becomes transparent, then the student should switch reeds.  The reed should not become waterlogged, and it should not be used when playing in extreme registers.\nAfter following this procedure for three days, students can start playing on the reeds for a longer period of time.  As this takes place, students and teachers can start to judge the sound quality of the reed and make any necessary adjustments.\nTricks for Adjusting Poor Quality Reeds  **secrets that students need not know….with the exception being very advanced HS students\nEvery reed is different and will sound different.\nStudents should learn to be picky about the sound quality of reeds.\nWhen dealing with a reed that is too soft:\nMove the reed up on the mouthpiece slightly.  This is only a temporary “quick fix” if there are no other reeds available.  The ligature can also be raised slightly on the reed/mouthpiece.  Do not raise the ligature above the bark (polished bottom part) of the reed.\nClip the reed using a reed clipper.  This cuts off part of the tip of the reed.  Only an experienced lesson teacher or a very knowledgeable band director should be clipping reeds.\nSet the reed aside and let it sit/age.  Time and weather will change the quality of a reed.\nColder climates make certain reeds sound thinner.  Students may need to wait for warmer weather before coming back to that particular reed.\nWhen dealing with a reed that is too hard:\nFor mildly hard reeds, “polish” the reed on a sheet of paper. Place the flat part of a reed (not the side with bark) on the paper and press/rub in circles with 2 or 3 fingers. This must be done on a flat surface.\nFor mildly hard reeds, the reed can be lowered slightly on the mouthpiece so that the thinner part of the reed is being played. Be aware, however, that this is only a quick fix. The ligature can also be moved slightly lower on the reed/mouthpiece, if necessary.\nFor slightly harder reeds, sand down the flat part of the reed with 600 grit sand paper (or finer). The reed must then be polished.\nFor very hard reeds:\nDetermine which side of the reed is harder.\nPlay on the left and right side to see which side is more difficult to produce a sound on.\nUse a reed knife and scrape off wood from both sides surrounding the heart. Do not scrape off the tip or the heart of the reed. Remove more cane from the thicker side.  Be very careful not to scrape off too much.\nAgain, only an experienced lesson teacher or a very knowledgeable band director should be scraping reeds.\nTry pushing on the tip of the reed with the thumb while it is on the mouthpiece. Close the tip opening and then press a little more 2-3 times. Check to see if the reed is softer.\nAsk an older/more experienced private lesson teachers for even more tricks that may be out there!\nSometimes a student is simply dealing with a bad reed………and throwing it away is easier than the frustration caused by the many attempts to fix/adjust the reed."

thus the reed is thicker)\n•  The harder the reed, the higher you play\n•  Firmer  embouchure  is  needed;  basically  feels  like  one  is  “biting  down”  on  the\ninstrument\n•  Costs about $6000-$9000 MSRP, $4000-$5000 with the discount through the\nschool\n•  Never to be used in middle school\n•  The high register tends to be flat on this instrument\n•  Avoid placing students on this instrument that have large hands/fingers\n•  Used in: Symphonie Fantastique by Berlioz\n•  Typical instrument used in middle school and high school\n•  Only clarinet that is student-owned as opposed to school-owned in most normal\ncircumstances\n•  Concert F is a written G (2nd line in treble clef)\n•  A school-owned instrument\n•  Slightly longer than Bb Clarinet (very subtle difference)\n•  Sounds a half step lower than a Bb Clarinet\n•  Concert F is a written G# (2nd line in treble clef)\n•  Keys and holes are more spread out\n•  Darker sound than a Bb Clarinet\n•  Low register has a richer sound\n•  Notes above the break are more resistant/challenging\n•  Since the A clarinet is a bigger instrument, it requires more air and embouchure\n•  Should not be used in middle school\n•  Used primarily in orchestral literature, band transcriptions, or if a student\nauditions for All-Region/All-State Orchestra\n•  Sometimes used in Solo and Ensemble literature at the high school level\n•  Used in: Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 4 by Tchaikovsky and Roman Carnival by\nBerlioz\n•  Sounds 2 octaves below Eb Clarinet\n•  Concert F is a written D (below staff)\n•  Most easily rewritten to Bass Clarinet\n•  Played with a neck strap\n•  Used primarily in a high school chamber choir, or if a student auditions for All-\nRegion/All-State Band\n•  Reads treble clef\n•  Used in: Lincolnshire Posy by Grainger\n•  Recommended to switch over Bb Clarinet players who have big sounds but\nmaybe at the bottom of their sections consistently\n•  Sounds an octave lower than written\n•  Sounds an octave lower than the Bb Clarinet\n•  Standard instrument for middle school and high school students\no  Demonstrate the Bass Clarinet in your recruiting concert(s) to develop\ninterest in your 5th graders\no  If there are students interested and you have the instruments available,\nstart them on the Bass Clarinet!!\n•  Lowest note is E below middle C (for older, one piece instruments)\n•  Older instruments are usually in once piece, newer instruments are often in two\nparts and can go to Eb below middle C (around $10K)\no  Even more advanced clarinets have enough keys to go down to low C,\nincluding an alternate low G# key\no  Bass clarinets that go down to a low C are slightly longer than a standard\nBass Clarinet\no  You will have less repair issues with two-piece instruments\nEb Contra-alto Clarinet (aka Eb Contra-bass Clarinet)\n•  Sounds two octaves lower than written\n•  Uses same transposition as the baritone saxophone\n•  Can be used in a middle school first band or a second band with eligibility issues\nin the tuba section\n•  Can be used in a high school band\n•  Can be used to enhance or replace a baritone saxophone or tuba\no Student can be given a baritone saxophone part since most literature will\nnot have a part for Eb Contra-alto Clarinet\n•  Have student sit on a double-stacked chair, or put electrical tape around a large\nphone book\n•  Sounds two octaves below the Bb clarinet\n•  Concert F is a written G (below staff)\n•  Should not used in middle school or high school unless a specific piece calls for it\n•  Students playing this instrument must sit on a stool\n•  Students playing this instrument must have a taller stature\n•  Maintenance issues typical with this instrument\n*The larger the instrument, the more susceptible they are to bent keys,\nbent rods and leaks.\nMiddle School Inventory\n•  Bass Clarinet\n•  Eb Contra-alto Clarinet (possibly)\nHigh School Inventory\n•    Bass Clarinet\n•   Eb Contra-alto Clarinet\n•   A Clarinet\n•   Eb Clarinet\n•  Eb Alto Clarinet (possibly for students auditioning for All-State\nor students performing in a clarinet choir for Ensemble Contest)\nCLARINET PEG STANDS\nHerb Blayman—Woodstock, Georgia\n•  A thick, metal plate of steel (or hard rubber) which is purchased separately from the pegs\n•  Heavy-duty with rubber pegs\n•  Stand is $74 for a double peg stand or $85 for a triple peg stand\n•  Bb and A clarinet peg: $56\n•  Eb clarinet peg: $60 (more expensive because the peg is more raised)\n•  You have to order each peg\n•  The triple peg stand can hold an Eb and 2 Bb pegs, but it is difficult to fit all three; the Bb\npegs can hold either a Bb or an A clarinet\n•  The Eb peg is raised so you can reach down more easily\n•  To take it apart, you have to unscrew the pegs and carry the base separately\n•  Screws do not tend to strip because they go far into the base\nHercules\n•  Yellow with black legs which fold out\n•  $27 for a stand with one peg\n•  $41 with 3 pegs; two pegs can hold either a Bb or an A clarinet; other peg is for E-flat\nclarinet\n•  Pegs do not have to be purchased separately\n•  Pegs are thinner than Blayman\n•  Can easily be collapsed, transported and stored\nCHARACTERISTICS WHEN RECRUITING AND\nSELECTING CLARINET PLAYERS\nPhysical Characteristics/Factors\n•  Fingers must be long and big enough to cover the holes.\n•  Avoid placing very small students with short arms on clarinet, because they will have a hard\ntime reaching the bottom joint.\n•  A full bottom lip is an attribute for success when possibly switching a student to bass\nclarinet.\n•  Students that are taller in stature and have longer arms could also be great candidates for bass\n•  Students playing clarinet must have a jaw that is flexible that can move forward and\nbackward.\n•  Unlike playing the flute and high brass instruments, having braces does not hinder students\nplaying clarinet.\n•  Avoid recruiting students on clarinet who are double-jointed.\n•  There are fewer physical characteristic factors when considering clarinet than most other\nwoodwind instruments.\nBEGINNING CLARINET CLASSROOM AND\nENSEMBLE SET-UP\nBeginning Classroom Set-Up\n•  Your beginning clarinet class should be taught in the band hall.\n•  Configure your classroom based on how many students you have in the class.  Unless you\nhave an unusually small class—in which case it can be taught in an ensemble room.\n•  Start off the semester by putting students in alphabetical order so you can learn their\nnames faster.  Once music stands and mirrors are utilized in class, hanging name tags can\ncontinue to help you learn student names quicker. These can and should also be used on\nany days you have clinicians/consultants visit.\nTypes of Classroom Set-Ups\n1.  Arched set-up\n(cid:1)\nIf using your “ensemble set-up” for your class, have students sit in a “box,” so all\nstudents receive the same amount of attention/eye contact from you.\n(cid:1)  Have students sit in every other chair (if all chairs have to remain in your set-up\nthroughout the day).\n(cid:1)  The aisles between your rows must be large enough so that you will have quick and\neasy access to any student--both from the front and the back.\nIf you end up needing to use risers, make sure the backings are on them for safety\nreasons. If the risers do not come with backings, you can enlist the help of either a\nband dad or your woodshop teacher to install backings.\n(cid:1)  As much as possible, have students in “windows.”\n(cid:1)  You must be able to see each student from the front and the back.  With that said, you\nare not always able to correct student’s posture, hand position, etc. from the front of\nthe room; thus, you need to be walking around the room instead of “parking” on a\nstool!\n(cid:1)  Once you start determining playing ability levels of your students, place weaker\nplayers in the front of the classroom and stronger players in the back. Less attention is\ntypically given to players who are further back in the set-up.\n2.  Horseshoe set-up\n(cid:1)  This set-up is not recommended--why? Because you have a limited range of vision.\nIf you decide to use this set-up, you will need to pull the stand/podium far enough\nback in order to have clear vision of every student.\n3.  Arched with aisle\n(cid:1)  This is a very acceptable set-up, even with full ensembles.\n4.  Straight line set-up\n(cid:1)  These should only be used with bigger facilities.\nIn order for you to have visual contact with all of the students, the students on the\nends of the rows will have to adjust their chairs/bodies towards you or you need to\nhave them sitting in a “box” (see arched set-up).\n5.  Straight line set-up with aisle\n6.  Circular set up\n(cid:1)  One teacher teaches from the inside and one from the periphery. Students face in\ntowards middle.\nIf you are teaching alone, it will be too hard to maneuver when teaching outside of\nthe circle.\n(cid:1)  This set-up is typical in elementary school cafeterias or small stage “cafetoriums”.\n7.  Have beginners only sit on right side of your band set-up.\n(cid:1)  This would assume that your flute and French horn players sit on the left side of your\nset-up.\nFull Ensemble Set-Up\n•  Again, clarinet players need to be on the opposite side of the ensemble as the flute and\nFrench horn players.\n•  First chairs need to sit together so they can more easily balance and match in terms of\nbalance, pitch, etc.\n•\nIt is recommended to have no more than three clarinet players on first part; furthermore,\nhigh school literature may only need two clarinet players on first part.\nLow Cl. (Option 1)\nLow Cl. (Option 2)\n•  Bass clarinet players should never be placed with the low brass in the back of the\nensemble…regardless of whether or not risers are utilized.\nTrombone\nTuba\nBass Cl (cid:2)\nRECOMMENDED B-FLAT CLARINET BRANDS/MODELS\nBeginner B-Flat Clarinet\nBuffet\nB10\nB12\nE11\nYamaha\nYCL-255\nYCL-450\nPlastic body; nickel-plated keys; MSRP $876.00 @ wwbw.com\nABS resin (wood finish); nickel-plated body keywork not fancy;\nMSRP $656.00 @ wwbw.com\nAfrican Blackwood; undercut tone holes; copper/silver plated\nkeywork; MSRP $2108.00 @ wwbw.com; (Recommended)\nMatte ABS Resin; nickel-silver keywork w/ nickel-plated finish;\ntapered undercut tone holes; MSRP $950.00 @ wwbw.com\nGrenadilla wood; nickel-silver keywork w/ silver plated finish;\ninserted, tapered undercut tone holes; MSRP $1,236.99 - $1,471.99\n@ wwbw.com; (Recommended)\nYCL-450N\nGrenadilla wood; nickel-silver keywork w/ nickel plated finish;\ninserted, tapered undercut tone holes set in plastic; MSRP\n$1675.00 @ wwbw.com; (Recommended)\nLeBlanc – Normandy\nModel 4\nGrenadilla wood; nickel-silver keywork; MSRP $6000.00  @\nwwbw.com\nProfessional B-Flat Clarinets\nR13\nUnstained Grenadilla wood; keywork pre-plated in copper and\nfinished in silver or nickel plate; double fish skin pads; MSRP\nNickel Silver Keys, $4841.00 @ wwbw.com\nSilver Plated Keys MSRP $3203.00 @ wwbw.com;\n(Recommended)\nR13 – Prestige\nfinished in silver plate; undercut tone holes; stainless steel rods and\npivot screws; Gore-Tex pads; MSRP $5803.00 @ wwbw.com;\nRC\nRC – Prestige\nStained choice Grenadilla wood; Eb lever option; stainless steel\nrods and pivot screws; double fish skin pads; MSRP $8943.00 @\npivot screws; Gore-Tex pads; smaller bore; available with full\nBoehm system - 20 keys / 7 rings articulated G#, F# / G# trill, low\nEb; available as a special model - 18 keys/ t rings with articulated\nG#; MSRP $5916.00 @ wwbw.com\nB-Flat Clarinet Brands to Avoid (only in my opinion ☺☺☺☺)\nJupiter\nSelmer\nSimba (Sam’s Club)\nBory (Sam’s Club)\nFirst Act (Wal-Mart)\nHarmony (JC Penney)\nArtley\nBuffet - Festival\nNot made of grenadilla wood; scale not as even as the R13/R13\nPrestige; expensive price not worth the extra equipment\nBundy\nBuscher\nLeblanc\nKing\nBoosey & Hawkes\nS Series\nReynolds\nYork\nBlessing\nPearl\nVito\nRECOMMENDED B-FLAT CLARINET\nMOUTHPIECES AND LIGATURES\nMouthpieces\nVandoren\n5RV – Lyre\n5RV\nB45\nM30\nMore open than 5RV and a slightly longer facing; MSRP $94.99-\n$99.99 (Recommended) @ wwbw.com\nStandard mouthpiece for beginners through college; MSRP $94.99\n@ wwbw.com\nStandard mouthpiece, a little more open than a 5RV or 5RV Lyre;\ncomes in three styles; (standard; B45 – Dot; B45 – Lyre); MSRP\n$94.99 @ wwbw.com\nLonger facing and more open than the 5RV or 5RV Lyre; MSRP\nwww.vandoren.fr/en/clarinetbb.html - Use this link to access a mouthpiece chart to\nsee the differences between the mouthpieces listed above.\nGigliotti – P34\nClose tip; short curve; MSRP $108.99 @ mouthpieceexpress.com\n(Recommended for MS/JH 1st Band and above)\nAdvanced Mouthpieces\nGregory Smith\nhttp://www.gregory-smith.com, around $300.00\nRichard Hawkins\nhttp://www.richardhawkinsmouthpiece.com around $250.00\nNote: Just visit these clarinet mouthpiece maker’s websites for details on their\nmouthpieces.

Most cases have the handles placed on the bottom section\nof each case. Check to make sure.\n•  Place all clarinet cases on the floor in front of the student.\n•  Be sure the student understands where each part of the instrument belongs in\nthe case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make\nsure the student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure\nthe parts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse order they\nwere removed.\n•  All instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure\nexplicitly every time.\n•  Never leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up,\nbut this is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.\nCheck each opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to\nyour students.\n•  Cases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom\n“set-up” for each student’s case.  If using an ensemble room for the class, the\ncases may be opened in the hall.  The empty case will remain closed and\nlatched in the hall during class.\n•  When instruments are in their cases, do not allow students to sit on their cases\nAT ANY TIME because the keys will get bent.\nIdentifying Parts of the Clarinet and Removing It Safely From Its Case\n•  Once the case information is understood, place the case on the floor.  Never let\nthe student place the case in his lap.\n•  Open the case from its correct position.  Remember, most latches will lift up.\nIdentify the lower joint:  this joint has a thumb rest on the bottom side and three\nsilver rings on the upper. When replaced correctly in the case, the thumb rest\nshould never be seen.\nIdentify the upper joint:  the register key is on the bottom, but call it the “long,\nskinny” key or the “exclamation point” key. Students will remember this\ndescription more easily in the beginning.  It also has only two silver rings on\nthe top.\n•  When new instruments are delivered during the summer, be sure to remove the\nparts carefully from the plastic wrapping, and remove the corks (which are used\nto help pads keep their shape during shipping) between the rods.\n•  Corks on a new beginner instrument are usually really fat mainly due to heat\nexposure during the delivery process.  The parts will not easily fit together.\nOnly someone with experience should carefully sand the corks to the proper\nsize.  Using very fine sand paper (400), take off a very small amount and wrap\nit around and turn from side to side, being careful not to scrape too much as it\ncould damage the wood or mouthpiece. After this process, test it many times\nuntil you have the correct fit that can easily be controlled by a small child.\n•  For both new and used beginner instruments, it may be necessary to apply cork\ngrease lightly to the corks after instruments are delivered during the summer.\nMaking a ring with your thumb and forefinger, work the cork grease into each\ncork to create enough friction to properly lubricate the corks. Students will\neventually need to be taught to apply cork grease as well. Even if the student\nunderstands how little is needed, you still must watch them apply the cork\ngrease several times before you trust them to do the job alone.  Never let the\nstudent have his own tube of cork grease in the beginning of the learning\nprocess.  After he has proven his competence, he may have the tube.  If any\ngiven cork looks dull, and the tenon is difficult to fit with the receiver, a small\namount of cork grease may be needed. Teach him to ask you first before\napplying. Once you know he has made the correct analysis, the student may\nmake his own decisions. Cork grease tubes or liquid grease can explode or melt\ninside the case if the respective lids are not completely closed. It is possible that\ndamage to the key mechanism will result if cork grease comes in contact with\nthe wood, metal or even other maintenance kit items.\n•  The barrel of the clarinet will look like a barrel, and will have a large end and a\nsmall end. The large end is placed on the upper joint, and the mouthpiece (to be\nidentified later) is placed into the small end.\n•  The bell looks like a bell and is placed on the lower joint.\n•  The mouthpiece has a thin end and a fat end.  The top is curved, and the bottom\n(table) is flat.  The importance of these features will be explained later.\n•  The ligature is usually metal for the beginning instrument, having both a large\nend and a small end. The screws for the ligature will always appear on the right\nside of the mouthpiece as the student looks at the mouthpiece from the flat side.\nScrews for ligatures will never appear on the left side of the mouthpiece.\n•  The reed is basically the same shape as the mouthpiece.  It has a thin end and a\nfat end…..a flat side and a curved side.\n•  The reed/mouthpiece cap (protector) should be made of plastic (and sometimes\nmetal with attic horns) for the beginning instrument.  If metal protectors are\nused, be aware that they will most likely scratch the mouthpiece and perhaps\ndamage the tip of the reed.  Using a plastic protector will result in fewer broken\nreeds.  Students should always keep their mouthpiece in a mouthpiece cap\nwhen the instrument is not being played (including moving from a warm-up\nroom to a concert stage). A single chip in a mouthpiece can render it useless,\ncausing students to have to purchase a new one.\n•  The table (flat part) of the mouthpiece may not necessarily be exactly flat;\nsometimes they warp over time and with usage.  To fix this, use the finest\nsandpaper (400).  Place the sandpaper on a piece of glass.  Rub the table of the\nmouthpiece on the combined surface of sandpaper and glass.  Check often to\nsee if the mouthpiece does not “rock” when placed against the plate glass.  The\ntip of the mouthpiece can also be carefully rubbed on the combined surface of\nsandpaper and glass.\n•  Periodically have mouthpiece checks.  Check for chips on rails and on the tip.\nAlso check for chips on the inside of the tip.  Give written work to your\nstudents while you check each mouthpiece carefully.  A chipped mouthpiece\ncan be devastating to a beginning clarinet student’s embouchure development.\n•  No music, folders, flipfolders, rolled up music or unnecessary objects may be\nplaced in the case on top of the instrument at any time…..unless they can fit\ninside the nook meant for these items.\n•  Students should not be allowed to keep anything in the bell (i.e. reeds,\nmouthpieces, cork grease, etc.).  Pertaining specifically to bass clarinet, some\nof these items could actually get stuck in the bell/instrument.\n•  Look at the case in relation to the parts of the clarinet. Most cases are molded\nto the shape of the particular parts.  Be specific when making this point to your\nstudents.  Take your time, and repeat the information many times. When parts\nare placed correctly in the case, all silver rings are pointing toward the ceiling.\nDamage will occur if the parts are placed incorrectly in the case.\nStorage of Mouthpiece and Barrel (when allowed to be taken home by the students\nbut not in the actual clarinet case)\n•  Provide students a Ziploc bag…..or have students bring a sock or padded bag\nwith some sort of identifying feature\n•  Ziploc bags/socks should be kept in a box in the front of the classroom, or\nstored safely in an office or filing cabinet.\n•  Bags/socks should only be taken out of the classroom by students after school.\n•  Bags/socks should only be brought into the classroom prior to the start of\nschool.\n•  Contents of bags/socks should never be kept in backpacks, bookbags, pencil\npouches, etc.\n•  Have some sort of accountability system in place when students leave their\nbags/socks overnight.  (cid:1)\n•  Be on the lookout for students coming into your classroom with bags/socks\n(and later clarinet cases) which were kept in their lockers or gym lockers.

The other parts (upper joint, lower joint, and bell) will remain in the case until\nfurther instruction is given.\n•  Students should be told that after sound production has been taught on the “set-up,”\nthey will be allowed to take home the body of the clarinet as well. To sell this concept\nto the parents, explain the money factor.  It is almost as expensive to replace one\nbroken item as it is to buy an entire instrument.\nAssembly of the mouthpiece and barrel “set-up”\n1.  Open the case, which should be on the floor in front of the student.\n2.  Put the reed in the mouth to moisten and smooth the top and bottom of it.\nMoistening the bottom of a reed helps create a seal, which will result in\nbetter response.\n3.  Pick up the barrel with the right hand, and the mouthpiece (without the\nligature) with the left hand. Never grab the tip of the mouthpiece; always\ngrasp around the middle.\n4.  When assembling the mouthpiece and barrel, students should use slight\ntwisting motions. No cork should be showing.\n5.  Place the large end of the ligature over the mouthpiece carefully.  Make\nsure the screws are on the right (some “stock” ligatures have screws on the\nfront of the mouthpiece) as you look at them from the table of the\nmouthpiece.  Bonade ligatures have two screws……BG ligatures have one\nscrew.  If using Rovner ligatures, the leather is in the front and there is one\nscrew in the back.\n6.  Lift the ligature slightly with the thumb and forefinger of a chosen hand,\nand carefully slide the reed onto the table of the mouthpiece.  The reed is\nplaced fat to fat, flat to flat and thin to thin.\n7.  The edges of the reed should be aligned along the rails/sides of the table of\nthe mouthpiece.\n8.  Look for a thin black line/sliver at the tip of the mouthpiece.\n9.  The ligature should cover at least one of the two lower lines that appear on\nmost quality mouthpieces, and definitely below the upper line on most\nquality mouthpieces.\n10. For ligatures with two screws:  tighten the lower screw snuggly, and the\ntop screw to its first point of resistance.  For ligatures with one screw:\ntighten the screw to its first point of resistance.  Generally speaking,\nligatures that are placed too low result in control issues; ligatures that are\nplaced too high prohibit reed vibration.\n11. Put the mouthpiece cap on the mouthpiece and barrel set-up.\n12. Lay down the set-up gently in the case.\nAssembly of the body of the clarinet (assuming that the assembly of the mouthpiece\nand barrel set-up is already completed and is kept in a safe place)\n1.  Pick up the upper joint.  Use the right hand, and lay it in your left hand.\nThe palm of the left hand is toward the ceiling.  The long skinny key goes\naway from the body and toward the floor.\n2.  Pick up the lower joint with the right hand between the pancake keys.  The\npalm of the right hand should be toward the floor and the thumb rest\nshould also point to the floor.  Lock the thumb and forefinger of the right\nhand around the joint.\n3.  Place the middle finger of the left hand over the covered key between the\nsilver rings and press down.  This will lift the bridge key.\n4.  The student cannot place two tenons or two receivers together.  The tenon\non the bottom of the upper joint fits into the receiver of the lower joint.\nPlace the tenon into the receiver in a horizontal position.  Any angle could\nresult in damage to the tenon.  Twist and push in opposite directions. No\ncork should be showing. Assist students who are not strong enough to\naccomplish this task.\n5.  Check to see if the keys are in line and facing the student.  Run the index\nfinger of the left hand down the silver rings to make sure they line up.\n6.  Slide the left hand down between the pancake keys on the lower joint.\n7.  Holding the connected upper and lower joint with the left hand, pick up\nthe bell with the right hand.\n8.  Place the bell on the right knee.\n9.  Place the bell and lower joint together; twist and push. No cork should be\nshowing.\n10. Holding the assembled body of the clarinet with the left hand, slide the\nhand to the top of the upper joint.  Using the right hand, twist and push the\nassembled mouthpiece and barrel to the clarinet.  Make sure the table of\nthe mouthpiece is in line with the long skinny key.\nInstrument Disassembly and Swabbing\n1.  Holding the assembled body of the clarinet with the left hand, slide the\nhand to the top of the upper joint.  Using the right hand, twist and pull the\nassembled mouthpiece and barrel off of the clarinet.\n2.  Put the mouthpiece cap on the mouthpiece and barrel set-up.\n3.  Lay down the set-up gently in the case and grab the silk swab.\n4.  The clarinet must be held upside-down so the swab can be dropped\nthrough the bell and through the bottom of the upper joint with slight tugs.\nWhen holding the clarinet, one hand must be at the bottom of the upper\njoint. Do not yank or pull the swab from side-to-side, but rather up and\ndown. Pulling the swab too forcefully or quickly may result in the swab\ngetting stuck or torn by the register flu inside the upper joint of the\n5.  After swabbing the body, slide the left hand down to the pancake keys.\nWith the right hand, remove the bell with a twisting motion and place it in\nthe case correctly.\n6.   Slide the left hand to the top of the upper joint. Place the middle finger of\nthe left hand over the covered key between the silver rings and press\ndown. This will lift the bridge key.\n7.  Place the right hand over the pancake keys. Take apart the upper and\nlower joint horizontally with a twisting motion.\n8.  Place the lower joint back in the case. Make sure the thumb rest is down\nso that it cannot be seen. The silver rings should be pointing straight up.\n9.  Place the upper joint in the case to that the rings are facing up and the\nregister key (exclamation mark key) is facing down. Be careful not to\nbend the side/trill keys when putting the upper joint back in the case.\n10. Pick up the set-up with the left hand and take off the mouthpiece cap.\n11. Loosen the ligature screw(s). Do not let the students loosen the screw(s) so\nmuch that the screws fall out!\n12. Remove the reed by lifting the ligature with the thumb and forefinger,\nbeing careful not to have any contact with the tip of the reed.  “Vacuum”\nthe reed through the lips……blot the reed on the pants/shorts if\nnecessary……and put in the reed guard.\n13. Remove the ligature from the mouthpiece and place it on the stand. Take\napart the mouthpiece and barrel with a twisting motion. Make sure\nstudents do not grab the tip of the mouthpiece!!!\n14. Pick up the swab and wrap the swab around an index finger to clean the\nreceivers of the barrel and mouthpiece, as well as the tip of the\nmouthpiece. Now the barrel can be placed in the case.\n15. Place a dry or broken reed back on the mouthpiece without tightening the\nscrews. The ligature must be put on so that the screws are facing the same\ndirection when put on earlier. Consider using an old or unused DRY reed\nto be placed on the mouthpiece at the end of each playing session, whether\nit is at school or at home.  Always leave the ligature on the mouthpiece\nwith this “dry reed,” which is replacing the “class reed.”  This will prevent\ndamage and allow the ligature to form and bond more correctly with the\nmouthpiece.  A “USED/WET” REED WILL RESULT IN MOLD OR\nMILDEW FORMING ON THE REED, IN THE MOUTHPIECE\nAND THE CASE.\n16. Put the mouthpiece cap on the mouthpiece after the reed and ligature are\nsecured. Place the mouthpiece in the case with the screws of the ligature\nfacing upwards.\n•  Students should be given CLASS TIME to clean out their instrument, and store their\nreed and instrument properly in the case.\n•  When the clarinets have to be set down on the chair or floor for any reason (leaving\nclass, breathing exercises where students are standing, etc.), it is important that the\nthumb rest is facing down.  This is to prevent the keys from being damaged.\n•  When students must set down their instrument during a class, the mouthpiece (or\nmouthpiece and barrel) needs to be removed and placed on the chair (mouthpiece cap\nshould be placed on the mouthpiece); the body of the instrument can then be placed\nunderneath the chair in the above-stated manner.\n•  SEND SEGMENTS OF THIS INFORMATION HOME TO PARENTS.\nCHOOSE THE INFORMATION YOU THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR\nHOME PRACTICE AND INSTRUMENT CARE.\nInstrument/Body Ratio\n•  Familiarize the student with the instrument/body ratio by using only the upper and\nlower joints.\n•  The left hand should gently hold the upper joint in the same manner used to assemble\nthe instrument--without putting pressure on the long keys.\n•  The right hand should hold the lower joint in the same manner used to assemble the\ninstrument--without putting pressure on the long keys.\n•  Move the instrument up and down, side to side by using the elbows.  All aspects of\nthe brass instrument information hold true here.  The body playing position also holds\ntrue from previous information.  We are merely getting used to the weight of the\ninstrument; the position of the instrument; and the angle of the instrument without\nusing correct hand position.  The student should not squeeze the instrument as these\nexercises are practiced.  Keep the palms of the hands soft.\n•  Familiarize the student in this manner for a few days before placing the fingers in\ntheir correct position.\nBASS CLARINET NECKS AND\nEFFECTS ON POSTURE\nNecks\n•  There are two basic types of bass clarinet necks-- “Bay” necks and “Goose” necks.\n“Bay” refers to Charles Bay, who owns a company that produces various clarinet and\nsaxophone accessories.\n•  Bay necks are generally found on Buffet Prestige bass clarinets.\n•  Goose necks are generally found on Selmer bass clarinets, as well as most other\nbrands that are manufactured.\n“Bay” style neck\n“Goose” style neck\n•  Notice the difference in the curvature on the bottom left side of the neck. The Bay\nstyle neck is curved up considerably more; this angles the mouthpiece higher as well.\n•  When setting the instrument with the student, the Bay style neck makes it much easier\nfor the student to achieve the mouthpiece angle, which should be very similar to a B-\nflat soprano clarinet.\nInstrument angle and posture\n•  The instrument angle for students using a Bay style neck is different from that of a\ngoose neck.\nInstrument angle with Bay style neck\nInstrument angle with goose neck\nMouthpiece angle with Bay style neck\nMouthpiece angle with goose neck\n•  The student should sit on the edge of their chair with their feet firmly planted on the\nground shoulder width apart.  As with the teaching of all wind instruments, the\nstudent’s feet should be under their knees.\n•  The bass clarinet should be between their legs. Do not let students play the bass\nclarinet on either side of their legs. This will cause severe hand position\nproblems. Female students might be discouraged from wearing skirts if it is a\nhindrance.\nInstrument angle with a Bay style neck\n•  The student should keep the instrument close to vertical. The instrument can be tilted\nin toward the body for hand position purposes, if necessary.\n•  The student should have the peg or bell sit between their heels or slightly behind the\nheels.\nInstrument angle with a goose neck\n•  The student should tilt the bass clarinet toward their body so that the peg or bell sits\nunder the front chair legs.\n•  Keep an eye on the student’s mouthpiece. It should have an upward angle of\napproximately 20 to 30 degrees.\nIt is okay for the student to learn forward with their whole upper body bent at the\nhips. Do not let the student bend the upper part of their back in a slouched position to\nreach the mouthpiece.\n•  To prevent incorrect right hand position, a neck strap is sometimes recommended.\nWithout a neck strap, the student will tend to rest the crook of their right hand\nunderneath the two bottom side keys or on the rods to hold up the instrument; this is\nincorrect.\nCLARINET HAND POSITION\nRIGHT HAND POSITION\n1.  Place the right hand first, with the lower joint supported by the leg.  The right\nhand lifts the instrument, and the placement is less difficult or complicated.\nThe upper joint can be gently held by the left hand as you begin the awkward\nprocess of finding the correct place for every finger.\n2.  Place the fleshy finger pads over the silver rings first.  Without putting\npressure on the finger tips, feel the pads fall into the holes.\n3.  The hand will begin in a straight across angle, and will be in the “flat-C”\nposition…not too curved and not too straight.\n4.  Place the thumb on the thumb rest between the rest and the leg.  The thumb\nnail touches the rest. Very little (preferably, no) flesh will touch the thumb\nrest. The thumb joint must always be to the right of the thumb rest, never\nbehind it.\n5.  Turn the clarinet out in front of the student like a spyglass and make sure there\nis open space between the body of the clarinet and the hand.\n6.  The pinky rests on the most comfortable of the four keys it will use later in\nthis process (either key #1, which is the low F key—or key #2, which is the\nlow G#/Ab key). The pinky should not be straight; it needs to be curved.\nWatch for pinkies that disappear either under the clarinet or under the pinky\nkeys.\n7.  The middle finger will appear higher because it is longer than the other\nfingers.\n8.  No part of any finger should touch any rod.\n9.  Practice moving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.  Do not let\nthe other two knuckles move.  The finger pads should fall directly into the\nholes.  In the beginning the pinky can move up and down also.\n10. Lean the clarinet back on the left shoulder and look at the right hand fingers as\nyou do this. While doing this, the left hand must remain in its proper “baby\nposition” holding the upper joint.\n11. Make sure to feel all parts of the ring with the finger pads.\n12. Keep the right hand straight across the body of the clarinet for at least 6 to 8\nweeks before moving into the more correct angled position. This makes it\neasier for the ring finger and pinky to function more comfortably.\n13. Do not include side keys in the initial hand position information.  If asked, tell\nthem once the hands can move correctly using the rings and tone holes, they\nwill be allowed to learn to use the keys on the side.\nLEFT HAND POSITION  *critical and paramount to the success of playing\nthe clarinet\n1.  While holding the lower joint gently (not using correct hand position but the\nproper “baby” position) with the right hand as it rests on the leg, place the\nmiddle knuckle of the index finger on the G# key at the top of the upper joint.\nPlace the first knuckle on the A key with the fleshy part of the tip angled\ndown toward the first silver ring.  The teacher will have to identify these\n“named keys” for the student.\n2.  Place the middle finger over the second silver ring.\n3.  Place the ring finger over the third hole with no silver ring.\n4.  Place the thumb over the ring on the back of the upper joint with the fleshy\npart of the end being aware of the long, skinny key (register key).  The angle\nof the thumb should be at “1:00/2:00.”\n5.  The pinky will rest on the most comfortable of the four keys it will use later in\nthis process (either key #1, which is the low E key—or key #4, which is the\nlow C# key). The pinky should not be straight; it needs to be curved. Watch\nfor pinkies that disappear either under the clarinet or under the pinky keys.\n6.  Keep the hand in an adjusted “Flat-C” position and the wrist slightly up.  The\nwrist must stay in line with the rest of the forearm.\n7.  Continue to rest the clarinet on the leg and watch to see if the left hand\nfollows the line of the upper joint to form the angle of a “V” with the upper\njoint.\n8.  Do not allow the knuckles of the index finger to lose contact with the G# and\nA keys. For example, A should not be played without the index finger also\ntouching (not pressing) the G#/Ab key.\n9.  If the thumb is not being used to play specific sounds on the instrument it\nMUST NOT touch the body (wood) of the instrument.\n10. ALWAYS KEEP ONE HAND ON THE CLARINET AT ALL TIMES.\nNEVER SIMPLY LAY IT IN THE LAP.\n11. Beginners can have “fly-away” fingers in the beginning as long as they fall\nback down to the correct rings.  The exception is the left index finger.  If we\ntry to get them to keep their fingers in the “finished” position too soon, the\nhands can become too tense.  Always feel the palm of the hands to check for\nthe softness of the fingers.  There are more bones in this area of the hand than\nany other part of the body.  If the palm is soft, all other parts of the hand will\nbe as naturally soft as is possible.  The pinkies should have comfortable\n“home keys” they touch all of the time in the beginning stages.\n12.  Beginning clarinet hand position is very awkward, thus taking longer to\nachieve and more patience from the teacher and student is required.  Do not\nget in a hurry.\nFINGER EXERCISES\n1.  All fingers in each hand move together.  Call out the hand you wish to move.\nThe students move all of the fingers in that hand down to seat into the rings\nand tone holes.  The right hand thumb obviously does not ever move when the\nteacher asks for “RIGHT”, but the left hand thumb will move to its ring with\nthe fingers of the left hand when the teacher asks for “LEFT”.\n2.  Next, we move the fingers one at a time beginning with the left hand.  The\nthumb and first finger are already down in this exercise, and each additional\nfinger in both hands will be numbered two through six from top of the upper\njoint to the bottom of the lower joint. The fingers will move down or up\ndepending on their starting position, as the number is called by the teacher.\nWe do not use the pinkies when we first begin this exercise.  Later, they will\nbe numbered seven and eight.\n3.  Watch the fingers to see that they move smoothly, cover the holes, stay in\nnatural position and move up and down from the big knuckle only.  The\nstudent should understand that the movement is aided by the soft tissue of the\npalm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand.\n4.  Next, we move the fingers in combinations: one, two….one, two\nthree…….one, two, three, four……one, two, three, four, five…..one, two,\nthree, four, five, six………six, five, four, three, two, one……five, four, three,\ntwo, one…….four, three, two, one……three, two, one………two, one……\nLater in the development the thumb movement is added.\n5.  Using these exercises, the fingers move in all of the ways they move to play\nthe clarinet: all together, one at a time, and in combinations.\n6.  When learning to use the pinkies, we number the keys one through four.  The\nteacher calls out the number, and the student moves the pinky in either hand in\na circular motion to the numbered key.  Call the numbers in order: call the\nnumbers backward: call the numbers diagonally: call the numbers in any order\nyou wish.  Begin using the pinkies separately, and then show the students the\ncorrelation of the keys on the left and right side of the clarinet.\nREED MANUFACTURERS AND REED STRENGTH\nReed Manufacturers:\nVandoren (blue box)\n•  Most widely used and recommended for any\nlevel of playing\n•  Available in strengths 1 through 5\n•  Clarinet – MSRP $41.99 @ wwbw.com\nAlto saxophone – MSRP $53.99\nVandoren V-12 (silver box)\n•  For more advanced players\n•  More consistent reed to reed, but do not last\nas long  as blue box reeds (has to do with\nhow they are cut)\n•  More expensive than blue box reeds\n•  Better “out of the box” than blue box reeds\n•  Slightly harder than blue box reeds\n•  Clarinet – MSRP $55.99 @ wwbw.com\nAlto saxophone – MSRP $61.99\nVandoren 56 (made for clarinet only)\n•  Cut from thicker cane\n•  MSRP $55.99 @ wwbw.com\nMitchell Lurie (made for clarinet only)\n•  For lower socio-economic areas, these reeds\nare an acceptable brand.\n•  A cheaper substitute for Vandoren blue box\nreeds\n•  MSRP $32.75 @ wwbw.com\nRico Reeds\n•  Less expensive, but not the best\nquality\n•  Acceptable for beginners in a\nlower socio-economic area, but not\nrecommended for long term use\n•  Clarinet – MSRP $29.50\nAlto saxophone –MSRP $42.00\nD’Addario Reserve\nClarinet Reserve – blue/white box\nClarinet Reserve Classic – purple/white\nbox\nAlto saxophone Reserve – green/white box\n•  Softer reeds which produce a stuffier\nsound\n•  Considered perfect “out of the box”,\nbut do not last a long time\n•  Clarinet – MSRP $58.75\nAlto saxophone – MSRP $54.75\nGonzalez (made for saxophone only)\n•  Cane comes from Argentina.\n•  More consistent than Vandoren\nreeds, but will not sound as good\n•  Available in ¼ strengths\nLa Voz (recommended for saxophone only)\n•  Acceptable for beginners in a lower socio-\neconomic area, but not  recommended for long\nterm use\n•  Less expensive option\n•  MSRP $45.25 @ wwbw.com\n•  Brands to avoid\no  Legere\no  Rico Royal\no  Riyin\no  Rigotti\no  Marca\no  La Voz – Acceptable for beginners in lower socio-economic areas\no  Alexander\no  any flavored reeds\no  any plastic reeds\n•  Specifically for saxophone, you are recommended to avoid:\no  Vandoren Java (green box) or Vandoren ZZ (black box), as these are file-\ncut Java reeds\no  Vandoren V16 (green box), which are reeds used for jazz playing\no  Vandoren “hand select” reeds (black box); these reeds are over $40 a box!\nIn handouts given out at the beginning of the year, inform parents about purchasing\nreeds.  Try to arrange it so students only buy reeds from the school.  Be sure the\nparents know that by purchasing the reeds from the school, they will receive a\n“___ percent” discount.  Make arrangements with your road man to facilitate this\nReed Strength\n•  Reeds generally come in half strength. Strengths that are offered vary by\nmanufacturer.\no  Strength is relative to the thickness of the reed. For example, a 2½ reed is\nthinner than a 3.\no  Larger strength reeds require more air; therefore, it is vital that beginners start\non a 2 or 2½, because they are still learning how to use their air properly. It is\nimportant to know that some reed manufacturers produce 1 and 1½ strength\nreeds!!!!! NOW….. considering the fact that professionals generally play\nbetween 3½ to 5 strength reeds, it would naturally make sense that MS/JH\nstudents not be playing on these stronger reeds!!!!!!!!\no  Reed strength is also dependent on the climate and player’s preference.\no  REFRAIN FROM PRESENTING THE “BADGE OF HONOR”\nPHILOSOPHY:\nFor example, if your students are playing on 2½ strength reeds in their\nbeginner class, they should not be told that they will advance to a 3 strength\nreed their second year…to a 3½ strength reed their third year…etc. You must\ncarefully base your decision to advance a student’s reed strength on the\nfollowing characteristics:\n1.  How students look—do their faces look natural when they are playing?\n2.  How students use their air—if they are not using air correctly, they will\nnot have success on any reed strength.\n3.  How students sound—is their sound stuffy?  Do you hear more air than\ntonal resonance in their sound?\nIf a clinician or mentor, after hearing your students, suggests a softer\nreed strength, students should be trained to accept this professional\nadvice. It is your job (as well as experienced private teachers if\napplicable) to closely monitor each individual student, as they will be\nplaying and developing at different levels. With that said, students\nshould move up a reed strength when the teachers feel it is time.\n•  It is perfectly acceptable for first/second year students to remain\non 2 or 2 ½ strength reeds for a long period of time. Second and\nthird year players may progress to 3 strength reeds as time goes by.\n•  Young band directors are encouraged to consult with an experienced\nprivate lesson teacher or band director/colleague when trying to make\ndecisions regarding appropriate times to advance reed strengths for\nstudents.\nReed Strengths Specifics Regarding Saxophone\n•  Most advanced alto saxophone players should remain on Vandoren 3s for classical\nsaxophone playing throughout the duration of their public school experience.\n•  MS/JH tenor and baritone saxophone players should begin on Vandoren 2 ½s.\n•  HS tenor saxophone players may progress to Vandoren 3s…maybe 3 ½s.\n•  HS baritone saxophone players may progress to Vandoren 3s.\nReed Qualities\n•  All reeds are hand-made. Every reed will sound different and will slightly vary in\nthickness as well as quality. The strength can be the same, but the individual cut will\nhave effects on the sound quality. Hard and soft does not refer to the actual reed\nstrength, but instead the individual cut of the reed. There are two distinct categories:\no  Hard\n(cid:1)  Thicker (more wood)\n(cid:1)  Requires more air\n(cid:1)  Requires a firmer embouchure\n(cid:1)  Can potentially allow students to bite more\n(cid:1)  Generally sounds airy/fuzzy, brittle, unclear, and is sharper in pitch\n(cid:1)  Playing with a hard reed can create tension in the face/embouchure, as\nwell as the jaw and neck.\no  Soft\n(cid:1)  Thinner (less wood)\n(cid:1)  The embouchure does not have to be as firm to produce a good sound.\n(cid:1)  Does not allow you to bite as much\n(cid:1)  The sound will be soft, honky, less resonant, unfocused, and\nsometimes spread.\n(cid:1)  Playing softly will be easier, but louder dynamics will have a bright\nsound. Louder dynamics will also be flat in pitch.\no  Try to find a medium “in between” reed that produces the best, desirable\nsound for each individual student.\nReed Life Cycle\n•  The cane is hand cut in the south of France in Var. Reeds are then individually\npackaged and shipped.\n•  Breaking in a reed (explained in Soaking, Breaking In and Adjusting Reeds\nhandout).\n•  Reeds that are rotated can last for 2-4 weeks depending on how much they are played\non.\no  The more a reed is played on, the softer it gets.\no  As reeds get older, they lose resonance.\no  If a reed is used too long in one sitting, the moisture that has been collecting\nin the pores of the reed will cause mold to build up.\n•  Reeds that are too thin and/or worn down from excessive use will become\nunacceptable in terms of quality and sound.\no  The response will be slow.\no  Vibrations will be slow.\no  The reed becomes thin and will produce an undesirable, spread sound.\no  Students will start to squeak on starts because the reed is harder to control.\no  MOLD will become visible.\no  These are all signs that a reed needs to be replaced.\nFinding a Good Reed\n•  Just because a reed is new, it does not mean that it will sound good.\n•  You can tell a good reed from a bad reed by sight.\no  Good reeds are yellow or crème colored on the heart.\no  Good reeds look “clean.”\no  Bad reeds have visible veins.\no  Bad reeds have a tip that is too transparent (this can be seen if a reed is held\nup to a light).\n•  You—as the teacher—reserve the right to tell a student that a reed can no longer be\nplayed.  Be professional and sensitive when telling a student a reed is bad and needs\nto be thrown away.  Parents should be made aware of this information before\ntheir child is officially recruited to play a single reed instrument.\n•  It is also important for parents to understand that as their child becomes more\nadvanced/experienced, their reeds can last longer…..AS LONG AS THE\nSTUDENTS ARE FOLLOWING ALL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN DURING\nCLASS!!  As this process evolves over time, reeds may not need to be purchased\nas often as they were when the students were first and second year players!\n•  You are encouraged to create a “Reed Graveyard” for students to deposit reeds that\nneed to be disposed of. This can be labeled and decorated as a motivating factor for\nstudents to want to deposit reeds… as opposed to leaving them on music stands, the\nfloor, or in their cases. (cid:2)\n•  To monitor quality of reeds, be sure to hear students play individually EVERY\nDAY…. regardless of their experience and/or playing ability.\nReed Guards and Reed Rotation\n•  Students must have reed guards with four completely broken in reeds.\n•  Students must be taught from the beginning to rotate each of their four reeds, which\nshould always be in their reed guard.\n•  Students should be trained to play on a DIFFERENT, BROKEN IN REED during\nevery class period/rehearsal or performance opportunity.  For example, a student\nshould not play on a reed more than one performance opportunity on any given day\n(exceptions—warm-ups and/or rehearsals prior to major individual or group\nauditions/performances).\n•  Reeds with chips, mold, etc., should never be played on—or even kept—in the reed\nguard. In addition, reeds that are too thin—or do not sound good for whatever\nreason—should never be kept in the reed guard.\n•  Reed guard checks should be daily in beginning classes at first. Daily grades should\nbe given when having a reed guard check. Each of the four reeds should be 25%.\n•  Reed guard checks can be periodic in MS/JH and HS ensembles as often as you feel\nnecessary.  Grades can be given as motivation.\n•  Reed guards should be accessible during daily rehearsals, as well as any off campus\nrehearsal, performance, contest, festival, etc. Reed guard accessibility pertains to\nthem being outside of their cases, not inside.\nSOAKING, BREAKING IN AND ADJUSTING REEDS\nSoaking Reeds\n•  Soak/break in the very first reed…. for several minutes…. together in class while\nthe teacher is closely monitoring the students.  Following this process, the teacher\nshould assign three additional reeds to be broken in for homework.  With that said,\nreed guards should be going home with students each and every day—whether or not\nthe entire instrument is going home.\n1.  Remove the reed from the plastic reed holder.  The left hand should hold the plastic\nreed holder, with the thumb on the reed guard logo.  The right hand thumb and index\nfinger should carefully slide the reed out of the plastic reed holder, with the tip\ncoming out first.\n2.  Hold the reed with the thumb on the words and the index finger on the back.\n3.  Lay the reed on the tongue.  Talk to students about the unusual taste of the reed, and\nassure them that with time, this process will become second nature.\n4.  Draw the tongue in.  The teeth should not have any contact with the reed.\n5.  Place the reed in the mouth to moisten and smooth the top and bottom of it.\nMoistening the bottom (butt) of the reed helps create a seal around the mouthpiece,\nwhich will result in better response.\n6.  Flatten the tip of the reed by putting the side with words on the table (flat part of the\nmouthpiece).  Place the thumb on the on the tip of the reed, (which is now on the\ntable) and wiggle the reed back and forth to get any warps out.  This helps with over-\nall reed vibration.\n7.  Vacuum reeds at the end of class (have students suck air through the mouthpiece to\neliminate water on the reed).\n8.  At the end of each class period/practice session, suck the air through the mouthpiece\nto eliminate water on the reed.  Reeds can now be “vacuumed” by carefully removing\nthe reed through the lips.  Reeds can furthermore be blotted on shorts/jeans/etc.  This\nwill eliminate excessive saliva to remain on the reed…which will eventually mold if\nnot vacuumed.  (cid:1)\n9.  With the plastic reed holder held in the same manner as discussed in #1, carefully\nslide the butt of the reed into the reed guard first, so that the tip is not destroyed.\nBreaking in Reeds\n•  There are two specific reasons why breaking in reeds is important:\n1.  so reeds last longer\n2.  so students will always have reeds on hand\n•  There is a process involved to properly and effectively break in a reed:\no  Break in two to four reeds at a time.  Most reed guards have four slots.  Break\nin two reeds at a time to avoid all four reeds dying at the same time.\no  Students should soak reeds as described in #5 in the previous section.  Reeds\nshould not be soaked for too long; otherwise, they will become waterlogged.\no  Students should play on each new reed for no longer than five minutes.  If the\ntip becomes transparent, then the student should switch reeds.  The reed\nshould not become waterlogged, and it should not be used when playing in\nextreme registers.\no  After following this procedure for three days, students can start playing on the\nreeds for a longer period of time.  As this takes place, students and teachers\ncan start to judge the sound quality of the reed and make any necessary\nadjustments.\nTricks for Adjusting Poor Quality Reeds  **secrets that students need not know….with\nthe exception being very advanced HS students\n•  Every reed is different and will sound different.\n•  Students should learn to be picky about the sound quality of reeds.\n•  When dealing with a reed that is too soft:\no  Move the reed up on the mouthpiece slightly.  This is only a temporary “quick\nfix” if there are no other reeds available.  The ligature can also be raised\nslightly on the reed/mouthpiece.  Do not raise the ligature above the bark\n(polished bottom part) of the reed.\no  Clip the reed using a reed clipper.  This cuts off part of the tip of the reed.\nOnly an experienced lesson teacher or a very knowledgeable band director\nshould be clipping reeds.\no  Set the reed aside and let it sit/age.  Time and weather will change the quality\nof a reed.\no  Colder climates make certain reeds sound thinner.  Students may need to wait\nfor warmer weather before coming back to that particular reed.\nWhen dealing with a reed that is too hard:\no  For mildly hard reeds, “polish” the reed on a sheet of paper. Place the flat part\nof a reed (not the side with bark) on the paper and press/rub in circles with 2\nor 3 fingers. This must be done on a flat surface.\no  For mildly hard reeds, the reed can be lowered slightly on the mouthpiece so\nthat the thinner part of the reed is being played. Be aware, however, that this is\nonly a quick fix. The ligature can also be moved slightly lower on the\nreed/mouthpiece, if necessary.\no  For slightly harder reeds, sand down the flat part of the reed with 600 grit sand\npaper (or finer). The reed must then be polished.\no  For very hard reeds:\n(cid:2)  Determine which side of the reed is harder.\n(cid:2)  Play on the left and right side to see which side is more difficult to\nproduce a sound on.\n(cid:2)  Use a reed knife and scrape off wood from both sides surrounding the\nheart. Do not scrape off the tip or the heart of the reed. Remove\nmore cane from the thicker side.  Be very careful not to scrape off too\nmuch.\no  Again, only an experienced lesson teacher or a very knowledgeable band\ndirector should be scraping reeds.\no  Try pushing on the tip of the reed with the thumb while it is on the\nmouthpiece. Close the tip opening and then press a little more 2-3 times.\nCheck to see if the reed is softer.\no  Ask an older/more experienced private lesson teachers for even more tricks\nthat may be out there!\no  Sometimes a student is simply dealing with a bad reed………and throwing it\naway is easier than the frustration caused by the many attempts to fix/adjust\nthe reed. (cid:1)\nCLARINET EMBOUCHURE\n•  Students must be able to use air correctly before beginning to learn the\nclarinet embouchure.\n•  Use the mouthpiece and barrel for better control.\n•  The teacher should place the mouthpiece in the beginning.\n•  Some teachers prefer to place the mouthpiece against the upper teeth first; others\nprefer to place the bottom lip first, and then the upper teeth and top lip. The latter\nis preferred.\n•  The student needs to remember how it feels and sounds.\n•  Once the teacher has demonstrated how it feels and sounds, the student can hold\nthe  mouthpiece  and  barrel  in  place  and  watch  his  face  in  a  mirror  to  make  sure\nnothing  moves  or  looks  unnatural.    Then,  the  student  remembers  how  it  looks,\nfeels and sounds.\nIt is best to hold the mouthpiece with two fingers and a thumb at the very bottom\nof the barrel.  The fingers should have absolutely no contact with the mouthpiece\nor ligature.\n•  The mouthpiece is held by the teeth, not the lips.\n•  The upper teeth rest on the mouthpiece material (patch).\n•  The students must get used to having a lifting sensation against their upper teeth.\nUsing  rubber  gloves  (separate  for  each  student),  show  the  student  how  much\npressure they will feel.  Do not allow the student’s head to move at all.\n•  The lower teeth feel the reed through the lower lip that covers them.\n•  The lower lip covers the lower teeth like a fitted sheet covers a mattress.\n•  The back teeth are naturally apart.\n•  The tongue is in the “li” position…..slightly up, but not pulled back.\n•  Using the index finger, gently push the lower lip toward, but not rolled\nover the lower teeth.  Lick the part that goes over.  That is the correct amount.\n•  The bottom teeth should not respond to the placement of the mouthpiece by\nmoving backwards, and may move slightly forward to create a smooth area\nin the chin called the valley.  The student should not feel any tension in his jaw\nas the mouthpiece is placed on his bottom lip.\n•  The  corners  are  toward  the  mouthpiece.    Ultimately,  the  corners  will  be  toward\nthe mouthpiece and down.\n•  There should be no wrinkles in the lower lip, and red flesh must be seen\non either side of the mouthpiece.\n•  The lower lip that is not under the reed stays in front of the teeth.\n•  Never tell students to pull their lips over their teeth.  Pulling and stretching makes\nlips thicker.\n•  The upper lip rests on top of the mouthpiece in front of the upper teeth.\n•  The upper lip should be soft and pliable, and follow the shape/contour of the\n•  Both the top and bottom lip should always feel soft and natural.\n•  There should be no lines or dimples that do not appear in the natural face.  The\nface essentially should be “zombie”-like.\n•  The air is directed at the clarinet, not into it.\n•  The air is focused to an imaginary dot in the middle of the reed where the flat\npart meets the tip.\n•  The teacher can help the student feel how the lip, the lifting and the valley feel.\n•  Enough mouthpiece must be past the lips into the chamber of the mouth to allow\nthe reed to freely vibrate.\n•  As the student focuses the air at the “dot”, an instant vibration should occur.\n•  There must be a resonant fifth line treble clef concert F# sounded.\nIf the sound is stuffy, the student may be holding the mouthpiece with the lips.\nIf the sound is strident and brittle, the student may have too much mouthpiece\nin his mouth or may be using too much unfocused air.\n•  Be sure the student can control the air well enough to find the correct balance of\nair and resistance to create the sound you want on the mouthpiece and barrel.\n•  Remember that the mouth can be too open; the teeth can be out of position; the\nlips can be too loose and puffy or can grip; the tongue can be too far back in the\nmouth; the student can be lifting too little.  All of these will result in a sound you\nwill not wish to create.\n•  Keep making subtle adjustments to the angle, amount of mouthpiece taken, etc.\nJust a slight movement can really improve the resonance of the vibration.\n•  Keep the body and face calm and still while learning this embouchure.\n•  The embouchure is a constant work in progress.  Special attention should be given\nto the contact of the upper teeth with the mouthpiece material.  The teacher can\nattempt to move the mouthpiece out of position to make the student aware that\nsomething is incorrect.\nIt is easier to make something firmer than to get rid of unnecessary tightness.\nIf the sound is not clear, instant and resonant on the mouthpiece, the sound on\nthe clarinet will not be resonant and beautiful.\n•  When  the  barrel  is  placed  on  the  clarinet,  the  first  attempt  at  sound  production\nshould be made with the teacher holding the instrument for the student.  This will\nbe demonstrated.\n•  Trade back and forth with the teacher holding: the student holding: etc.\nMAKING THE FIRST CLARINET MOUTHPIECE\nAND BARREL SOUND\nInitial sound production cannot be introduced until correct posture and breathing\nhas been successfully taught.  Include these two essential components as “part” of\nthe first sound attempt(s).\n•  Relax position and ready position should already be taught and drilled prior to\nsound production.  As sound production is occurring, playing position must be\nincorporated.  Students need to understand that ready position means they are\nready to play.  Playing position means that they are set (physically) to play.\nStudents should not be allowed to sit in relax position during class, except maybe\nduring announcements, paperwork or things not pertaining to playing.  If one\nword instructions are preferred, then use “ready” and “set.”\n•  Try to get every student to make a sound on the first day of sound production.  If\nyou will not be able to accomplish this, make a disclaimer before you start.  The\nstudents who do not end up getting to make their first sound—on the first day—\nwill be the first students you will start with on the second day!  Students should\nnot be surprised or frustrated if you do not get to them on this first day.\n•  On day one of sound production, make another disclaimer if you suspect that you\nwill not get far enough along to allow any of the students to take home their “set-\nup”.\n•  At the end of each class, you must make the decision to allow just those who you\nassisted to take home their set-up…….or not allow set-ups to go home until\neveryone has made sounds with your assistance (day one, day two, etc.).\n•  Once you allow and require set-ups to go home on a daily basis, students should\nbe recording their practice time on whatever form of practice card you are using.\nBe realistic when designating ____ minutes to be spent on their set-up sounds\nduring their home practice.\nIt is not necessary to have students make sounds on just the mouthpiece (without\nthe barrel).  It will be much easier for you……and eventually less awkward for\nthe students…….to hold the mouthpiece and barrel.  If you choose to start on just\nthe mouthpiece, then you are encouraged to add the barrel very soon.\n•  Do not use a metronome when assisting students to make their first sounds.  A\nmetronome should not be added until the class is at the point of making group\nsounds.\n•  Remind students that lipstick, Chapstick, etc. cannot be worn during class.\nStudents need to understand that their reeds will not last long, and they will begin\nto see mold.  (cid:1)\n•  When working one-on-one with students in your beginning class, it is important\nthat the students are ready as soon as the teacher reaches them.  While other\nstudents are waiting, they must either be paying attention to what you are\ndoing…..or working on a music theory worksheet, etc.\n•  While going around the room, students should not be allowed to make sounds on\ntheir set-up—even if they have already been assisted.  They should also not be\nallowed to improperly hold their set-up (i.e. putting a finger in the bottom of their\nbarrel…..twirling or playing with the set-up in general……etc.)\n•  The instructor must place all mouthpiece and barrels for students.  This may\ncontinue for 2-5 days (if not longer), depending on the size and overall ability\nlevel of your class.\n•  You should be directly in front of each individual student when assisting them,\nand not to the side. It would be most effective if students were standing and\n“finding their horizon.”  Music stands should be elevated to the proper height, and\na mirror should be properly positioned on each stand.  You will learn to maneuver\naround each student’s equipment, etc.  At this point, all cases should be directly\nunder or to the side of their chairs.\n•  As you are working with each student, your goal is to assist each student in\nmaking a quality sound on or in the vicinity of the correct pitch (fifth line F-\nsharp).  Do not get on to students who do not produce the exact pitch—especially\nif they are using brands of mouthpieces and ligatures that may be inferior and/or\nnot on your recommended list.  When listening to each student, listen for:\no  quality of sound\no  consistency of sound\no  pitch\n•  Unless the clarinet is your primary instrument, you should not be modeling\nsounds on the set-up.  As you assist each student, you will eventually find a “star\nstudent” who will become the model for future reference.  Be sure to periodically\nuse a keyboard or a metronome—with pitches—so as not to “lose sight” of the\ncorrect pitch (regardless of whether or not a model is used).\n•  Be aware of fragile and/or teary-eyed students. Move on to the next student in the\ninterest of time, but make an effort to return to these students by the end of class.\nDo not let a student leave class feeling unsuccessful.  If possible, offer a pass for\nstruggling students to come in at lunch or before/after school.\n•  The set-up always goes to the student; not the student to the set-up.\n•  Before bringing the set-up to the student, check for:\nligatures that have been placed correctly\nligature screws that are too tight\no\no  proper mouthpiece angles\no  proper alignment of the reed\no  condition of reeds\n•  Train students not to move their faces or body when you are placing the set-up. It\nmay take certain students multiple tries, and if they move after each attempt, they\n(and you!) basically have to start over each time.\n•  When students breathe, do not allow their corners to pull back at all.\nFurthermore, upper lips should not be coming off the plastic of the tops of the\nmouthpieces.  Students should breathe only through their corners, keeping their\nupper lips on the tops of the mouthpieces.\n•  With the set-up, students should progress through the following steps:\no  air (The sound starts and ends with air, making students aware of how\nthey can control their air.  This also helps students avoid undue tightness\nin the embouchure.)\no  air~vibration~air (The air “turns into” a vibration and returns to air.)\no  air~vibration\no  vibration (ultimate “final” sound)\n•  No articulation syllable should be used when making set-up sounds.  The ultimate\ngoal is for students to start their sounds with air.  An articulation syllable will be\nassigned after all students are making characteristic and consistent sounds on the\nset-up, as well as the fully-assembled clarinet.\n•  Students need to direct their air across their reed (to the imaginary dot) in order to\nachieve the desired sound.\n•  Make sure the students understand that “a sound” may not happen the very first\ntime. This is a trial and error process and may take multiple tries.\n•  Once the set-up has been placed correctly and students are making the sound you\nwant, they need to remember:\no  how it looks (by looking in the mirror)\no  how it feels\nAllow and instruct them to take the set-up from your hand without moving their\nbody and embouchure.  Have them try to reproduce the sound on their own.  Be\nprepared to further assist them if necessary.  When the sound is correct, students\nneed to remember how it sounds.\n•  Train students to freeze their body, face and embouchure at the end of whatever\ntype of sound is being made (whether it is air, a tone, etc.)  The student should not\nmove anything until the director calls the students to ready position.  This aspect\nof playing should transfer to any—and everything students play in the future (i.e.\nafter last notes of lines out of the book, last notes of songs, etc.)\n•  Whether students are making individual or group sounds, they need to stop when\nthey feel like they are running out of air.  It should never be thought of as a\ncontest to see who can hold their sounds the longest.  That serves absolutely no\nbenefit.\nIf a student feels dizzy or faint, allow them to bend over in their chair for a little\nwhile until they feel better.\nIf you feel or hear air escaping from the student’s embouchure, the student is most\nlikely not sealing properly.  This is usually caused by students pulling their\ncorners back.  Students need to constantly be told to bring their corners forward.\nAfter a student has been made aware that they are leaking air, the expectation\nshould be stated for the student to return to class the next day without that issue.\n•  While students are playing, it may be necessary to gently wiggle their mouthpiece\nfrom side to side, during which you will hear pitch variation.  This is simply\nmaking the student aware that their corners are not firm and/or their top teeth are\nnot on the top of the mouthpiece.  Ultimately, you should not be able to move the\nmouthpiece at all.\n•  The teacher should always forewarn a student before removing the mouthpiece\nfrom the student’s mouth.  The mouthpiece can easily scrape the teeth or create\ndiscomfort.\nIf you are too easily able to slide the mouthpiece out of a student’s mouth, their\ntop teeth are most likely not on the top of the mouthpiece like they should be.\nThis also means that students are holding the mouthpiece with their lips instead of\ntheir teeth.\n•  Extraneous noises at ends of sounds are a result of students collapsing their\nembouchures and/or postures.  Have students sing “la” or “dah”; then, apply that\nto the end of their sound.\nIt is your job, as the teacher, to diagnose any problems through this trial and error\nprocess.  As you go around the room, it may be helpful to you to take written\nnotes on students having problems.  Jot down any catchphrases, analogies or\nspecific things that you said to them that helped them in any way!\nIf you are struggling in your efforts to assist multiple students…..or are unsure\nabout what you are doing in general, then hire an outside consultant or\nexperienced private lesson teacher to come to your class and help.  As this\nprofessional goes around the room to hear your students, you need to follow\nthem……watch exactly what they are doing…..and take notes as well.  No\nmatter the scenario, reference these notes as you see fit in future classes.\nIf you have a large class, it may be necessary for “waiting” students to re-soak\ntheir reeds after ________ students have played.\n•  After _____ days, students will eventually need to be able to place their set-up\nand make a sound without your assistance.  The amount of time will vary year to\nyear, taking into consideration the size of the class, the overall quality of their\nsounds, and how many times you have assisted the students.\n•  Students playing bass clarinet need to use the mouthpiece and neck for sound\nproduction.  The neck should be held by the curve closest to the mouthpiece,\navoiding the register key mechanism.  Whether or not the instrument provided to\nthe student has a Charles Bay neck, the angle of the instrument (and the angle of\nthe mouthpiece when not yet on the instrument) must be similar as possible to the\nangle of a B-flat clarinet.\n•  Students need to constantly be reminded that characteristic and consistent\nset-up sounds are stepping stones to making sounds on the fully-assembled\nclarinet!  Students who do not practice their set-up sounds at home are not\nonly slowing the class down, but are not contributing to the daily progress\nand quality of the class.\n**Much of this information is applicable to beginner interviews.\nCHARACTERISTICS OF A GOOD\nCLARINET SOUND\nResonant\nConsistent\nRelaxed\nFull\nRich\nClear\nSmooth\nFocused\nVibrant\nCentered\nBuoyant\nOpen\nFree\nCLARINET OPEN G THREE-POSITION EXERCISE\n1.  POSITION 1 – “baby position”\n•  This newly-created “baby position” now becomes the students’ new “ready\nposition.”\n•  Notice that no fingers are placed on the tone holes.\n•  The left hand is lightly grasping the barrel and the right hand is lightly grasping\nthe bell.\n•  Be sure to check the angle of the clarinet; the bell should not be past the knees\nand students should always be feeling a lifting sensation against their upper teeth.\nTherefore students are recreating the angle of their “short instrument” (set-up).\n•  The student’s head is level and the instrument is brought to them.\n•  Each student should be heard individually in this position to ensure they are all\nproducing a 2nd line G.\n2.  POSTION 2 – Slide the right hand into the correct position.\n*You must have taught hand position by this point.*\n•  Students should quickly slide their right hand up into position without pressing\nany keys down.\n•  This should be drilled until you are confident they can perform this action\ncorrectly.\n•  This position should not disrupt the placement of the instrument at all.\n•  Again, make sure the bell does not go past the knees and students should still be\nfeeling a lifting sensation against their upper teeth.\n•  Again, students must always look out at their horizon and not attempt to look\ndown to see if their right hand fingers are in the correct place.\n•  Each student should again be heard individually in this position to ensure they are\nstill producing a 2nd line G.\n•  Be aware that students can accidently press down any finger --or combination of\nfingers --and still unfortunately be able to sound their 2nd line G.\n3.  POSITION 3 – Slide the left hand into the correct position.\n•  Students should quickly slide their left hand down into this position without\npressing any keys. If any keys are pressed, the instrument will produce “mystery\nsounds.”\ndown to see if their left hand fingers are in the correct place.\nDrilling and monitoring of these steps will result in correct instrument carriage as well as\nhand/finger position. When the three steps are mastered, the students should progress to\nthe completed Three-Position Open G Exercise (next page).\nCOMPLETED THREE-POSITION OPEN G EXERCISE\nSLIDE\nRELEASE\nBREATHE\n•  The first whole note should be performed in POSITION 1.\n•  The first whole rest should be performed as follows:\no  Beat 1 – Release\no  Beat 2 – Slide right hand up into the correct position\no  Beat 3 and 4 – Breathe\n•  The second whole note should be performed in POSITION 2.\n•  The second whole rest should be  performed as follows:\no  Beat 2 – Slide left hand down into the correct position\n•  The third and final whole note is now performed in POSITION 3 with absolute\nand correct hand/finger position.\nIf “mystery sounds” are still heard in POSITION 3 after several days, students\nare simply not aware of what is happening with their left hand fingers (especially\nthe thumb).\nCLARINET OCTAVE EXERCISES\nLevel 1\n(cid:2)\n(cid:1) (cid:2)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)(cid:4)\n(cid:1) (cid:3)\n(cid:1) (cid:3)(cid:4)\n(cid:5)\nLevel 2\nCLARINET – TEACHING FINGERINGS AND\nUSING FINGERING CHARTS\nIt is your choice whether or not you use the fingering chart in your book with your\n•  When you begin learning new notes, learn only a few notes per day.\no  DO NOT overwhelm your students!!\n•  Upper register notes should not be attempted until you have taught all necessary\nflexibility exercises in order to perform register slurs (12ths) and harmonics (Sets 1, 2, 3,\n7, 8).

This also can be used as a Pre-Set to “CLARINET SET 1.”\nCLARINET – WORKING OUT BLIPS AND\nFINGER/TONGUE COORDINATION PROBLEMS\nBlips\nBlips can be defined as the uncoordinated movement of multiple fingers that should\nbe moving at the same time—but are not.  As with the teaching of all woodwind\ninstruments, the most problematic fingers in both hands are the ring finger and the\npinky.  Most blips occur with the use of either or both of these fingers.\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 1-2 involve moving\neither the LH/RH ring finger and pinky at the same time.\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 3-4 involve moving\neither the LH/RH middle finger, ring finger, and pinky at the same time.\n•  For lines 1-4:\n•  Students should articulate every note.\n•  Students can audiate the counting while they are positioning.\n•  Students can audiate the note names while they are positioning.\n•  Students can audiate “long…short long….short long…short long,” while\nthey are positioning.\nIn the event you have not yet taught dotted rhythms to your students, these\nexercises are already reinforcing a very challenging rhythm--in general--\nthat students will encounter all the way through their public school\nexperience.\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 5-6 involve moving\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 7-8 involve moving\n•  For lines 5-8:\n•  Students should slur every note.\n•  Students can perform these exercises without articulating.\n•  Using the same note names as lines 1-8, lines 9-12 are notated with the\nrhythms inverted.\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 9-10 involve moving\n•  Lines 11-12 involve moving either the LH/RH middle finger, ring finger, and\npinky at the same time.\n•  For lines 9-12:\n•  Students can audiate “short long…short long….short long…short,” while\n•  Using the same note names as lines 1-8, lines 13-16 are notated with the\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 13-14 involve moving\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 15-16 involve moving\n•  For lines 13-16:\nMISCELLANEOUS\n•  These exercises can be very effective, but must be audiated--in the various\nways previously discussed--and positioned at the same time.\n•  Playing tests can and should be given on these exercises to promote their\nregular practice.\n•  While positioning and/or performing these lines, it is imperative that students’\nfingers are hovering and staying very close to the keys.  If students’ fingers\nare too far away from the keys, these exercises will not be effective in\npreventing blips.\n•  Fingering patterns found in these exercises will more than likely appear in\nvirtually every genre of music, whether it be scales, All-Region/All-State\netudes, performance music, etc.\nFinger/Tongue Coordination Problems\nThere are two types of finger/tongue coordination problems that occur when passages are\narticulated:\n1.  students changing to the next fingering before they articulate (most common)\n2.  students articulating before they change to the next fingering\n•  Students can audiate the counting.\n•  Students can audiate the note names.\n•  Students can use their air and position through their embouchures—without\nactually producing sounds/vibrations.\nCLARINET THROAT TONES\nOn the clarinet, G, G#, A, and Bb in the staff are generally considered the open throat\ntones for the instrument. This means that when playing these notes, you are plugging very\nfew (if any) holes, and are usually only opening more. The air in the clarinet is going to\ntravel less and with barely any resonance in the clarinet. These notes will typically be\nsharp…..especially when sustained with other instruments sustaining the same pitch.\nPlaying throat tones with the characteristic sound and pitch takes years of practice and\nmuscle training.\n•  Have the students use very fast air on their open G. They need to try to relax their\nthroat so it is nice and open while not losing the embouchure.  When this is\nachieved, then they can apply this skill to the other three notes.\n•  It is important that students’ oral cavity is very “tall.”\n•  The teeth need to be apart in the back of the mouth.\n•  Students should think of having an egg on the back of their tongue….and if they\nclose off too much, the egg will break.\n•  Very fast air is required.\nAlternate Fingerings (not to be taught in 6th grade…but these fingerings will\nassist in improving the intonation)\n•  If sharp, add finger 6 and right pinky 1 in the right hand\n•  If still sharp, add finger 5 in the right hand\n•  If still sharp, add finger 4 in the right hand\n•  If still sharp, add finger 3 in the left hand\n•  If still sharp, add finger 2 in the left hand\nCLARINET ARTICULATION\n•  Do not attempt to teach articulation until all students are producing characteristic\nand consistent sounds on the mouthpiece and barrel, as well as the entire clarinet.\nIntroduce articulation on the mouthpiece and barrel.\n•  The tongue is down 98% and up 2% of the time.\n•  The tongue moves up and down, not back and forth.\n•  The tongue never touches the teeth or gums.\n•  The  purpose  of  the  tongue  is  to  release  the  air  which  causes  the  reed  to  vibrate\nwhich  creates  the  sound.    The  tongue’s  release  of  the  air  simply  defines  the\nbeginning/start of the vibration/sound.\n•  Articulation  is  used  to  define  the  vibrations  necessary  to  create  musical  rhythm,\nstyle  and  movement--to  contrast  the  use  of  slurring  (which  also  creates  similar\nmusical entities).\n•  One taste bud of the student’s tongue should touch the flat part of the reed\nwhere the imaginary “dot” at the tip has been all along.  The tongue touches this\nspot, and immediately returns to its “at rest” position.\n•  The student must always touch and interrupt a vibrating reed.\n•  The articulation does not stop the reed vibration.\n•  There should be no movement in the face, chin or throat.  All that moves when the\nstudent articulates is the air and the tongue.\n•  The tongue must touch in the same spot with the same strength/energy every time.\nThe spot should be where the flat part of the reed meets the tip.\nYOU WILL NOW BE SHOWN COMBINED EXERCISES THAT WILL HELP\nIMPROVE THE STUDENT’S TONE QUALITY IN ALL OF THE REGISTERS,\nINCREASE RANGE, CREATE EVEN ARTICULATION IN ALL REGISTERS,\nAND TEACH YOUNG STUDENTS HOW TO CONTROL THE ENTIRE\nINSTRUMENT DURING THE FIRST YEAR.\nCLARINET ARTICULATION EXERCISES\n•  When starting articulation exercises, the use of mirrors is vital.\n•  Remind students that the tongue only interrupts the air – it never stops the air.\n•  Articulating with black notes as opposed to white notes, encourages students to move\ntheir tongues down quicker.\n•  Make sure from the very beginning, students sing and play in a connected/legato style.\n•  Exercises to be taught in the following order:\n1.  Have students sing on “dah” and then ultimately on the French syllable “dih.”  If\nstudents are unable to sing in a connected style, they should not progress to the next\nstep.\n2.  Have students put their hand or index finger in front of their face and feel their air.\nStudents should feel continuous air and not “puffs” of air.\n3.  Go around the room and have each student tongue air at your hand, so you can assess\ntheir ability to do it correctly.\n4.  Using a mirror, students should articulate with or without their hand/index finger,\nmaking sure that their face, chin, and throat are not moving.\n5.  When you feel students have mastered the previous exercises, allow them to articulate\n– using the syllable “dah” or “dih” – on the mouthpiece and barrel.  Students should\nput their left hands under their barrel so they can feel a continuous stream of air while\nthey are articulating.  Students who do not feel continuous air need to be verbally\nmade aware that they are not articulating correctly.\n** Students should start with their tongue on the reed to create the articulation.\nThe tongue then falls down and returns to its “at rest” position in the bottom of the\nmouth.  One taste bud of the student’s tongue should touch the flat part of the reed,\nwhere the imaginary “dot” at the tip has been all along.  The air and tongue go to\nthis same “dot.”\n6.  Allow students to articulate as fast as they can.\n7.  Allow the students to start the sound and use the \"ta-day\" syllable.\n8.  Allow the students to start the sound and articulate by snapping your finger on\ncommand.\n9.  With the metronome, begin to incorporate easy follow-the-leader rhythms with you\nsinging or modeling – and the students echoing on their mouthpiece and barrel.\nWhole rests may or may not be necessary between you and the students.  As with\nyour initial sound production exercises, students need to continue counting with their\nfingers while they are playing.  This ensures that students are thinking internal\nsubdivision.\n10. Before progressing to the fully-assembled clarinet, assign the following playing test\non the mouthpiece and barrel:\n•  Attach the mouthpiece and barrel to the clarinet and begin articulation.  Students must be\nconstantly reminded that they should be articulating in the same way as they were when\njust using the mouthpiece and barrel.\n•  Whether students are playing white notes or black notes, they must constantly be\nreminded that the tongue moves down quickly.\n•  When students can successfully sing note names on the same pitch, allow them to\narticulate multiple notes on the same pitch.\n•  When pulse and foot pat are learned, students articulate every time their foot touches the\nfloor – and then when their foot touches the floor and as it comes up.\n•  Once the student is able to read music, call the articulation \"rhythmic articulation\".\nStudents should be tonguing as the music moves across the page.\n•  Do not allow students to articulate back-to-back notes on different pitches until they are\nplaying with absolute connected style on notes of the same pitch.\n•  When the tongue is moving correctly, you must decide when it is appropriate to have\nstudents begin coordinating finger movement with articulation.\n•  When students articulate back-to-back notes on different pitches, they cannot stop their\nair as they change fingerings.\n•  Teach Mary Had a Little Lamb in four segments by singing and then playing:\n•  After all students have successfully played each segment of Mary Had a Little Lamb,\nbegin to string together the segments into the following finished product:\n•  Ultimately, students should be able to execute any or all of the following on a daily basis:\no  articulate as fast as they can\no  articulate using the \"ta-day\" syllable\no  articulate on command\no  articulate with foot pat and articulate rhythms\n•  When playing exercises out of the method book, you can return to previously-learned\nlines and add articulation.  Do not feel like all lines must be executed again during class;\nassign students to perform all lines at home with articulation.\nCLARINET-LEVELS OF ACHIEVEMENT FOR\nARTICULATION\nIntroduces skill of tonguing and finger change at the same time\nIntroduces skill of tonguing and multiple finger changes within a measure\n4 Teaching Techniques\n1.

    "text": "SOAKING, BREAKING IN AND ADJUSTING REEDS\nSoaking Reeds\n•  Soak/break in the very first reed…. for several minutes…. together in class while\nthe teacher is closely monitoring the students.  Following this process, the teacher\nshould assign three additional reeds to be broken in for homework.  With that said,\nreed guards should be going home with students each and every day—whether or not\nthe entire instrument is going home.\n1.  Remove the reed from the plastic reed holder.  The left hand should hold the plastic\nreed holder, with the thumb on the reed guard logo.  The right hand thumb and index\nfinger should carefully slide the reed out of the plastic reed holder, with the tip\ncoming out first.\n2.  Hold the reed with the thumb on the words and the index finger on the back.\n3.  Lay the reed on the tongue.  Talk to students about the unusual taste of the reed, and\nassure them that with time, this process will become second nature.\n4.  Draw the tongue in.  The teeth should not have any contact with the reed.\n5.  Place the reed in the mouth to moisten and smooth the top and bottom of it.\nMoistening the bottom (butt) of the reed helps create a seal around the mouthpiece,\nwhich will result in better response.\n6.  Flatten the tip of the reed by putting the side with words on the table (flat part of the\nmouthpiece).  Place the thumb on the on the tip of the reed, (which is now on the\ntable) and wiggle the reed back and forth to get any warps out.  This helps with over-\nall reed vibration.\n7.  Vacuum reeds at the end of class (have students suck air through the mouthpiece to\neliminate water on the reed).\n8.  At the end of each class period/practice session, suck the air through the mouthpiece\nto eliminate water on the reed.  Reeds can now be “vacuumed” by carefully removing\nthe reed through the lips.  Reeds can furthermore be blotted on shorts/jeans/etc.  This\nwill eliminate excessive saliva to remain on the reed…which will eventually mold if\nnot vacuumed.  (cid:1)\n9.  With the plastic reed holder held in the same manner as discussed in #1, carefully\nslide the butt of the reed into the reed guard first, so that the tip is not destroyed.\nBreaking in Reeds\n•  There are two specific reasons why breaking in reeds is important:\n1.  so reeds last longer\n2.  so students will always have reeds on hand\n•  There is a process involved to properly and effectively break in a reed:\no  Break in two to four reeds at a time.  Most reed guards have four slots.  Break\nin two reeds at a time to avoid all four reeds dying at the same time.\no  Students should soak reeds as described in #5 in the previous section.  Reeds\nshould not be soaked for too long; otherwise, they will become waterlogged.\no  Students should play on each new reed for no longer than five minutes.  If the\ntip becomes transparent, then the student should switch reeds.  The reed\nshould not become waterlogged, and it should not be used when playing in\nextreme registers.\no  After following this procedure for three days, students can start playing on the\nreeds for a longer period of time.  As this takes place, students and teachers\ncan start to judge the sound quality of the reed and make any necessary\nadjustments.\nTricks for Adjusting Poor Quality Reeds  **secrets that students need not know….with\nthe exception being very advanced HS students\n•  Every reed is different and will sound different.\n•  Students should learn to be picky about the sound quality of reeds.\n•  When dealing with a reed that is too soft:\no  Move the reed up on the mouthpiece slightly.  This is only a temporary “quick\nfix” if there are no other reeds available.  The ligature can also be raised\nslightly on the reed/mouthpiece.  Do not raise the ligature above the bark\n(polished bottom part) of the reed.\no  Clip the reed using a reed clipper.  This cuts off part of the tip of the reed.\nOnly an experienced lesson teacher or a very knowledgeable band director\nshould be clipping reeds.\no  Set the reed aside and let it sit/age.  Time and weather will change the quality\n•\nof a reed.\no  Colder climates make certain reeds sound thinner.  Students may need to wait\nfor warmer weather before coming back to that particular reed.\nWhen dealing with a reed that is too hard:\no  For mildly hard reeds, “polish” the reed on a sheet of paper. Place the flat part\nof a reed (not the side with bark) on the paper and press/rub in circles with 2\nor 3 fingers. This must be done on a flat surface.\no  For mildly hard reeds, the reed can be lowered slightly on the mouthpiece so\nthat the thinner part of the reed is being played. Be aware, however, that this is\nonly a quick fix. The ligature can also be moved slightly lower on the\nreed/mouthpiece, if necessary.\no  For slightly harder reeds, sand down the flat part of the reed with 600 grit sand\npaper (or finer). The reed must then be polished.\no  For very hard reeds:\n(cid:2)  Determine which side of the reed is harder.\n(cid:2)  Play on the left and right side to see which side is more difficult to\nproduce a sound on.\n(cid:2)  Use a reed knife and scrape off wood from both sides surrounding the\nheart. Do not scrape off the tip or the heart of the reed. Remove\nmore cane from the thicker side.  Be very careful not to scrape off too\nmuch.\no  Again, only an experienced lesson teacher or a very knowledgeable band\ndirector should be scraping reeds.\no  Try pushing on the tip of the reed with the thumb while it is on the\nmouthpiece. Close the tip opening and then press a little more 2-3 times.\nCheck to see if the reed is softer.\no  Ask an older/more experienced private lesson teachers for even more tricks\nthat may be out there!\no  Sometimes a student is simply dealing with a bad reed………and throwing it\naway is easier than the frustration caused by the many attempts to fix/adjust\nthe reed.

    "text": "BEGINNING CLARINET CLASSROOM AND\nENSEMBLE SET-UP\nBeginning Classroom Set-Up\n•  Your beginning clarinet class should be taught in the band hall.\n•  Configure your classroom based on how many students you have in the class.  Unless you\nhave an unusually small class—in which case it can be taught in an ensemble room.\n•  Start off the semester by putting students in alphabetical order so you can learn their\nnames faster.  Once music stands and mirrors are utilized in class, hanging name tags can\ncontinue to help you learn student names quicker. These can and should also be used on\nany days you have clinicians/consultants visit.\nTypes of Classroom Set-Ups\n1.  Arched set-up\n(cid:1)\nIf using your “ensemble set-up” for your class, have students sit in a “box,” so all\nstudents receive the same amount of attention/eye contact from you.\n(cid:1)  Have students sit in every other chair (if all chairs have to remain in your set-up\nthroughout the day).\n(cid:1)  The aisles between your rows must be large enough so that you will have quick and\neasy access to any student--both from the front and the back.\nIf you end up needing to use risers, make sure the backings are on them for safety\nreasons. If the risers do not come with backings, you can enlist the help of either a\nband dad or your woodshop teacher to install backings.\n(cid:1)  As much as possible, have students in “windows.”\n(cid:1)  You must be able to see each student from the front and the back.  With that said, you\nare not always able to correct student’s posture, hand position, etc. from the front of\nthe room; thus, you need to be walking around the room instead of “parking” on a\nstool!\n(cid:1)  Once you start determining playing ability levels of your students, place weaker\nplayers in the front of the classroom and stronger players in the back. Less attention is\ntypically given to players who are further back in the set-up.\n2.  Horseshoe set-up\n(cid:1)  This set-up is not recommended--why? Because you have a limited range of vision.\nIf you decide to use this set-up, you will need to pull the stand/podium far enough\nback in order to have clear vision of every student.\n3.  Arched with aisle\n(cid:1)  This is a very acceptable set-up, even with full ensembles.\n4.  Straight line set-up\n(cid:1)  These should only be used with bigger facilities.\nIn order for you to have visual contact with all of the students, the students on the\nends of the rows will have to adjust their chairs/bodies towards you or you need to\nhave them sitting in a “box” (see arched set-up).\n5.  Straight line set-up with aisle\n6.  Circular set up\n(cid:1)  One teacher teaches from the inside and one from the periphery. Students face in\ntowards middle.\nIf you are teaching alone, it will be too hard to maneuver when teaching outside of\nthe circle.\n(cid:1)  This set-up is typical in elementary school cafeterias or small stage “cafetoriums”.\n7.  Have beginners only sit on right side of your band set-up.\n(cid:1)  This would assume that your flute and French horn players sit on the left side of your\nset-up.\nFull Ensemble Set-Up\n•  Again, clarinet players need to be on the opposite side of the ensemble as the flute and\nFrench horn players.\n•  First chairs need to sit together so they can more easily balance and match in terms of\nbalance, pitch, etc.\n•\nIt is recommended to have no more than three clarinet players on first part; furthermore,\nhigh school literature may only need two clarinet players on first part.\nLow Cl. (Option 1)\nLow Cl. (Option 2)\n•  Bass clarinet players should never be placed with the low brass in the back of the\nensemble…regardless of whether or not risers are utilized.\nTrombone\nTuba\nBass Cl (cid:2)"

    "text": "CLARINET HAND POSITION\nRIGHT HAND POSITION\n1.  Place the right hand first, with the lower joint supported by the leg.  The right\nhand lifts the instrument, and the placement is less difficult or complicated.\nThe upper joint can be gently held by the left hand as you begin the awkward\nprocess of finding the correct place for every finger.\n2.  Place the fleshy finger pads over the silver rings first.  Without putting\npressure on the finger tips, feel the pads fall into the holes.\n3.  The hand will begin in a straight across angle, and will be in the “flat-C”\nposition…not too curved and not too straight.\n4.  Place the thumb on the thumb rest between the rest and the leg.  The thumb\nnail touches the rest. Very little (preferably, no) flesh will touch the thumb\nrest. The thumb joint must always be to the right of the thumb rest, never\nbehind it.\n5.  Turn the clarinet out in front of the student like a spyglass and make sure there\nis open space between the body of the clarinet and the hand.\n6.  The pinky rests on the most comfortable of the four keys it will use later in\nthis process (either key #1, which is the low F key—or key #2, which is the\nlow G#/Ab key). The pinky should not be straight; it needs to be curved.\nWatch for pinkies that disappear either under the clarinet or under the pinky\nkeys.\n7.  The middle finger will appear higher because it is longer than the other\nfingers.\n8.  No part of any finger should touch any rod.\n9.  Practice moving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.  Do not let\nthe other two knuckles move.  The finger pads should fall directly into the\nholes.  In the beginning the pinky can move up and down also.\n10. Lean the clarinet back on the left shoulder and look at the right hand fingers as\nyou do this. While doing this, the left hand must remain in its proper “baby\nposition” holding the upper joint.\n11. Make sure to feel all parts of the ring with the finger pads.\n12. Keep the right hand straight across the body of the clarinet for at least 6 to 8\nweeks before moving into the more correct angled position. This makes it\neasier for the ring finger and pinky to function more comfortably.\n13. Do not include side keys in the initial hand position information.  If asked, tell\nthem once the hands can move correctly using the rings and tone holes, they\nwill be allowed to learn to use the keys on the side.\nLEFT HAND POSITION  *critical and paramount to the success of playing\nthe clarinet\n1.  While holding the lower joint gently (not using correct hand position but the\nproper “baby” position) with the right hand as it rests on the leg, place the\nmiddle knuckle of the index finger on the G# key at the top of the upper joint.\nPlace the first knuckle on the A key with the fleshy part of the tip angled\ndown toward the first silver ring.  The teacher will have to identify these\n“named keys” for the student.\n2.  Place the middle finger over the second silver ring.\n3.  Place the ring finger over the third hole with no silver ring.\n4.  Place the thumb over the ring on the back of the upper joint with the fleshy\npart of the end being aware of the long, skinny key (register key).  The angle\nof the thumb should be at “1:00/2:00.”\n5.  The pinky will rest on the most comfortable of the four keys it will use later in\nthis process (either key #1, which is the low E key—or key #4, which is the\nlow C# key). The pinky should not be straight; it needs to be curved. Watch\nfor pinkies that disappear either under the clarinet or under the pinky keys.\n6.  Keep the hand in an adjusted “Flat-C” position and the wrist slightly up.  The\nwrist must stay in line with the rest of the forearm.\n7.  Continue to rest the clarinet on the leg and watch to see if the left hand\nfollows the line of the upper joint to form the angle of a “V” with the upper\njoint.\n8.  Do not allow the knuckles of the index finger to lose contact with the G# and\nA keys. For example, A should not be played without the index finger also\ntouching (not pressing) the G#/Ab key.\n9.  If the thumb is not being used to play specific sounds on the instrument it\nMUST NOT touch the body (wood) of the instrument.\n10. ALWAYS KEEP ONE HAND ON THE CLARINET AT ALL TIMES.\nNEVER SIMPLY LAY IT IN THE LAP.\n11. Beginners can have “fly-away” fingers in the beginning as long as they fall\nback down to the correct rings.  The exception is the left index finger.  If we\ntry to get them to keep their fingers in the “finished” position too soon, the\nhands can become too tense.  Always feel the palm of the hands to check for\nthe softness of the fingers.  There are more bones in this area of the hand than\nany other part of the body.  If the palm is soft, all other parts of the hand will\nbe as naturally soft as is possible.  The pinkies should have comfortable\n“home keys” they touch all of the time in the beginning stages.\n12.  Beginning clarinet hand position is very awkward, thus taking longer to\nachieve and more patience from the teacher and student is required.  Do not\nget in a hurry.\nFINGER EXERCISES\n1.  All fingers in each hand move together.  Call out the hand you wish to move.\nThe students move all of the fingers in that hand down to seat into the rings\nand tone holes.  The right hand thumb obviously does not ever move when the\nteacher asks for “RIGHT”, but the left hand thumb will move to its ring with\nthe fingers of the left hand when the teacher asks for “LEFT”.\n2.  Next, we move the fingers one at a time beginning with the left hand.  The\nthumb and first finger are already down in this exercise, and each additional\nfinger in both hands will be numbered two through six from top of the upper\njoint to the bottom of the lower joint. The fingers will move down or up\ndepending on their starting position, as the number is called by the teacher.\nWe do not use the pinkies when we first begin this exercise.  Later, they will\nbe numbered seven and eight.\n3.  Watch the fingers to see that they move smoothly, cover the holes, stay in\nnatural position and move up and down from the big knuckle only.  The\nstudent should understand that the movement is aided by the soft tissue of the\npalm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand.\n4.  Next, we move the fingers in combinations: one, two….one, two\nthree…….one, two, three, four……one, two, three, four, five…..one, two,\nthree, four, five, six………six, five, four, three, two, one……five, four, three,\ntwo, one…….four, three, two, one……three, two, one………two, one……\nLater in the development the thumb movement is added.\n5.  Using these exercises, the fingers move in all of the ways they move to play\nthe clarinet: all together, one at a time, and in combinations.\n6.  When learning to use the pinkies, we number the keys one through four.  The\nteacher calls out the number, and the student moves the pinky in either hand in\na circular motion to the numbered key.  Call the numbers in order: call the\nnumbers backward: call the numbers diagonally: call the numbers in any order\nyou wish.  Begin using the pinkies separately, and then show the students the\ncorrelation of the keys on the left and right side of the clarinet."

    "text": "MAKING THE FIRST CLARINET MOUTHPIECE\nAND BARREL SOUND\n•\nInitial sound production cannot be introduced until correct posture and breathing\nhas been successfully taught.  Include these two essential components as “part” of\nthe first sound attempt(s).\n•  Relax position and ready position should already be taught and drilled prior to\nsound production.  As sound production is occurring, playing position must be\nincorporated.  Students need to understand that ready position means they are\nready to play.  Playing position means that they are set (physically) to play.\nStudents should not be allowed to sit in relax position during class, except maybe\nduring announcements, paperwork or things not pertaining to playing.  If one\nword instructions are preferred, then use “ready” and “set.”\n•  Try to get every student to make a sound on the first day of sound production.  If\nyou will not be able to accomplish this, make a disclaimer before you start.  The\nstudents who do not end up getting to make their first sound—on the first day—\nwill be the first students you will start with on the second day!  Students should\nnot be surprised or frustrated if you do not get to them on this first day.\n•  On day one of sound production, make another disclaimer if you suspect that you\nwill not get far enough along to allow any of the students to take home their “set-\nup”.\n•  At the end of each class, you must make the decision to allow just those who you\nassisted to take home their set-up…….or not allow set-ups to go home until\neveryone has made sounds with your assistance (day one, day two, etc.).\n•  Once you allow and require set-ups to go home on a daily basis, students should\nbe recording their practice time on whatever form of practice card you are using.\nBe realistic when designating ____ minutes to be spent on their set-up sounds\nduring their home practice.\nIt is not necessary to have students make sounds on just the mouthpiece (without\nthe barrel).  It will be much easier for you……and eventually less awkward for\nthe students…….to hold the mouthpiece and barrel.  If you choose to start on just\nthe mouthpiece, then you are encouraged to add the barrel very soon.\n•  Do not use a metronome when assisting students to make their first sounds.  A\nmetronome should not be added until the class is at the point of making group\nsounds.\n•  Remind students that lipstick, Chapstick, etc. cannot be worn during class.\nStudents need to understand that their reeds will not last long, and they will begin\nto see mold.  (cid:1)\n•  When working one-on-one with students in your beginning class, it is important\nthat the students are ready as soon as the teacher reaches them.  While other\nstudents are waiting, they must either be paying attention to what you are\ndoing…..or working on a music theory worksheet, etc.\n•  While going around the room, students should not be allowed to make sounds on\ntheir set-up—even if they have already been assisted.  They should also not be\nallowed to improperly hold their set-up (i.e. putting a finger in the bottom of their\nbarrel…..twirling or playing with the set-up in general……etc.)\n•  The instructor must place all mouthpiece and barrels for students.  This may\ncontinue for 2-5 days (if not longer), depending on the size and overall ability\nlevel of your class.\n•  You should be directly in front of each individual student when assisting them,\nand not to the side. It would be most effective if students were standing and\n“finding their horizon.”  Music stands should be elevated to the proper height, and\na mirror should be properly positioned on each stand.  You will learn to maneuver\naround each student’s equipment, etc.  At this point, all cases should be directly\nunder or to the side of their chairs.\n•  As you are working with each student, your goal is to assist each student in\nmaking a quality sound on or in the vicinity of the correct pitch (fifth line F-\nsharp).  Do not get on to students who do not produce the exact pitch—especially\nif they are using brands of mouthpieces and ligatures that may be inferior and/or\nnot on your recommended list.  When listening to each student, listen for:\no  quality of sound\no  consistency of sound\no  pitch\n•  Unless the clarinet is your primary instrument, you should not be modeling\nsounds on the set-up.  As you assist each student, you will eventually find a “star\nstudent” who will become the model for future reference.  Be sure to periodically\nuse a keyboard or a metronome—with pitches—so as not to “lose sight” of the\ncorrect pitch (regardless of whether or not a model is used).\n•  Be aware of fragile and/or teary-eyed students. Move on to the next student in the\ninterest of time, but make an effort to return to these students by the end of class.\nDo not let a student leave class feeling unsuccessful.  If possible, offer a pass for\nstruggling students to come in at lunch or before/after school.\n•  The set-up always goes to the student; not the student to the set-up.\n•  Before bringing the set-up to the student, check for:\nligatures that have been placed correctly\nligature screws that are too tight\no\no  proper mouthpiece angles\no  proper alignment of the reed\no  condition of reeds\n•  Train students not to move their faces or body when you are placing the set-up. It\nmay take certain students multiple tries, and if they move after each attempt, they\n(and you!) basically have to start over each time.\n•  When students breathe, do not allow their corners to pull back at all.\nFurthermore, upper lips should not be coming off the plastic of the tops of the\nmouthpieces.  Students should breathe only through their corners, keeping their\nupper lips on the tops of the mouthpieces.\n•  With the set-up, students should progress through the following steps:\no  air (The sound starts and ends with air, making students aware of how\nthey can control their air.  This also helps students avoid undue tightness\nin the embouchure.)\no  air~vibration~air (The air “turns into” a vibration and returns to air.)\no  air~vibration\no  vibration (ultimate “final” sound)\n•  No articulation syllable should be used when making set-up sounds.  The ultimate\ngoal is for students to start their sounds with air.  An articulation syllable will be\nassigned after all students are making characteristic and consistent sounds on the\nset-up, as well as the fully-assembled clarinet.\n•  Students need to direct their air across their reed (to the imaginary dot) in order to\nachieve the desired sound.\n•  Make sure the students understand that “a sound” may not happen the very first\ntime. This is a trial and error process and may take multiple tries.\n•  Once the set-up has been placed correctly and students are making the sound you\nwant, they need to remember:\no  how it looks (by looking in the mirror)\no  how it feels\nAllow and instruct them to take the set-up from your hand without moving their\nbody and embouchure.  Have them try to reproduce the sound on their own.  Be\nprepared to further assist them if necessary.  When the sound is correct, students\nneed to remember how it sounds.\n•  Train students to freeze their body, face and embouchure at the end of whatever\ntype of sound is being made (whether it is air, a tone, etc.)  The student should not\nmove anything until the director calls the students to ready position.  This aspect\nof playing should transfer to any—and everything students play in the future (i.e.\nafter last notes of lines out of the book, last notes of songs, etc.)\n•  Whether students are making individual or group sounds, they need to stop when\nthey feel like they are running out of air.  It should never be thought of as a\ncontest to see who can hold their sounds the longest.  That serves absolutely no\nbenefit.\nIf a student feels dizzy or faint, allow them to bend over in their chair for a little\nwhile until they feel better.\nIf you feel or hear air escaping from the student’s embouchure, the student is most\nlikely not sealing properly.  This is usually caused by students pulling their\ncorners back.  Students need to constantly be told to bring their corners forward.\nAfter a student has been made aware that they are leaking air, the expectation\nshould be stated for the student to return to class the next day without that issue.\n•  While students are playing, it may be necessary to gently wiggle their mouthpiece\nfrom side to side, during which you will hear pitch variation.  This is simply\nmaking the student aware that their corners are not firm and/or their top teeth are\nnot on the top of the mouthpiece.  Ultimately, you should not be able to move the\nmouthpiece at all.\n•  The teacher should always forewarn a student before removing the mouthpiece\nfrom the student’s mouth.  The mouthpiece can easily scrape the teeth or create\ndiscomfort.\nIf you are too easily able to slide the mouthpiece out of a student’s mouth, their\ntop teeth are most likely not on the top of the mouthpiece like they should be.\nThis also means that students are holding the mouthpiece with their lips instead of\ntheir teeth.\n•  Extraneous noises at ends of sounds are a result of students collapsing their\nembouchures and/or postures.  Have students sing “la” or “dah”; then, apply that\nto the end of their sound.\nIt is your job, as the teacher, to diagnose any problems through this trial and error\nprocess.  As you go around the room, it may be helpful to you to take written\nnotes on students having problems.  Jot down any catchphrases, analogies or\nspecific things that you said to them that helped them in any way!\nIf you are struggling in your efforts to assist multiple students…..or are unsure\nabout what you are doing in general, then hire an outside consultant or\nexperienced private lesson teacher to come to your class and help.  As this\nprofessional goes around the room to hear your students, you need to follow\nthem……watch exactly what they are doing…..and take notes as well.  No\nmatter the scenario, reference these notes as you see fit in future classes.\nIf you have a large class, it may be necessary for “waiting” students to re-soak\ntheir reeds after ________ students have played.\n•  After _____ days, students will eventually need to be able to place their set-up\nand make a sound without your assistance.  The amount of time will vary year to\nyear, taking into consideration the size of the class, the overall quality of their\nsounds, and how many times you have assisted the students.\n•  Students playing bass clarinet need to use the mouthpiece and neck for sound\nproduction.  The neck should be held by the curve closest to the mouthpiece,\navoiding the register key mechanism.  Whether or not the instrument provided to\nthe student has a Charles Bay neck, the angle of the instrument (and the angle of\nthe mouthpiece when not yet on the instrument) must be similar as possible to the\nangle of a B-flat clarinet.\n•  Students need to constantly be reminded that characteristic and consistent\nset-up sounds are stepping stones to making sounds on the fully-assembled\nclarinet!  Students who do not practice their set-up sounds at home are not\nonly slowing the class down, but are not contributing to the daily progress\nand quality of the class.\n**Much of this information is applicable to beginner interviews."

As with the teaching of all woodwind\ninstruments, the most problematic fingers in both hands are the ring finger and the\npinky.  Most blips occur with the use of either or both of these fingers.\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 1-2 involve moving\neither the LH/RH ring finger and pinky at the same time.\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 3-4 involve moving\neither the LH/RH middle finger, ring finger, and pinky at the same time.\n•  For lines 1-4:\n•  Students should articulate every note.\n•  Students can audiate the counting while they are positioning.\n•  Students can audiate the note names while they are positioning.\n•  Students can audiate “long…short long….short long…short long,” while\n•\nthey are positioning.\nIn the event you have not yet taught dotted rhythms to your students, these\nexercises are already reinforcing a very challenging rhythm--in general--\nthat students will encounter all the way through their public school\nexperience.\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 5-6 involve moving\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 7-8 involve moving\n•  For lines 5-8:\n•  Students should slur every note.\n•  Students can perform these exercises without articulating.\n•  Using the same note names as lines 1-8, lines 9-12 are notated with the\nrhythms inverted.\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 9-10 involve moving\n•  Lines 11-12 involve moving either the LH/RH middle finger, ring finger, and\npinky at the same time.\n•  For lines 9-12:\n•  Students can audiate “short long…short long….short long…short,” while\n•  Using the same note names as lines 1-8, lines 13-16 are notated with the\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 13-14 involve moving\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 15-16 involve moving\n•  For lines 13-16:\nMISCELLANEOUS\n•  These exercises can be very effective, but must be audiated--in the various\nways previously discussed--and positioned at the same time.\n•  Playing tests can and should be given on these exercises to promote their\nregular practice.\n•  While positioning and/or performing these lines, it is imperative that students’\nfingers are hovering and staying very close to the keys.

Try to arrange it so students only buy reeds from the school.  Be sure the\nparents know that by purchasing the reeds from the school, they will receive a\n“___ percent” discount.  Make arrangements with your road man to facilitate this\nprocess.\nReed Strength\n•  Reeds generally come in half strength. Strengths that are offered vary by\nmanufacturer.\no  Strength is relative to the thickness of the reed. For example, a 2½ reed is\nthinner than a 3.\no  Larger strength reeds require more air; therefore, it is vital that beginners start\non a 2 or 2½, because they are still learning how to use their air properly. It is\nimportant to know that some reed manufacturers produce 1 and 1½ strength\nreeds!!!!! NOW….. considering the fact that professionals generally play\nbetween 3½ to 5 strength reeds, it would naturally make sense that MS/JH\nstudents not be playing on these stronger reeds!!!!!!!!\no  Reed strength is also dependent on the climate and player’s preference.\no  REFRAIN FROM PRESENTING THE “BADGE OF HONOR”\nPHILOSOPHY:\nFor example, if your students are playing on 2½ strength reeds in their\nbeginner class, they should not be told that they will advance to a 3 strength\nreed their second year…to a 3½ strength reed their third year…etc. You must\ncarefully base your decision to advance a student’s reed strength on the\nfollowing characteristics:\n1.  How students look—do their faces look natural when they are playing?\n2.  How students use their air—if they are not using air correctly, they will\nnot have success on any reed strength.\n3.  How students sound—is their sound stuffy?  Do you hear more air than\ntonal resonance in their sound?\nIf a clinician or mentor, after hearing your students, suggests a softer\nreed strength, students should be trained to accept this professional\nadvice. It is your job (as well as experienced private teachers if\napplicable) to closely monitor each individual student, as they will be\nplaying and developing at different levels. With that said, students\nshould move up a reed strength when the teachers feel it is time.\n•  It is perfectly acceptable for first/second year students to remain\non 2 or 2 ½ strength reeds for a long period of time. Second and\nthird year players may progress to 3 strength reeds as time goes by.\n•  Young band directors are encouraged to consult with an experienced\nprivate lesson teacher or band director/colleague when trying to make\ndecisions regarding appropriate times to advance reed strengths for\nstudents.\nReed Strengths Specifics Regarding Saxophone\n•  Most advanced alto saxophone players should remain on Vandoren 3s for classical\nsaxophone playing throughout the duration of their public school experience.\n•  MS/JH tenor and baritone saxophone players should begin on Vandoren 2 ½s.\n•  HS tenor saxophone players may progress to Vandoren 3s…maybe 3 ½s.\n•  HS baritone saxophone players may progress to Vandoren 3s.\nReed Qualities\n•  All reeds are hand-made. Every reed will sound different and will slightly vary in\nthickness as well as quality. The strength can be the same, but the individual cut will\nhave effects on the sound quality. Hard and soft does not refer to the actual reed\nstrength, but instead the individual cut of the reed. There are two distinct categories:\no  Hard\n(cid:1)  Thicker (more wood)\n(cid:1)  Requires more air\n(cid:1)  Requires a firmer embouchure\n(cid:1)  Can potentially allow students to bite more\n(cid:1)  Generally sounds airy/fuzzy, brittle, unclear, and is sharper in pitch\n(cid:1)  Playing with a hard reed can create tension in the face/embouchure, as\nwell as the jaw and neck.\no  Soft\n(cid:1)  Thinner (less wood)\n(cid:1)  The embouchure does not have to be as firm to produce a good sound.\n(cid:1)  Does not allow you to bite as much\n(cid:1)  The sound will be soft, honky, less resonant, unfocused, and\nsometimes spread.\n(cid:1)  Playing softly will be easier, but louder dynamics will have a bright\nsound. Louder dynamics will also be flat in pitch.\no  Try to find a medium “in between” reed that produces the best, desirable\nsound for each individual student.\nReed Life Cycle\n•  The cane is hand cut in the south of France in Var. Reeds are then individually\npackaged and shipped.\n•  Breaking in a reed (explained in Soaking, Breaking In and Adjusting Reeds\nhandout).\n•  Reeds that are rotated can last for 2-4 weeks depending on how much they are played\non.\no  The more a reed is played on, the softer it gets.\no  As reeds get older, they lose resonance.\no  If a reed is used too long in one sitting, the moisture that has been collecting\nin the pores of the reed will cause mold to build up.\n•  Reeds that are too thin and/or worn down from excessive use will become\nunacceptable in terms of quality and sound.\no  The response will be slow.\no  Vibrations will be slow.\no  The reed becomes thin and will produce an undesirable, spread sound.\no  Students will start to squeak on starts because the reed is harder to control.\no  MOLD will become visible.\no  These are all signs that a reed needs to be replaced.\nFinding a Good Reed\n•  Just because a reed is new, it does not mean that it will sound good.\n•  You can tell a good reed from a bad reed by sight.\no  Good reeds are yellow or crème colored on the heart.\no  Good reeds look “clean.”\no  Bad reeds have visible veins.\no  Bad reeds have a tip that is too transparent (this can be seen if a reed is held\nup to a light).\n•  You—as the teacher—reserve the right to tell a student that a reed can no longer be\nplayed.  Be professional and sensitive when telling a student a reed is bad and needs\nto be thrown away.  Parents should be made aware of this information before\ntheir child is officially recruited to play a single reed instrument.\n•  It is also important for parents to understand that as their child becomes more\nadvanced/experienced, their reeds can last longer…..AS LONG AS THE\nSTUDENTS ARE FOLLOWING ALL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN DURING\nCLASS!!  As this process evolves over time, reeds may not need to be purchased\nas often as they were when the students were first and second year players!\n•  You are encouraged to create a “Reed Graveyard” for students to deposit reeds that\nneed to be disposed of. This can be labeled and decorated as a motivating factor for\nstudents to want to deposit reeds… as opposed to leaving them on music stands, the\nfloor, or in their cases. (cid:2)\n•  To monitor quality of reeds, be sure to hear students play individually EVERY\nDAY…. regardless of their experience and/or playing ability.\nReed Guards and Reed Rotation\n•  Students must have reed guards with four completely broken in reeds.\n•  Students must be taught from the beginning to rotate each of their four reeds, which\nshould always be in their reed guard.\n•  Students should be trained to play on a DIFFERENT, BROKEN IN REED during\nevery class period/rehearsal or performance opportunity.  For example, a student\nshould not play on a reed more than one performance opportunity on any given day\n(exceptions—warm-ups and/or rehearsals prior to major individual or group\nauditions/performances).\n•  Reeds with chips, mold, etc., should never be played on—or even kept—in the reed\nguard. In addition, reeds that are too thin—or do not sound good for whatever\nreason—should never be kept in the reed guard.\n•  Reed guard checks should be daily in beginning classes at first. Daily grades should\nbe given when having a reed guard check. Each of the four reeds should be 25%.\n•  Reed guard checks can be periodic in MS/JH and HS ensembles as often as you feel\nnecessary.  Grades can be given as motivation.\n•  Reed guards should be accessible during daily rehearsals, as well as any off campus\nrehearsal, performance, contest, festival, etc. Reed guard accessibility pertains to\nthem being outside of their cases, not inside."

    "text": "CLARINET ARTICULATION EXERCISES\n•  When starting articulation exercises, the use of mirrors is vital.\n•  Remind students that the tongue only interrupts the air – it never stops the air.\n•  Articulating with black notes as opposed to white notes, encourages students to move\ntheir tongues down quicker.\n•  Make sure from the very beginning, students sing and play in a connected/legato style.\n•  Exercises to be taught in the following order:\n1.  Have students sing on “dah” and then ultimately on the French syllable “dih.”  If\nstudents are unable to sing in a connected style, they should not progress to the next\nstep.\n2.  Have students put their hand or index finger in front of their face and feel their air.\nStudents should feel continuous air and not “puffs” of air.\n3.  Go around the room and have each student tongue air at your hand, so you can assess\ntheir ability to do it correctly.\n4.  Using a mirror, students should articulate with or without their hand/index finger,\nmaking sure that their face, chin, and throat are not moving.\n5.  When you feel students have mastered the previous exercises, allow them to articulate\n– using the syllable “dah” or “dih” – on the mouthpiece and barrel.  Students should\nput their left hands under their barrel so they can feel a continuous stream of air while\nthey are articulating.  Students who do not feel continuous air need to be verbally\nmade aware that they are not articulating correctly.\n** Students should start with their tongue on the reed to create the articulation.\nThe tongue then falls down and returns to its “at rest” position in the bottom of the\nmouth.  One taste bud of the student’s tongue should touch the flat part of the reed,\nwhere the imaginary “dot” at the tip has been all along.  The air and tongue go to\nthis same “dot.”\n6.  Allow students to articulate as fast as they can.\n7.  Allow the students to start the sound and use the \"ta-day\" syllable.\n8.  Allow the students to start the sound and articulate by snapping your finger on\ncommand.\n9.  With the metronome, begin to incorporate easy follow-the-leader rhythms with you\nsinging or modeling – and the students echoing on their mouthpiece and barrel.\nWhole rests may or may not be necessary between you and the students.  As with\nyour initial sound production exercises, students need to continue counting with their\nfingers while they are playing.  This ensures that students are thinking internal\nsubdivision.\n10. Before progressing to the fully-assembled clarinet, assign the following playing test\non the mouthpiece and barrel:\n•  Attach the mouthpiece and barrel to the clarinet and begin articulation.  Students must be\nconstantly reminded that they should be articulating in the same way as they were when\njust using the mouthpiece and barrel.\n•  Whether students are playing white notes or black notes, they must constantly be\nreminded that the tongue moves down quickly.\n•  When students can successfully sing note names on the same pitch, allow them to\narticulate multiple notes on the same pitch.\n•  When pulse and foot pat are learned, students articulate every time their foot touches the\nfloor – and then when their foot touches the floor and as it comes up.\n•  Once the student is able to read music, call the articulation \"rhythmic articulation\".\nStudents should be tonguing as the music moves across the page.\n•  Do not allow students to articulate back-to-back notes on different pitches until they are\nplaying with absolute connected style on notes of the same pitch.\n•  When the tongue is moving correctly, you must decide when it is appropriate to have\nstudents begin coordinating finger movement with articulation.\n•  When students articulate back-to-back notes on different pitches, they cannot stop their\nair as they change fingerings.\n•  Teach Mary Had a Little Lamb in four segments by singing and then playing:\n•  After all students have successfully played each segment of Mary Had a Little Lamb,\nbegin to string together the segments into the following finished product:\n•  Ultimately, students should be able to execute any or all of the following on a daily basis:\no  articulate as fast as they can\no  articulate using the \"ta-day\" syllable\no  articulate on command\no  articulate with foot pat and articulate rhythms\n•  When playing exercises out of the method book, you can return to previously-learned\nlines and add articulation.  Do not feel like all lines must be executed again during class;\nassign students to perform all lines at home with articulation."

    "text": "CLARINET EMBOUCHURE\n•  Students must be able to use air correctly before beginning to learn the\nclarinet embouchure.\n•  Use the mouthpiece and barrel for better control.\n•  The teacher should place the mouthpiece in the beginning.\n•  Some teachers prefer to place the mouthpiece against the upper teeth first; others\nprefer to place the bottom lip first, and then the upper teeth and top lip. The latter\nis preferred.\n•  The student needs to remember how it feels and sounds.\n•  Once the teacher has demonstrated how it feels and sounds, the student can hold\nthe  mouthpiece  and  barrel  in  place  and  watch  his  face  in  a  mirror  to  make  sure\nnothing  moves  or  looks  unnatural.    Then,  the  student  remembers  how  it  looks,\nfeels and sounds.\nIt is best to hold the mouthpiece with two fingers and a thumb at the very bottom\nof the barrel.  The fingers should have absolutely no contact with the mouthpiece\nor ligature.\n•\n•  The mouthpiece is held by the teeth, not the lips.\n•  The upper teeth rest on the mouthpiece material (patch).\n•  The students must get used to having a lifting sensation against their upper teeth.\nUsing  rubber  gloves  (separate  for  each  student),  show  the  student  how  much\npressure they will feel.  Do not allow the student’s head to move at all.\n•  The lower teeth feel the reed through the lower lip that covers them.\n•  The lower lip covers the lower teeth like a fitted sheet covers a mattress.\n•  The back teeth are naturally apart.\n•  The tongue is in the “li” position…..slightly up, but not pulled back.\n•  Using the index finger, gently push the lower lip toward, but not rolled\nover the lower teeth.  Lick the part that goes over.  That is the correct amount.\n•  The bottom teeth should not respond to the placement of the mouthpiece by\nmoving backwards, and may move slightly forward to create a smooth area\nin the chin called the valley.  The student should not feel any tension in his jaw\nas the mouthpiece is placed on his bottom lip.\n•  The  corners  are  toward  the  mouthpiece.    Ultimately,  the  corners  will  be  toward\nthe mouthpiece and down.\n•  There should be no wrinkles in the lower lip, and red flesh must be seen\non either side of the mouthpiece.\n•  The lower lip that is not under the reed stays in front of the teeth.\n•  Never tell students to pull their lips over their teeth.  Pulling and stretching makes\nlips thicker.\n•  The upper lip rests on top of the mouthpiece in front of the upper teeth.\n•  The upper lip should be soft and pliable, and follow the shape/contour of the\nmouthpiece.\n•  Both the top and bottom lip should always feel soft and natural.\n•  There should be no lines or dimples that do not appear in the natural face.  The\nface essentially should be “zombie”-like.\n•  The air is directed at the clarinet, not into it.\n•  The air is focused to an imaginary dot in the middle of the reed where the flat\npart meets the tip.\n•  The teacher can help the student feel how the lip, the lifting and the valley feel.\n•  Enough mouthpiece must be past the lips into the chamber of the mouth to allow\nthe reed to freely vibrate.\n•  As the student focuses the air at the “dot”, an instant vibration should occur.\n•  There must be a resonant fifth line treble clef concert F# sounded.\nIf the sound is stuffy, the student may be holding the mouthpiece with the lips.\nIf the sound is strident and brittle, the student may have too much mouthpiece\nin his mouth or may be using too much unfocused air.\n•  Be sure the student can control the air well enough to find the correct balance of\nair and resistance to create the sound you want on the mouthpiece and barrel.\n•  Remember that the mouth can be too open; the teeth can be out of position; the\nlips can be too loose and puffy or can grip; the tongue can be too far back in the\nmouth; the student can be lifting too little.  All of these will result in a sound you\nwill not wish to create.\n•  Keep making subtle adjustments to the angle, amount of mouthpiece taken, etc.\nJust a slight movement can really improve the resonance of the vibration.\n•  Keep the body and face calm and still while learning this embouchure.\n•  The embouchure is a constant work in progress.  Special attention should be given\nto the contact of the upper teeth with the mouthpiece material.  The teacher can\nattempt to move the mouthpiece out of position to make the student aware that\nsomething is incorrect.\nIt is easier to make something firmer than to get rid of unnecessary tightness.\nIf the sound is not clear, instant and resonant on the mouthpiece, the sound on\nthe clarinet will not be resonant and beautiful.\n•  When  the  barrel  is  placed  on  the  clarinet,  the  first  attempt  at  sound  production\nshould be made with the teacher holding the instrument for the student.  This will\nbe demonstrated.\n•  Trade back and forth with the teacher holding: the student holding: etc."

    "text": "CLARINET THROAT TONES\nOn the clarinet, G, G#, A, and Bb in the staff are generally considered the open throat\ntones for the instrument. This means that when playing these notes, you are plugging very\nfew (if any) holes, and are usually only opening more. The air in the clarinet is going to\ntravel less and with barely any resonance in the clarinet. These notes will typically be\nsharp…..especially when sustained with other instruments sustaining the same pitch.\nPlaying throat tones with the characteristic sound and pitch takes years of practice and\nmuscle training.\n•  Have the students use very fast air on their open G. They need to try to relax their\nthroat so it is nice and open while not losing the embouchure.  When this is\nachieved, then they can apply this skill to the other three notes.\n•  It is important that students’ oral cavity is very “tall.”\n•  The teeth need to be apart in the back of the mouth.\n•  Students should think of having an egg on the back of their tongue….and if they\nclose off too much, the egg will break.\n•  Very fast air is required.\nAlternate Fingerings (not to be taught in 6th grade…but these fingerings will\nassist in improving the intonation)\n•  If sharp, add finger 6 and right pinky 1 in the right hand\n•  If still sharp, add finger 5 in the right hand\n•  If still sharp, add finger 4 in the right hand\n•  If still sharp, add finger 3 in the left hand\n•  If still sharp, add finger 2 in the left hand"

The de-humidifier is detrimental\nto the lifespan and quality of the reed (due\nto the environment).  The de-humidifier can\ncause the reeds to dry out very quickly and\nbecome warped, or cause the moisture to\nlinger and grow mold.\n•  Each reed slot is already numbered with\ndots.\n•  Tips of the reeds face toward the bottom of\nthe reed case to prevent students from\ndamaging the tips of the reeds.\nHolds 8 – MSRP $30.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  Does not include a de-humidifier\n•  Tips of the reeds face toward the hinges to\nprevent students from touching the tips of\nthe reeds.\nRico Reed Guard\nMSRP $6.75 @ wwbw.com\n•  Rico is another type of reed guard that is\nless expensive than Vandoren.\n•  Recommended for marching band use\n•  Will need to be numbered with a silver\nsharpie, paint-pen, or stickers\nVandoren Mouthpiece Patches\nPackage of 6: MSRP $8.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  Patches are flat, clear, and inexpensive\n•  Preferred over the Runyon rubber patches,\nwhich are spongy and add height to the\nmouthpiece\nIdeal for students who have braces or are\ngetting braces\n•  Keeps teeth from slipping off the\nmouthpiece and does not dampen the\nvibration as much as the Runyon patches\n•  Over time, teeth marks will appear making\nthe student more aware of how much\nmouthpiece to use.\n•  Recommended for use in marching band\nRunyon Clarinet Thumb Saver\nMSRP $1.95 @ wwbw.com\n•  Prevents blisters or calluses from forming\non the right thumb\n•  Other inexpensive options would be\npurchasing surgical tube from a home\nimprovement store or pencil grips from an\noffice supply store.\nYamaha Plastic Mouthpiece Cap\nMSRP $4.39 @ wwbw.com\n•  Plastic is absolutely preferred to metal to\nprotect the tip of the mouthpiece and reed.\n•  Make sure that students playing on an “attic\nhorn” have a mouthpiece cap.\nOne of the following can be chosen when assisting students with proper maintenance regarding corks.\nSelmer Tuning Slide and Cork Grease\nMSRP $4.60 @ wwbw.com\n•  The Selmer cork grease is a liquid and lasts\nmuch longer than the normal ChapStick-\nstyle grease.\n•  Caution should be used when using this\nbecause it is very sticky.\n•  Must be stored in a plastic Ziploc bag as it\nmay explode.\nIf it hits something in the case or if exposed\nto heat, it will damage other maintenance kit\nitems.\n•  To apply, squeeze a tiny bit of the grease up\nand down onto the cork. Then, making a\nring with the thumb and forefinger, work\nthe cork grease into the cork to create\nenough friction to properly lubricate the\ncork.\nWoodwind Cork Grease\nMSRP $2.25 @ wwbw.com\nmay explode or melt.\n•  Do not leave out at home unattended, as\nyounger children may actually use it as\nChapStick.\nGEM Swabs Silk Clarinet Swab\nMSRP $8.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  Do not use a cloth swab or a “shove-it”\n(currently called “Pad Guard”), which are\noften found with “attic horns.” Neither of\nthese items will take sufficient moisture out\nof the body of the instrument. They also\ntend to get stuck.\n•  Very absorbent and features a tapered cut to\nlimit the chance of getting stuck in the\ninstrument\n•  The mouthpiece and barrel should be\nremoved from the clarinet before swabbing.\n•  The clarinet must be held upside-down so\nthe swab can be dropped through the bell\nand through the bottom of the upper joint\nwith slight tugs. When holding the clarinet,\none hand must be at the bottom of the upper\njoint. Do not yank or pull the swab from\nside-to-side, but rather up and down.\nPulling the swab too forcefully or quickly\nmay result in the swab getting stuck or torn\nby the register flu inside the upper joint of\nthe clarinet.\n•  Wrap the swab around an index finger to\nclean the receivers of the barrel and\nmouthpiece, as well as the tip of the\nmouthpiece.\n•  Hand wash the swab with dish soap or\nWoolite and warm water.\n8x10 Plexiglass\nBinswangerglass.com\n•  Prices vary depending on where mirrors are\npurchased.\n•  Mirrors purchased through Binswanger can\nbe purchased in bulk and cut to a desired\nsize. They will also be made of plexiglass.\n•  Purchasing mirrors at a home improvement\nstore is also an option; however, mirrors\nwill have to be individually cut by a band\nparent or yourself.\n•  No matter where mirrors are purchased,   it\nis vital that they are made of plexiglass and\nnot glass. Students will not hurt themselves\non the corners of the mirrors; nor will the\nmirrors shatter when dropped.\n•  To receive a better price, attempt to find\nother band directors who would be willing\nto place an order as well. Assuring the\ncompany that you will place annual orders\nmay also result in a discount.\n•  Self-portrait mirrors from art supply stores\nare acceptable.\n•  Car clip-on mirrors are not recommended\nbecause they are too small and the hinges\nbreak easily.\n•  Makeup mirrors are not recommended\nbecause they are too small and oddly\nshaped.\nIt would be best if there was a box for the\nmirrors in each separate class location.\nStudents can then easily obtain a mirror out\nof the box before class and return the mirror\nafter class."

    "text": "BASS CLARINET NECKS AND\nEFFECTS ON POSTURE\nNecks\n•  There are two basic types of bass clarinet necks-- “Bay” necks and “Goose” necks.\n“Bay” refers to Charles Bay, who owns a company that produces various clarinet and\nsaxophone accessories.\n•  Bay necks are generally found on Buffet Prestige bass clarinets.\n•  Goose necks are generally found on Selmer bass clarinets, as well as most other\nbrands that are manufactured.\n“Bay” style neck\n“Goose” style neck\n•  Notice the difference in the curvature on the bottom left side of the neck. The Bay\nstyle neck is curved up considerably more; this angles the mouthpiece higher as well.\n•  When setting the instrument with the student, the Bay style neck makes it much easier\nfor the student to achieve the mouthpiece angle, which should be very similar to a B-\nflat soprano clarinet.\nInstrument angle and posture\n•  The instrument angle for students using a Bay style neck is different from that of a\ngoose neck.\nInstrument angle with Bay style neck\nInstrument angle with goose neck\nMouthpiece angle with Bay style neck\nMouthpiece angle with goose neck\n•  The student should sit on the edge of their chair with their feet firmly planted on the\nground shoulder width apart.  As with the teaching of all wind instruments, the\nstudent’s feet should be under their knees.\n•  The bass clarinet should be between their legs. Do not let students play the bass\nclarinet on either side of their legs. This will cause severe hand position\nproblems. Female students might be discouraged from wearing skirts if it is a\nhindrance.\nInstrument angle with a Bay style neck\n•  The student should keep the instrument close to vertical. The instrument can be tilted\nin toward the body for hand position purposes, if necessary.\n•  The student should have the peg or bell sit between their heels or slightly behind the\nheels.\nInstrument angle with a goose neck\n•  The student should tilt the bass clarinet toward their body so that the peg or bell sits\nunder the front chair legs.\n•  Keep an eye on the student’s mouthpiece. It should have an upward angle of\n•\napproximately 20 to 30 degrees.\nIt is okay for the student to learn forward with their whole upper body bent at the\nhips. Do not let the student bend the upper part of their back in a slouched position to\nreach the mouthpiece.\n•  To prevent incorrect right hand position, a neck strap is sometimes recommended.\nWithout a neck strap, the student will tend to rest the crook of their right hand\nunderneath the two bottom side keys or on the rods to hold up the instrument; this is\nincorrect."

    "text": "CLARINET CASES, IDENTIFICATION OF\nPARTS AND REMOVING IT FROM ITS CASE\nGeneral Information About All Woodwind Instrument Cases\n•  Most cases have distinguishing marks somewhere on the case.\nIdentify these marks, and their relationship to the top and bottom of\nthe case. Most cases have the handles placed on the bottom section\nof each case. Check to make sure.\n•  Place all clarinet cases on the floor in front of the student.\n•  Be sure the student understands where each part of the instrument belongs in\nthe case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make\nsure the student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure\nthe parts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse order they\nwere removed.\n•  All instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure\nexplicitly every time.\n•  Never leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up,\nbut this is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.\nCheck each opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to\nyour students.\n•  Cases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom\n“set-up” for each student’s case.  If using an ensemble room for the class, the\ncases may be opened in the hall.  The empty case will remain closed and\nlatched in the hall during class.\n•  When instruments are in their cases, do not allow students to sit on their cases\nAT ANY TIME because the keys will get bent.\nIdentifying Parts of the Clarinet and Removing It Safely From Its Case\n•  Once the case information is understood, place the case on the floor.  Never let\nthe student place the case in his lap.\n•  Open the case from its correct position.  Remember, most latches will lift up.\n•\nIdentify the lower joint:  this joint has a thumb rest on the bottom side and three\nsilver rings on the upper. When replaced correctly in the case, the thumb rest\nshould never be seen.\nIdentify the upper joint:  the register key is on the bottom, but call it the “long,\nskinny” key or the “exclamation point” key. Students will remember this\ndescription more easily in the beginning.  It also has only two silver rings on\nthe top.\n•  When new instruments are delivered during the summer, be sure to remove the\nparts carefully from the plastic wrapping, and remove the corks (which are used\nto help pads keep their shape during shipping) between the rods.\n•  Corks on a new beginner instrument are usually really fat mainly due to heat\nexposure during the delivery process.  The parts will not easily fit together.\nOnly someone with experience should carefully sand the corks to the proper\nsize.  Using very fine sand paper (400), take off a very small amount and wrap\nit around and turn from side to side, being careful not to scrape too much as it\ncould damage the wood or mouthpiece. After this process, test it many times\nuntil you have the correct fit that can easily be controlled by a small child.\n•  For both new and used beginner instruments, it may be necessary to apply cork\ngrease lightly to the corks after instruments are delivered during the summer.\nMaking a ring with your thumb and forefinger, work the cork grease into each\ncork to create enough friction to properly lubricate the corks. Students will\neventually need to be taught to apply cork grease as well. Even if the student\nunderstands how little is needed, you still must watch them apply the cork\ngrease several times before you trust them to do the job alone.  Never let the\nstudent have his own tube of cork grease in the beginning of the learning\nprocess.  After he has proven his competence, he may have the tube.  If any\ngiven cork looks dull, and the tenon is difficult to fit with the receiver, a small\namount of cork grease may be needed. Teach him to ask you first before\napplying. Once you know he has made the correct analysis, the student may\nmake his own decisions. Cork grease tubes or liquid grease can explode or melt\ninside the case if the respective lids are not completely closed. It is possible that\ndamage to the key mechanism will result if cork grease comes in contact with\nthe wood, metal or even other maintenance kit items.\n•  The barrel of the clarinet will look like a barrel, and will have a large end and a\nsmall end. The large end is placed on the upper joint, and the mouthpiece (to be\nidentified later) is placed into the small end.\n•  The bell looks like a bell and is placed on the lower joint.\n•  The mouthpiece has a thin end and a fat end.  The top is curved, and the bottom\n(table) is flat.  The importance of these features will be explained later.\n•  The ligature is usually metal for the beginning instrument, having both a large\nend and a small end. The screws for the ligature will always appear on the right\nside of the mouthpiece as the student looks at the mouthpiece from the flat side.\nScrews for ligatures will never appear on the left side of the mouthpiece.\n•  The reed is basically the same shape as the mouthpiece.  It has a thin end and a\nfat end…..a flat side and a curved side.\n•  The reed/mouthpiece cap (protector) should be made of plastic (and sometimes\nmetal with attic horns) for the beginning instrument.  If metal protectors are\nused, be aware that they will most likely scratch the mouthpiece and perhaps\ndamage the tip of the reed.  Using a plastic protector will result in fewer broken\nreeds.  Students should always keep their mouthpiece in a mouthpiece cap\nwhen the instrument is not being played (including moving from a warm-up\nroom to a concert stage). A single chip in a mouthpiece can render it useless,\ncausing students to have to purchase a new one.\n•  The table (flat part) of the mouthpiece may not necessarily be exactly flat;\nsometimes they warp over time and with usage.  To fix this, use the finest\nsandpaper (400).  Place the sandpaper on a piece of glass.  Rub the table of the\nmouthpiece on the combined surface of sandpaper and glass.  Check often to\nsee if the mouthpiece does not “rock” when placed against the plate glass.  The\ntip of the mouthpiece can also be carefully rubbed on the combined surface of\nsandpaper and glass.\n•  Periodically have mouthpiece checks.  Check for chips on rails and on the tip.\nAlso check for chips on the inside of the tip.  Give written work to your\nstudents while you check each mouthpiece carefully.  A chipped mouthpiece\ncan be devastating to a beginning clarinet student’s embouchure development.\n•  No music, folders, flipfolders, rolled up music or unnecessary objects may be\nplaced in the case on top of the instrument at any time…..unless they can fit\ninside the nook meant for these items.\n•  Students should not be allowed to keep anything in the bell (i.e. reeds,\nmouthpieces, cork grease, etc.).  Pertaining specifically to bass clarinet, some\nof these items could actually get stuck in the bell/instrument.\n•  Look at the case in relation to the parts of the clarinet. Most cases are molded\nto the shape of the particular parts.  Be specific when making this point to your\nstudents.  Take your time, and repeat the information many times. When parts\nare placed correctly in the case, all silver rings are pointing toward the ceiling.\nDamage will occur if the parts are placed incorrectly in the case.\nStorage of Mouthpiece and Barrel (when allowed to be taken home by the students\nbut not in the actual clarinet case)\n•  Provide students a Ziploc bag…..or have students bring a sock or padded bag\nwith some sort of identifying feature\n•  Ziploc bags/socks should be kept in a box in the front of the classroom, or\nstored safely in an office or filing cabinet.\n•  Bags/socks should only be taken out of the classroom by students after school.\n•  Bags/socks should only be brought into the classroom prior to the start of\nschool.\n•  Contents of bags/socks should never be kept in backpacks, bookbags, pencil\npouches, etc.\n•  Have some sort of accountability system in place when students leave their\nbags/socks overnight.  (cid:1)\n•  Be on the lookout for students coming into your classroom with bags/socks\n(and later clarinet cases) which were kept in their lockers or gym lockers.

    "text": "CLARINET ASSEMBLY AND\nINSTRUMENT/BODY RATIO\n•  As you begin to teach the clarinet, give only the “set-up” (mouthpiece, barrel and\nligature), as well as all related maintenance kit items (reeds, reed guard, mouthpiece\ncap, swab and cork grease), to the students in a plastic bag with the student’s name on\nit.  The other parts (upper joint, lower joint, and bell) will remain in the case until\nfurther instruction is given.\n•  Students should be told that after sound production has been taught on the “set-up,”\nthey will be allowed to take home the body of the clarinet as well. To sell this concept\nto the parents, explain the money factor.  It is almost as expensive to replace one\nbroken item as it is to buy an entire instrument.\nAssembly of the mouthpiece and barrel “set-up”\n1.  Open the case, which should be on the floor in front of the student.\n2.  Put the reed in the mouth to moisten and smooth the top and bottom of it.\nMoistening the bottom of a reed helps create a seal, which will result in\nbetter response.\n3.  Pick up the barrel with the right hand, and the mouthpiece (without the\nligature) with the left hand. Never grab the tip of the mouthpiece; always\ngrasp around the middle.\n4.  When assembling the mouthpiece and barrel, students should use slight\ntwisting motions. No cork should be showing.\n5.  Place the large end of the ligature over the mouthpiece carefully.  Make\nsure the screws are on the right (some “stock” ligatures have screws on the\nfront of the mouthpiece) as you look at them from the table of the\nmouthpiece.  Bonade ligatures have two screws……BG ligatures have one\nscrew.  If using Rovner ligatures, the leather is in the front and there is one\nscrew in the back.\n6.  Lift the ligature slightly with the thumb and forefinger of a chosen hand,\nand carefully slide the reed onto the table of the mouthpiece.  The reed is\nplaced fat to fat, flat to flat and thin to thin.\n7.  The edges of the reed should be aligned along the rails/sides of the table of\nthe mouthpiece.\n8.  Look for a thin black line/sliver at the tip of the mouthpiece.\n9.  The ligature should cover at least one of the two lower lines that appear on\nmost quality mouthpieces, and definitely below the upper line on most\nquality mouthpieces.\n10. For ligatures with two screws:  tighten the lower screw snuggly, and the\ntop screw to its first point of resistance.  For ligatures with one screw:\ntighten the screw to its first point of resistance.  Generally speaking,\nligatures that are placed too low result in control issues; ligatures that are\nplaced too high prohibit reed vibration.\n11. Put the mouthpiece cap on the mouthpiece and barrel set-up.\n12. Lay down the set-up gently in the case.\nAssembly of the body of the clarinet (assuming that the assembly of the mouthpiece\nand barrel set-up is already completed and is kept in a safe place)\n1.  Pick up the upper joint.  Use the right hand, and lay it in your left hand.\nThe palm of the left hand is toward the ceiling.  The long skinny key goes\naway from the body and toward the floor.\n2.  Pick up the lower joint with the right hand between the pancake keys.  The\npalm of the right hand should be toward the floor and the thumb rest\nshould also point to the floor.  Lock the thumb and forefinger of the right\nhand around the joint.\n3.  Place the middle finger of the left hand over the covered key between the\nsilver rings and press down.  This will lift the bridge key.\n4.  The student cannot place two tenons or two receivers together.  The tenon\non the bottom of the upper joint fits into the receiver of the lower joint.\nPlace the tenon into the receiver in a horizontal position.  Any angle could\nresult in damage to the tenon.  Twist and push in opposite directions. No\ncork should be showing. Assist students who are not strong enough to\naccomplish this task.\n5.  Check to see if the keys are in line and facing the student.  Run the index\nfinger of the left hand down the silver rings to make sure they line up.\n6.  Slide the left hand down between the pancake keys on the lower joint.\n7.  Holding the connected upper and lower joint with the left hand, pick up\nthe bell with the right hand.\n8.  Place the bell on the right knee.\n9.  Place the bell and lower joint together; twist and push. No cork should be\nshowing.\n10. Holding the assembled body of the clarinet with the left hand, slide the\nhand to the top of the upper joint.  Using the right hand, twist and push the\nassembled mouthpiece and barrel to the clarinet.  Make sure the table of\nthe mouthpiece is in line with the long skinny key.\nInstrument Disassembly and Swabbing\n1.  Holding the assembled body of the clarinet with the left hand, slide the\nhand to the top of the upper joint.  Using the right hand, twist and pull the\nassembled mouthpiece and barrel off of the clarinet.\n2.  Put the mouthpiece cap on the mouthpiece and barrel set-up.\n3.  Lay down the set-up gently in the case and grab the silk swab.\n4.  The clarinet must be held upside-down so the swab can be dropped\nthrough the bell and through the bottom of the upper joint with slight tugs.\nWhen holding the clarinet, one hand must be at the bottom of the upper\njoint. Do not yank or pull the swab from side-to-side, but rather up and\ndown. Pulling the swab too forcefully or quickly may result in the swab\ngetting stuck or torn by the register flu inside the upper joint of the\nclarinet.\n5.  After swabbing the body, slide the left hand down to the pancake keys.\nWith the right hand, remove the bell with a twisting motion and place it in\nthe case correctly.\n6.   Slide the left hand to the top of the upper joint. Place the middle finger of\nthe left hand over the covered key between the silver rings and press\ndown. This will lift the bridge key.\n7.  Place the right hand over the pancake keys. Take apart the upper and\nlower joint horizontally with a twisting motion.\n8.  Place the lower joint back in the case. Make sure the thumb rest is down\nso that it cannot be seen. The silver rings should be pointing straight up.\n9.  Place the upper joint in the case to that the rings are facing up and the\nregister key (exclamation mark key) is facing down. Be careful not to\nbend the side/trill keys when putting the upper joint back in the case.\n10. Pick up the set-up with the left hand and take off the mouthpiece cap.\n11. Loosen the ligature screw(s). Do not let the students loosen the screw(s) so\nmuch that the screws fall out!\n12. Remove the reed by lifting the ligature with the thumb and forefinger,\nbeing careful not to have any contact with the tip of the reed.  “Vacuum”\nthe reed through the lips……blot the reed on the pants/shorts if\nnecessary……and put in the reed guard.\n13. Remove the ligature from the mouthpiece and place it on the stand. Take\napart the mouthpiece and barrel with a twisting motion. Make sure\nstudents do not grab the tip of the mouthpiece!!!\n14. Pick up the swab and wrap the swab around an index finger to clean the\nreceivers of the barrel and mouthpiece, as well as the tip of the\nmouthpiece. Now the barrel can be placed in the case.\n15. Place a dry or broken reed back on the mouthpiece without tightening the\nscrews. The ligature must be put on so that the screws are facing the same\ndirection when put on earlier. Consider using an old or unused DRY reed\nto be placed on the mouthpiece at the end of each playing session, whether\nit is at school or at home.  Always leave the ligature on the mouthpiece\nwith this “dry reed,” which is replacing the “class reed.”  This will prevent\ndamage and allow the ligature to form and bond more correctly with the\nmouthpiece.  A “USED/WET” REED WILL RESULT IN MOLD OR\nMILDEW FORMING ON THE REED, IN THE MOUTHPIECE\nAND THE CASE.\n16. Put the mouthpiece cap on the mouthpiece after the reed and ligature are\nsecured. Place the mouthpiece in the case with the screws of the ligature\nfacing upwards.\n•  Students should be given CLASS TIME to clean out their instrument, and store their\nreed and instrument properly in the case.\n•  When the clarinets have to be set down on the chair or floor for any reason (leaving\nclass, breathing exercises where students are standing, etc.), it is important that the\nthumb rest is facing down.  This is to prevent the keys from being damaged.\n•  When students must set down their instrument during a class, the mouthpiece (or\nmouthpiece and barrel) needs to be removed and placed on the chair (mouthpiece cap\nshould be placed on the mouthpiece); the body of the instrument can then be placed\nunderneath the chair in the above-stated manner.\n•  SEND SEGMENTS OF THIS INFORMATION HOME TO PARENTS.\nCHOOSE THE INFORMATION YOU THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR\nHOME PRACTICE AND INSTRUMENT CARE.\nInstrument/Body Ratio\n•  Familiarize the student with the instrument/body ratio by using only the upper and\nlower joints.\n•  The left hand should gently hold the upper joint in the same manner used to assemble\nthe instrument--without putting pressure on the long keys.\n•  The right hand should hold the lower joint in the same manner used to assemble the\ninstrument--without putting pressure on the long keys.\n•  Move the instrument up and down, side to side by using the elbows.  All aspects of\nthe brass instrument information hold true here.  The body playing position also holds\ntrue from previous information.  We are merely getting used to the weight of the\ninstrument; the position of the instrument; and the angle of the instrument without\nusing correct hand position.  The student should not squeeze the instrument as these\nexercises are practiced.  Keep the palms of the hands soft.\n•  Familiarize the student in this manner for a few days before placing the fingers in\ntheir correct position."

    "text": "INSTRUMENTS IN THE TROMBONE FAMILY\nSoprano Trombone (also known as the “slide trumpet”)\nPitched in B-flat; reads concert pitch (non-transposing)\nSounds an octave above the tenor trombone\nUses a trumpet mouthpiece, and generally played as an extension of trumpet playing\nNot to be used by MS/JH or HS bands, as it is a novelty instrument, mainly for use in trombone choirs and jazz ensembles.\nAlto Trombone\nPitched in E-flat; reads concert pitch (non-transposing)\nSounds a perfect fourth higher than the tenor trombone\nUsually reads alto and tenor clefs\nTone is brighter due to its smaller bore\nAbout half the size of the tenor trombone; thus, the lengths of positions are completely different (they are smaller)\nMainly used by advanced players in symphony orchestras, and literature for the alto trombone is from the Baroque to early Romantic periods\nLiterature selections include Symphony No. 3 “Rhenish” by Schumann, Die Zauberflöte by Mozart, and Missa Solemnis by Beethoven\nPlease note: it is not wise to have a student begin to learn alto trombone until after he/she has a very firm foundation in tenor trombone playing. Many people do not begin to learn alto trombone until they are college music majors, and many of the literature played in high school orchestras can be played on the tenor trombone. We do not recommend having students playing alto trombone in the public schools.\nTenor Trombone\nMost common instrument in public schools for MS/JH and HS (with F attachment)\nABOUT ATTACHMENTS FOR TROMBONE\nTerminology\nOpen wrap attachments have tubing that extends past the main tuning slide and only has one curve in it. The open wrap attachment is preferred as there are less bends in the tubing, allowing the air flow to be less restricted.\nClosed wrap attachments (also known as “traditional” wraps) are curved with all of the tubing fitting inside the main tuning slide.\n“Straight” horns are horns that do not have attachments. These would typically be the small bore horns on which most beginners will start.\nAttachments Relating to Specific Instruments\nThe alto trombone can have an attachment (typically a B-flat rotary valve attachment) but it is not totally necessary. The attachment simply makes playing the instrument easier.\nThe F-attachment on tenor trombone allows the trombonist to reach notes not available on the small bore “straight’ horn. Most specifically, these notes are in the lower register (E-flat below the staff to C below the staff), which are typically played by the bass trombone anyway.\nBass Trombone\nThe bass trombone typically has two attachments and, thus, two triggers; these are generally F/G-flat and D/D-flat attachments.\nThese attachments allow for lower notes to be played that cannot necessarily be played with ease on the tenor trombone.\nTypes of Valves\nRotary\nStandard design on most F-attachments\nAttempts to emulate European style of trumpet playing\nThayer valve\nConically shaped\nSmoother transitions\nMore open sound\nThe bass trombone is a color instrument; it does not sound an octave lower than the trombone, but rather, there is a distinct, timbral difference between the two instruments.\nThe bass trombone has a rounder, fuller sound than the tenor trombone, and in the lower register, an amount of controlled edge can produce a variety of effects for the ensemble.\nRequires a slightly larger mouthpiece than tenor trombone.\nShould only be played by mature players in a HS ensemble. MS/JH students should not be playing the instrument because it is too challenging given the physical and mental development of students in that age group.\nContrabass Trombone\nPitched in B-flat; reads in concert pitch (non-transposing)\nNot much different from the bass trombone other than it has a double slide, which allows the instrument to play lower with more ease than the bass trombone.\nNot to be used by MS/JH or HS bands, as it is rarely used outside of a professional ensemble (much less in a professional ensemble!)\nValve Trombone\nPitched in B-flat\nIt’s shaped like a trombone but has valves where a slide should be; in other words, it is the platypus of the trombone family.\nBasically, it was developed for European polka bands and early American military bands, but the most common use today is a bass version known as the cimbasso, which is typically played by tuba players on a tuba mouthpiece in operatic works by Verdi and Puccini.\nNot to be used by MS/JH or HS bands, as it is a novelty instrument.\nTrombone Maintenance Kit – Recommended Items\nOR\nTROMBONE MOUTHPIECE INFORMATION\nFactors to consider when looking at a mouthpiece\nRim width\nCup depth\nShank size/back bore\nPlating\nBasic terminology\nBore size refers to the instrument you are playing, not the mouthpiece. The bore size is the inside diameter of the leadpipe. Small bore trombones are typically .500- inch and large bore trombones are typically .547-inch.\nSmall shank mouthpieces refer to mouthpieces that can fit on a straight trombone or small bore euphonium.\nLarge shank mouthpieces refer to mouthpieces that can fit on trombone with large bores (typically, those with secondary attachments) and euphoniums with large bores.\nMouthpiece adapters are made for people playing on small shank mouthpieces to play on a large bore instrument. Do not use mouthpiece adapters, if possible – try to play on small shank mouthpieces for small bore instruments and large shank mouthpieces for large bore instruments. This is to maintain the integrity of the proportions that the instruments were designed to sound best on.\nSilver vs. gold plating\nThere has been much controversy surrounding the issue of playing on silver-plated or gold-plated mouthpieces. These include the following:\nEndurance\nTone quality\nEase of playing\nOverall embouchure health\nSo what’s the truth? Because the embouchure is incredibly personal and can only be truly determined and developed on an individual level, the issue, as a whole, does not really matter. Students will discover what works best for them as they develop, and they should only do so under the supervision of a private lesson instructor.\nAs far as beginners are concerned, start them on a silver mouthpiece. It is cheaper, and since you do not know what kind of embouchure issues they may have on the onset, there is no need to have them start on a gold mouthpiece, which is up to double the cost.\nBRANDS/MODELS FOR TROMOBNE\nBeginner Trombones\nYamaha YSL-354                    $1,197.00\nBach TB300                             $540.00\nConn 23H                                 $1, 035.00\nKing 606 USA Series               $799.00\nConsidering that most students move up to a professional instrument within a year or two, it is probably best to rent a beginner trombone instead of buying the instrument.

Before purchasing any custom instruments, you should consult a professional and/or your private lesson instructor.\n**Specific pricing for Edwards instruments changes often, therefore the most accurate pricing is only available through contacting the company.\nTROMBONE ASSEMBLY, HAND POSITION AND INSTRUMENT/BODY RATIO\nAssembly\nPlace the case on the floor. Most latches on trombone cases face up.\nOpen the case, and make sure that both parts of the horn – as well as the mouthpiece compartment – are secure.\nBefore removing the slide from the case, make sure the slide lock is on.\nUnlatch and remove the slide from the case with the right hand. The palm will face down on the slide bars.\nTip the slide immediately towards the floor, making the slide parallel with the body and with the large end facing inward. The endpin on the slide should touch the ground. The slide will remain stationary for the remainder of the assembly process.\nUnlatch and remove the bell form the case. The palm will face down near the bell brace. Lift with the bell down and the counterweight up so that the bell is parallel with the body.\nThe bell will move toward the slide at the docking station. Tilting slightly away from the slide, the bell will rest down on top of the slide. Do not secure the bell to the slide until the correct angle has been set.\nTo set the correct angle, have the student stand up and look down towards the trombone. Remember – the slide is not a crutch, and the student should never lean on the trombone, especially when it has not been secured.\nThe angle should be 180 degrees and should read like a clock, “fifteen minutes to three.”\nSlowly move the bell until the clock reads “three o’clock.” Then, move an additional five minutes to 3:05.\nSecure the bell and the slide at the docking station until the first point of resistance.\nHolding the trombone in the left hand, carefully remove the mouthpiece with the right hand.\nSeat the mouthpiece gently into the lead pipe, and rotate 2/3 of a turn for a friction grip.\nHand Position\nWith the left hand, form an “L” or a gun. Have the student wrap the bottom three fingers around the left brace of the slide while the thumb wraps around the brace of the bel. The index finger should lie relaxed on top of the upper slide brace.\nThe thick pads of the left hand should never overlap to the outer slide. Students will “clip” their hands when moving the slide. This is the most common beginner “injury,” and it can easily be avoided.\nThe right hand should hold the slide with fleshy part of the index and middle fingers and the thumb (“two fingers and a thumb”).\nBring the instrument to the face. Though not part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling the instrument toward the student’s face. Instruct students to keep their elbows soft while playing the trombone.\nAn “X” should form between the left and right arms and elbows should be on the same plane when holding the instrument correctly.\nAll hands will fall in from the writs. The body of the hand must never fall behind the wrist.\nThere should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the trombone.\nThe inside of the arm must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding the trombone correctly. No body part touches another body part!\nElbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be hampered.\nRemember, the left hand does not “grip” the instrument. No tension should be felt in this hand when holding the instrument.\nThe palms of both hands should feel soft. The palm of the right hand should never touch the instrument. The teacher should be able to clearly see a “circular” opening between the right hand and the slide.\nThe student should understand that slide movement is aided by the soft tissue of the palm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand.\nThe trombone is the most awkward instrument to hold out of all brass instruments, and students should be constantly reminded to keep a calm mind and a calm body. Take frequent breaks so that students can build endurance when learning how to hold the instrument to avoid bad habits from forming.\nInstrument/Body Ratio\nAssuming that the student is either standing or sitting with correct posture, instruct them to pick up the body of the trombone with both hands and simply lift it by using their elbows. Move the instrument up and down, side to side, higher than usual and lower than usual. As students are doing this, have them notice how it affects the balance of the body. Eventually, the body should feel balanced with or without the instrument in hand.\nTROMOBNE FACE/EMBOUCHURE\nEach student should use their own “safe/unbreakable” mirror – both in the classroom and at home.\nUsing the mirror, have each student notice how natural their face looks. They will have to later remember and memorize how it looks and feels.\nThe head must be balanced on the shoulders in a comfortable position – not too far forward and not too far backward.\nThe eyes should be soft and natural and the “sight line” should be exactly level. The distance between eyebrows should not change as air goes in and out of the body.\nLook for natural creases in the face, and allow any that are naturally present to exist while playing. No other creases are allowed.\nThe corners should move in toward the canine teeth. The corners should never look or feel pulled back.\nThe corners can move down from the natural position as the student progresses, but they can never move up.\nThe texture of both the upper and lower lip should be very soft and relaxed.\nThere should be natural space between the inside of the lips and the gums and teeth. This space should not change or feel different when the lips vibrate inside the cup of the mouthpiece.\nThe back teeth are slightly apart and should feel the same as when the student is reading, watching television, etc. The teeth should not be pressed into each other when doing these other activities.\nBrass instrument embouchures are formed with natural overbite. A student with an underbite should be steered away from brass instruments.\nThe thickness of a student’s lips should correspond to the size of the cup of the mouthpiece for the chosen instrument. Students with a very thin top or bottom lip should be steered towards high brass instruments rather than trombone.\nThe bottom of the front of the tongue should lie in the soft tissue area which is located in the front of the mouth just behind the ridge of the bottom gum.\nRemember that when playing the trombone, cheeks will only “puff out” if the air is not freely going into the instrument. This should be avoided!\nAssuming that the above has been achieved, the embouchure will be formed with special attention to the following:\nThe mouthpiece must be placed in the middle of the mouth – up and down as well as side to side.\nThe corners are in their natural position and should be set against the canine teeth.\nThe lips must be allowed to freely vibrate in response to the airstream rather than made to “buzz” in front of the airstream.\nThe lips must feel natural so that air can freely move past them – they must not be pulled back against the teeth or blown away from the teeth and gums.\nThe students should remember that the mouthpiece “gathers” the air – not the lips.\nThere must never be more energy placed against the upper lip than the lower lip; hence the mouthpiece (and the instrument) will angle slightly downwards.\nTROMBONE FLEXIBILITY AND RANGE EXTENSION\nBrass playing is based upon flexibility (or “lip slurs”).\nA lip slur is defined as a change in notes between partials, done with air speed, absent of articulation between notes, and without moving the slide (save for minor tendency changes). The most common lip slur for beginners, for example, would occur between fourth-line F and above-the-staff B-flat.\nStudents eventually need to be flexible through each of the harmonic series in order to move up and down within the range of the instrument.\nOnce the student can reproduce a given pitch at will, the teacher must decide whether flexibility up or down is needed first.\nFlexibility is controlled by air direction and the isometrics created by the corners and canine. The head must stay in its natural, balanced position at all times. The angle of the instrument must never change.\nStudents must learn to angle the air in the cup of the mouthpiece without changing the position of the lips and/or the relationship of the upper and lower teeth.\nFlexibility is also enhanced by vowel sounds used in various registers. These sounds can be “ah” for the middle register…”ee” for the upper register…and “oh” for the lower register. Have students practice saying these vowel sounds with vocalization on appropriate lower, middle, and higher sounds\nBring the students’ attention to the fact that the shape of the tongue changes dramatically from vowel sound to vowel sound. All students should be aware that vowel sounds are the middles of words that they speak every day. Practice saying words that use the required sounds (i.e. bow, ball, beep).\nRange is developed though flexibility. It is more important to create a resonant sound while practicing flexibility than to create wider intervals. The student can enhance their range by making more resonant sounds in the middle register before trying to extend higher or lower.\nMake sure students understand the texture of the lips have nothing to do with range. For example, students should never be told to “tighten” their lips in order to play in the higher register.\nTROMBONE ARTICULATION\nThe tongue moves in the same manner when articulating a brass instrument as it does when you speak. The tongue moves up and down – not back and forth – both when speaking and when articulating on an instrument.\nThe purpose of the tongue is to release the air which causes the lips to vibrate and create the sound. The tongue’s release of the air simply defines the beginning/start of the vibration/sound.\nArticulation is used to define the vibrations necessary to create musical rhythm, style, and movement – to contrast the use of slurring (which also creates similar musical entities).\nThe students should think that the tongue “articulates” the sound created by the airstream. If the student is taught to create the sound correctly, articulation will be an easy transition.\nSound occurs when the air moves past the naturally vibrating lips.\nArticulate the sound that is already present.\nTeach students to articulate at the moment the sound begins.\nWithout the instrument or mouthpiece, use the following procedure:\nSay the word “DOG.”\nSing the syllable “DAH.”\nOnce these are mastered, have the student use the mouthpiece and instrument to reproduce the “DAH” syllable in their brain to create an articulated sound.\nThe tongue should feel the same when saying, singing, and playing on the mouthpiece or instrument.\nThe tongue should touch where the gums meet the teeth – in the same spot with the same strength every time.\nUse the syllable “DAH” because it creates soother and more easily controlled air as opposed to the “TAH” syllable.\nAfter each “articulation,” the tongue must immediately fall down into its natural “at rest” position.\nThe tongue will be naturally soft at all times, but can articulate with different strengths.\nThe tongue will be in its “down position” 98% of the time when articulating correctly.\nHave the student start their sound with the air.\nUsing the information about the basics of articulation, have the student articulate as fast as they can with no limitations of numbers, worries about evenness of articulation, etc. Simply get them used to articulating!\nHave the student then use the “ta-day” syllable to practice using the tongue in an organized manner.\nHave the student then articulate “on command.” The student will start their sound, and articulate when you tap them on the shoulder from behind to practice gaining more control of the tongue.\nOnce the student understands pulse and the foot pat, have the student articulate exactly when the toe of the foot touches the floor.\nHave the student articulate with the down and up position of the foot\nProceed to written rhythms as they begin to read music.\nAlways practice this entire routine. The student must always go through the entire process, so he or she will not lose the ability to move his or her tongue at various speeds and in a structured manner.\nSLURRING ON THE TROMBONE\nSlurs can occur in four forms:\nLip Slur\nNo tongue\nSame position\nNatural Slur\nDifferent positions\nValve slur\nSame or different positions\nLegato slur\nLegato tongue\nThe only slur that requires a tongue-start is a legato slur. Legato slurs occur between notes that are on the same harmonic/partial. Notes on the same partial can cause a “glissando” and the legato slur is used to prevent that “smear” effect.\nLegato slurs require:\nA soft legato syllable, “dah” or “doo,” that brushes very lightly (think ‘3 taste buds’)\nThe tongue brushes on the ridge above the teeth; the legato tongue does not touch enamel.\nThe tongue must move away quickly to prevent compression of the air.\nThe tongue must be synchronized with an efficient slide movement.\nIf you can get your beginners to slur correctly from the onset, they will be ahead of the game in middle school. Apart from correct slide positions, slurring on trombone is perhaps the most neglected aspect of playing by young teachers! Set your students up for success by instilling proper habits from the beginning!\nTROMOBNE SLIDE MAINTENANCE\nProper care of the trombone slide is crucial for the well-being of the instrument. A poorly maintained trombone can start deteriorating in quality in as little as 5 years.\nIt is suggested that the slide be cleaned at least every 7-10 days. If the trombone is going to be “put away” for an extended amount of time, it needs to be cleaned beforehand to minimize the moisture trapped inside the instrument while not in use.\nMaterials needed:\nCleaning rod\nCheesecloth\nGlass cleaner or mild soap and water\nTrombotine, Yamaha Slide Lubricant, or Slide-O-Mix\nSpray bottle filled with water\nInsert at least a yard-length of cheese cloth through the eye of your cleaning rod. Wrap a small amount of cheesecloth around the tip of the cleaning rod to avoid damage if it hits the crook of the slide. Wrap the remainder of the cheesecloth around the length of the cleaning rod. You should have enough cheesecloth to hold onto as it inserts the slide so it does not get “lost” in the slide and become difficult to remove.\nInsert the cleaning rod and cheesecloth into the outer slide. Be careful not to hit the crook of the slide as it is entering. Move the cleaning rod in and out of the outer slide, creating friction as you do so. The friction breaks up the chemical bonds that hold the left-over slide lubricant in the slide.\nRepeat in the opposite end of the slide.\nThe same process should be used for the inner slide, but extreme care should be taken as the inner slide is the most fragile part of the entire instrument.\nAfter you are finished with the cleaning rod, the cheesecloth should be disposed of.\nTake glass cleaner (or a mild soapy water solution) and gently clean the exterior of the inner slide. This will remove any residue left from previous applications of slide lubricant. Please note that the inner slide is plated nickel, not silver, therefore silver polish should not be used to clean it.\nOnce the inner slide is clean, apply the slide lubricant\nYamaha Trombone Slide Lubricant\nApply evenly over both prongs of the inner slide.\nSpray with water.\nNo “working in” is necessary.\nSlide-O-Mix\nApply a drop from the small flask at the stockings (wide end) of the inner slide. Distribute evenly by putting on the outer slide and moving it up and down several times.\nApply liquid from the larger bottle at the top of the inner slide and let it trickle down the length of the slide. Once again, use the outer slide to help evenly distribute the lubricant.\nTrombotine (standard in most classrooms)\nApply a pea-sized amount of lubricant to the stocking (wide end) of the slide.\nBegin by working the lubricant into the stocking of the slide, and work your way up to the rest of the slide (since the stocking is the wider part, it will have the most contact with the outer slide, so it is crucial that it is well-lubricated).\nThe Trombotine should form a thin (nearly invisible) layer over the inner slide.\nRepeat on the second prong of the inner slide.\nTrombotine can often act like a reed in the fact that it works in “cycles.” It can take 2-3 days to “break in” and feel most effective. Once you have reached this point, it will be at its best for about 7 days, then you will feel it deteriorate for 2-3 days, by which time the slide needs to be cleaned and re-lubricated."

    "text": "MAKING THE FIRST SAXOPHONE MOUTHPIECE\nAND NECK SOUND\nInitial sound production cannot be introduced until correct posture and breathing\nhas been successfully taught.  Include these two essential components as “part” of\nthe first sound attempt(s).\nRelax position and ready position should already be taught and drilled prior to\nsound production.  As sound production is occurring, playing position must be\nincorporated.  Students need to understand that ready position means they are\nready to play.  Playing position means that they are set (physically) to play.\nStudents should not be allowed to sit in relax position during class, except maybe\nduring announcements, paperwork or things not pertaining to playing.  If one\nword instructions are preferred, then use “ready” and “set.”\nTry to get every student to make a sound on the first day of sound production.  If\nyou will not be able to accomplish this, make a disclaimer before you start.  The\nstudents who do not end up getting to make their first sound—on the first day—\nwill be the first students you will start with on the second day!  Students should\nnot be surprised or frustrated if you do not get to them on this first day.\nOn day one of sound production, make another disclaimer if you suspect that you\nwill not get far enough along to allow any of the students to take home their “set-\nup”.\nAt the end of each class, you must make the decision to allow just those who you\nassisted to take home their set-up…….or not allow set-ups to go home until\neveryone has made sounds with your assistance (day one, day two, etc.).\nOnce you allow and require set-ups to go home on a daily basis, students should\nbe recording their practice time on whatever form of practice card you are using.\nBe realistic when designating ____ minutes to be spent on their set-up sounds\nduring their home practice.\nIt is not necessary to have students make sounds on just the mouthpiece (without\nthe neck).  It will be much easier for you……and eventually less awkward for the\nstudents…….to hold the mouthpiece and neck.  If you choose to start on just the\nmouthpiece, then you are encouraged to add the neck very soon.\nDo not use a metronome when assisting students to make their first sounds.  A\nmetronome should not be added until the class is at the point of making group\nsounds.\nRemind students that lipstick, Chapstick, etc. cannot be worn during class.\nStudents need to understand that their reeds will not last long, and they will begin\nto see mold.  \nWhen working one-on-one with students in your beginning class, it is important\nthat the students are ready as soon as the teacher reaches them.  While other\nstudents are waiting, they must either be paying attention to what you are\ndoing…..or working on a music theory worksheet, etc.\nWhile going around the room, students should not be allowed to make sounds on\ntheir set-up—even if they have already been assisted.  They should also not be\nallowed to improperly hold their set-up (i.e. putting a finger in the bottom of their\nneck…..twirling or playing with the set-up in general……etc.\nThe instructor must place all mouthpiece and neck for students.  This may\ncontinue for 2-5 days (if not longer), depending on the size and overall ability\nlevel of your class.\nYou should be directly in front of each individual student when assisting them,\nand not to the side. It would be most effective if students were standing and\n“finding their horizon.”  Music stands should be elevated to the proper height,\nand a mirror should be properly positioned on each stand.  You will learn to\nmaneuver around each student’s equipment, etc.  At this point, all cases should be\ndirectly under or to the side of their chairs.\nAs you are working with each student, your goal is to assist each student in\nmaking a quality sound on or in the vicinity of the correct pitch (second space A-\nflat).  Do not get on to students who do not produce the exact pitch—especially if\nthey are using brands of mouthpieces and ligatures that may be inferior and/or not\non your recommended list.  When listening to each student, listen for:\no  quality of sound\no  consistency of sound\no  pitch\nUnless the saxophone is your primary instrument, you should not be modeling\nsounds on the set-up.  As you assist each student, you will eventually find a “star\nstudent” who will become the model for future reference.  Be sure to periodically\nuse a keyboard or a metronome—with pitches—so as not to “lose sight” of the\ncorrect pitch (regardless of whether or not a model is used).\nBe aware of fragile and/or teary-eyed students. Move on to the next student in the\ninterest of time, but make an effort to return to these students by the end of class.\nDo not let a student leave class feeling unsuccessful.  If possible, offer a pass for\nstruggling students to come in at lunch or before/after school.\nThe set-up always goes to the student; not the student to the set-up.\nBefore bringing the set-up to the student, check for:\nligatures that have been placed correctly\nligature screws that are too tight\no\no  proper mouthpiece angles\no  proper alignment of the reed\no  condition of reeds\nTrain students not to move their faces or body when you are placing the set-up. It\nmay take certain students multiple tries, and if they move after each attempt, they\n(and you!) basically have to start over each time.\nWhen students breathe, do not allow their corners to pull back at all.\nFurthermore, upper lips should not be coming off the plastic of the tops of the\nmouthpieces.  Students should breathe only through their corners, keeping their\nupper lips on the tops of the mouthpieces.\nWith the set-up, students should progress through the following steps:\no  air (The sound starts and ends with air, making students aware of how\nthey can control their air.  This also helps students avoid undue tightness\nin the embouchure.)\no  air~vibration~air (The air “turns into” a vibration and returns to air.)\no  air~vibration\no  vibration (ultimate “final” sound)\nNo articulation syllable should be used when making set-up sounds.  The ultimate\ngoal is for students to start their sounds with air.  An articulation syllable will be\nassigned after all students are making characteristic and consistent sounds on the\nset-up, as well as the fully-assembled saxophone.\nStudents need to direct their air through an imaginary dot, which is at the center of\ntheir mouthpiece and reed, in order to achieve the desired sound.\nMake sure the students understand that “a sound” may not happen the very first\ntime. This is a trial and error process and may take multiple tries.\nOnce the set-up has been placed correctly and students are making the sound you\nwant, they need to remember:\no  how it looks (by looking in the mirror)\no  how it feels\nAllow and instruct them to take the set-up from your hand without moving their\nbody and embouchure.  Have them try to reproduce the sound on their own.  Be\nprepared to further assist them if necessary.  When the sound is correct, students\nneed to remember how it sounds.\nTrain students to freeze their body, face and embouchure at the end of whatever\ntype of sound is being made (whether it is air, a tone, etc.)  The student should not\nmove anything until the director calls the students to ready position.  This aspect\nof playing should transfer to any—and everything students play in the future (i.e.\nafter last notes of lines out of the book, last notes of songs, etc.)\nWhether students are making individual or group sounds, they need to stop when\nthey feel like they are running out of air.  It should never be thought of as a\ncontest to see who can hold their sounds the longest.  That serves absolutely no\nbenefit.\nIf a student feels dizzy or faint, allow them to bend over in their chair for a little\nwhile until they feel better.\nIf you feel air escaping from the student’s embouchure, the student is most likely\nnot sealing properly.  This is usually caused by students pulling their corners\nback.  Students need to constantly be told to bring their corners forward.  After a\nstudent has been made aware that they are leaking air, the expectation should be\nstated for the student to return to class the next day without that issue.\nWhile students are playing, it may be necessary to gently wiggle their mouthpiece\nfrom side to side, during which you will hear pitch variation.  This is simply\nmaking the student aware that their corners are not firm and/or their top teeth are\nnot on the top of the mouthpiece.  Ultimately, you should not be able to move the\nmouthpiece at all.\nThe teacher should always forewarn a student before removing the mouthpiece\nfrom the student’s mouth.  The mouthpiece can easily scrape the teeth or create\ndiscomfort.\nIf you are too easily able to slide the mouthpiece out of a student’s mouth, their\ntop teeth are most likely not on the top of the mouthpiece like they should be.\nThis also means that students are holding the mouthpiece with their lips instead of\ntheir teeth.\nExtraneous noises at ends of sounds are a result of students collapsing their\nembouchures and/or postures.  Have students sing “la” or “dah”; then, apply that\nto the end of their sound.\nIt is your job, as the teacher, to diagnose any problems through this trial and error\nprocess.  As you go around the room, it may be helpful to you to take written\nnotes on students having problems.  Jot down any catchphrases, analogies or\nspecific things that you said to them that helped them in any way!\nIf you are struggling in your efforts to assist multiple students…..or are unsure\nabout what you are doing in general, then hire an outside consultant or\nexperienced private lesson teacher to come to your class and help.  As this\nprofessional goes around the room to hear your students, you need to follow\nthem……watch exactly what they are doing…..and take notes as well.  No\nmatter the scenario, reference these notes as you see fit in future classes.\nIf you have a large class, it may be necessary for “waiting” students to re-soak\ntheir reeds after ________ students have played.\nAfter _____ days, students will eventually need to be able to place their set-up\nand make a sound without your assistance.  The amount of time will vary year to\nyear, taking into consideration the size of the class, the overall quality of their\nsounds, and how many times you have assisted the students.\nStudents need to constantly be reminded that characteristic and consistent\nset-up sounds are stepping stones to making sounds on the fully-assembled\nsaxophone!  Students who do not practice their set-up sounds at home are\nnot only slowing the class down, but are not contributing to the daily\nprogress and quality of the class.\n**Much of this information is applicable to beginner interviews."

    "text": "SAXOPHONE EXTENDED FINGER\nTECHNIQUES\nExtended finger techniques refer to the use of the pinky keys of the left and\nright hand as well as the palm keys. Developing efficient technique in these\nareas is vital to the student’s ability to play technically.\nPalm Keys\nHigh D – “PK 1”\no  Use the LH index finger, 1st (big) knuckle.\no  Keep the other fingers curved and hovering over the pearls.\nHigh D # - “PK 1 and 2”\no  Use the LH index finger, 2nd (middle) knuckle\no  Keep the other fingers curved, relaxed, and hovering\no  This is where tension begins to creep into the palm – keep it\nrelaxed\nHigh E – “PK 1 and 2”  plus RH top side key\no  Left hand remains the same – keep it relaxed.\no  Add the top side key in the RH – use the space between the big\nand middle knuckle.\n  It is VERY IMPORTANT that the student’s right hand\nposition stay as close to normal as possible. Ensure the\nright hand fingers stay as close to hovering over the\npearls as possible. Students tend to contort and move the\nentire hand to activate this key, which is inefficient.\nHigh F – “PK 1, 2 and 3” plus RH top side key\no  Left hand adds the third palm key using the 2nd (middle\nknuckle) of the LH middle finger….not the index finger!\no  Keep the palm soft and relaxed.\no  Hand should remain curved.\no  Like high E, the RH hand position should stay as close to\nnormal as possible.\nBeginning students have smaller hands, so you will have to be forgiving if\ntheir hands are not quite big enough to execute the technique exactly as\nlisted. Some exceptions will have to be made. Have students practice palm\nkey exercises (provided) every other day for short intervals as their hands\nwill get tired.\nPinky Keys\nIt is most important that the pinkies to do not “lock up” when engaging these\nkeys in the left or right hand.\nRight Hand\nWhen moving from the E flat (upstairs) key to the C (downstairs) key,\nit is important to land on the roller, never past it. Slide roller to roller,\nNOT key to key.\nPractice exercises moving from E-flat to C not playing and playing.\nPractice these in short intervals as the pinkies will get tired. Teach\nyour students to work on these two or three times during their practice\nsession for short amounts of time every other day.\nLeft Hand\nWhen using the LH pinky, it is important that students NEVER pick\nthe pinky up when moving between keys!\nWhen using the C#/Db and the B key, slide roller to roller, NOT key\nto key.\nWhen using Bb, students can either move roller to roller, or pivot the\nLH pinky down.\nPractice exercises moving from C#/Db to B, and B to B-flat (harder).\nSame practice rules apply.\nG #/ Ab (1)\nB (3) “inside”\nC#/Db (2)\n“outside”\nBb (4)"

These reeds are in the traditional blue box which contain ten reeds per box.\nAnother choice students have is the Vandoren V12s (gray box), which are for more\nadvanced players.\nRico Reserve reeds are mediocre reeds (green/white box).\nRico Reserve Classic reeds (green/white box) are wonderful reeds, but should only be\nused for professional playing.\nDo not use Vandoren Java (green box) or Vandoren ZZ (black box).\nare file-cut Java reeds)\nDo not use Vandoren V16’s, which are reeds used for jazz (green box).\nDo not use Vandoren “hand select” reeds (black box).  They are over $40 a box.\nLa Voz is a cheaper option of a reed, but is not recommended for long term use. They are\nfine, however, to use with beginners.\nBrands to Avoid\nRico (or at least for long-term use), Riyin\nAny flavored reeds\nAny plastic reeds\nIn handouts given out at the beginning of the year, inform parents about purchasing reeds.  Try to\narrange it so students only buy reeds from the school.  Be sure the parents know that by\npurchasing the reeds from the school, they will receive a “___ percent” discount.  Make\narrangements with your road man to facilitate this process.\nReed Strength\nVandoren: Beginners should begin on 2 ½ .  It is perfectly acceptable for a first/second\nyear student to remain on 2 ½ for a long period of time.  Students may progress to 3’s\nas time goes by.  Every student will change reed strength at different times.  Most\nadvanced students should remain on 3’s for classical saxophone playing.\n1, 1 ½, and 2 reeds are made.\n4 and 5 strength reeds are made as well, but should be used by older players who know\nhow to shave them down.\n1/2 La Voz: medium or soft strength\nMS/JH tenor and bari saxophone players should begin on Vandoren 2 ½’s.\nHS tenor sax players may progress to 3…maybe 3 ½’s.\nHS bari sax players may progress to 3’s.\nFinding a Good Reed\nJust because a reed is new, it does not mean that it will sound good.\nYou can tell a good reed from a bad reed by sight.\no  Good reeds are yellow or crème colored on the heart.\no  Bad reeds have visible veins.\no  Bad reeds are transparent.\n-You reserve the right to tell a student that a reed can no longer be played.  Use sensitivity when\ntelling a student a reed is bad.\n- To monitor quality of reeds, be sure to hear students play EVERY DAY!\nReed Guards\nEach student must have a reed guard.\nThe recommended brand is the Vandoren reed guard which holds 4 reeds.\no  The dehumidifier may be removed.\no  Be sure students wipe off excess moisture before returning reeds to the reed\nguard.\no  Students should never get down to only one reed in the holder.\no  When student is down to the last 4 reeds from their box, they must buy new reeds!\nStudents MUST have their reed guard in class every day.\nReed Rotation\nReed guards must have slots that are labeled\n4 reeds should be in the rotation\nReeds should be rotated each time a student plays\nWarped Reeds\n*This process should not be done by middle school students\nWet the reed.\nRub it on a clean piece of paper in circles.\nAlso rub the top of the reed and try to work the warps out of the cane.\nScraping Reeds\nCheck reed in the light to see if it is balanced.\nScrape parts to make an equal balance on either side of the reed.\nBe sure to not scrape the tip or the heart of the reed.\nBe careful not to scrape off too much."

    "text": "ALTO SAXOPHONE CASES,\nIDENTIFICATION OF PARTS AND\nREMOVING IT FROM ITS CASE\nGeneral Information About All Woodwind Instrument Cases\nMost cases have distinguishing marks somewhere on the case.\nIdentify these marks, and their relationship to the top and bottom of\nthe case. Most cases have the handles placed on the bottom section\nof each case.  Check to make sure.\nPlace all saxophone cases on the floor in front of the student.\nBe sure the student understands where each part of the instrument belongs in\nthe case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make\nsure the student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure\nthe parts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse order they\nwere removed.\nAll instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure\nexplicitly every time.\nNever leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up,\nbut this is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.\nCheck each opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to\nyour students.\nCases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom\nsetup for each student’s case.  If using an ensemble room for the class, the\ncases may be opened in the hall.  The empty case will remain closed and\nlatched in the hall during class.\nIdentifying Parts of the Saxophone and Removing It Safely From Its Case\nOnce the case information is understood, place the case on the floor.  Never let\nthe student place the case in his lap.\nOpen the case from its correct position.  Remember, most latches will lift up.\nAs you begin to teach the saxophone, give only the body of the instrument to\nthe students.  Place the other parts in a plastic bag with the student’s name on it,\nand place it in a locked cabinet in your office.\nTell the student as soon as he proves he can take care of the body of the\nsaxophone, he can be given other parts to his instrument.\nTo sell this concept to the parents, explain the money factor.  It is almost as\nexpensive to replace one broken item as it is to buy an entire instrument.\nIdentify the neck strap and demonstrate its use.\nIdentify the neck, mouthpiece, ligature and reed.\nSEND SEGMENTS OF THIS INFORMATION HOME TO PARENTS.\nCHOOSE THE INFORMATION YOU THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL\nFOR HOME PRACTICE AND INSTRUMENT CARE.\nLook at the case in relation to the parts of the saxophone.  Most cases are\nmolded to the shape of the particular parts.  Be specific when making this point\nto your students.  Take your time, and repeat the information many times.\nCorks on the neck of a new beginner instrument are usually really fat.  The\nmouthpiece will not easily fit on the neck.  Only someone with experience\nshould carefully sand the cork to the proper size.  Use a very fine sand paper\n(400).  Be very careful.  Take off a very small amount and test many times until\nyou have the correct fit that can easily be controlled by a small child.\nAfter sanding, apply the correct amount of cork grease for the student the first\ntime.  Even if the student understands how little is needed, you still must watch\nthem apply the cork grease several times before you trust them to do the job\nalone.  Never let the student have his own tube of cork grease in the beginning\nof the learning process.  After he has proven his competence, he may have the\ntube.  If the cork looks dull, and the mouthpiece is difficult to fit with the neck,\na small amount of cork grease may be needed.  Teach him to ask you first\nbefore applying.  Once you know he has made the correct analysis, the student\nmay make his own decisions.  Cork grease can mess up the inside of the case if\nthe tube is not completely closed, and can even damage the key mechanism if it\ncomes in contact with the metal.\nThe body of the saxophone is one “unit” in its case and is easily placed into and\ntaken from the case.\nThe mouthpiece has a thin end and a fat end.  The top is curved, and the bottom\n(table) is flat.  The importance of these features will be explained later.\nThe ligature is usually metal for the beginning instrument.  The screws for the\nligature will always appear on the right side of the mouthpiece as the student\nlooks at the mouthpiece from the flat side.  This will be demonstrated.  Screws\nfor ligatures will never appear on the left side of the mouthpiece.  The ligature\nhas a large end and a small end.\nThe reed is basically the same shape as the mouthpiece.  It has a thin end and a\nfat end…..a flat side and a curved side.\nThe reed/mouthpiece cap (protector) should be made of plastic for the\nbeginning instrument.  If metal protectors are used, be aware that they will\nmost likely scratch the mouthpiece and perhaps damage the tip of the reed.\nUsing a plastic protector will result in fewer broken reeds.\nThe table (flat part) of the mouthpiece may not necessarily be exactly flat.  To\nfix this, use the finest sandpaper (400).  Place the sandpaper on a piece of glass.\nRub the table of the mouthpiece on the combined surface of sandpaper and\nglass.  Check often to see if the mouthpiece does not “rock” when placed\nagainst the plate glass.\nPeriodically have mouthpiece checks.  Check for chips on rails and on the tip.\nAlso check for chips on the inside of the tip.  Give written work to your\nstudents while you check each mouthpiece carefully.  A chipped mouthpiece\ncan be devastating to a beginning saxophone student’s embouchure\ndevelopment.\nHave frequent reed checks.  Do not allow your students to use chipped or dirty\nreeds.  Reserve the right to break a reed at any time in the most professional\nmanner possible.  Make sure the parents understand the reason for this action.\nThis is why we suggest you start with less expensive reeds for the first few\nweeks.  After students learn to take care of their reeds, more expensive reeds\ncan be used successfully.  Reeds will warp.  A demonstration will be given of\nhow to moisten and “straighten” a reed that has warped.  Using a reed guard\nwill help keep reeds from warping so badly.\nAll students should have a reed guard, and all reeds should be placed in the\nguard at all times. Four-slotted reed guards are recommended, and are\nmanufactured by Vandoren.  The dehumidifier will need to be removed.\nStudents should either number or “letter” each slot.  Each time a student plays\ntheir saxophone, a different reed should be used in rotation.\nConsider using an old or unused DRY reed to be placed on the mouthpiece at\nthe end of each playing session, whether it is at school or at home.  This will\nallow the ligature to always remain in the shape it is in when the student is\n“playing” the saxophone.\nStudents should have a lint-free cloth in their cases.  It can be used in various\nways such are wiping moisture off keys, etc. after use.  No music, folders, or\nunnecessary objects may be placed in the case at any time.  Only the parts of\nthe saxophone should be allowed in the case.\nThe use of the swab must be carefully explained, and a quality silk swab should\nbe included in the cost of the maintenance kit.  Even more importantly, the\nstudent should be given CLASS TIME to clean out his instrument, and store\nhis reed and instrument properly in the case.  Always leave the ligature on the\nmouthpiece with a dry reed replacing the “class reed.”  This will prevent\ndamage, and allow the ligature to form and bond more correctly with the\nmouthpiece.  DRY REEDS MUST BE USED FOR THIS PURPOSE.  A\n“USED/WET” REED WILL RESULT IN MOLD OR MILDEW\nFORMING ON THE REED, IN THE MOUTHPIECE AND THE CASE."

    "text": "SAXOPHONE EXERCISES FOR GROUP SOUNDS\nGroup exercises—whether on the neck and mouthpiece (“short instrument” or “baby\ninstrument”) or the fully-assembled saxophone—should be performed with the assumption\nthat you have gone around the room as much as necessary before allowing students to\nmake sounds on their own in this group setting.\nYou must make the decision as to when to allow short instruments to go home with your\nstudents.\nThe use of mirrors is imperative so students are consistent with everything they are doing.\nBreathing should already be introduced by this point.\nThe metronome should already be introduced by this point.\nFor exercises 1-6, articulation has not been taught at this time; therefore, air starts are\nused.  The tongue should remain naturally at the bottom of the mouth.\nRemind students to always be thinking pulse……as well as “start” and “stop” when\nappropriate.\nWhen appropriate for a specific exercise, audiation of note names with actual pitches is\nhighly recommended.\nMOUTHPIECE AND NECK EXERCISES\n1.   Drill “ready position” and “playing/set position” DAILY.\na.  Call students to “ready position”….then to “playing/set position”……..and back\nto “ready position”, etc.  For shorter/faster instructions, simply say “ready” and\n“set/playing.”\nb.  Repeat this over and over and over.\nc.  This teaches students how to set their short instruments.\nd.  Students should look at their mirrors! DO NOT make them look at you.\n2.  Allow students to make sounds on their own.\na.  Students must exhibit good posture.\nb.  Students should be holding their short instrument correctly.\nc.  Students should be taking proper breaths.\nd.  You, the instructor, need to monitor students.  DO NOT bury your head in the\nstand.\nFor all exercises that use the metronome, students can lightly tap their right hand fingers\non top of the neck for keeping track of the beats.  Quarter note = 80 (with subdivisions) is a\ngood tempo to perform all exercises at.\n3.   With a model playing (or you if saxophone is your primary instrument)\na.  All students should be looking at the model, who should be standing directly\ncentered and in front of the class.  The instructor should be walking around the\nclassroom and monitoring students.\nb.  There should never be an overlap of sound between the model and the class;\nalways place a whole rest between the model and the class.\nc.  Teach students the “start…stop” drill (using audiation).\nd.  The model and the entire class should breathe on beat 3 (when in 4/4 time).\ne.  Sound the subdivision on the metronome at ALL TIMES. Start this at the very\nbeginning.  If students are having trouble, help them with their foot tap by putting\nyour foot on top of theirs.\nf.  During rests and while the model is playing, you must talk to students about the\nnecessity about staying completely set.  This will more quickly help students to\nlearn where exactly to place their short instrument.  The students should look so\nstill to the point that they look like they are still playing!\ng.  The only embouchure movement that is allowed is for students that are having\ndifficulty making a sound…..and need to adjust something in order to achieve a\nsound.\n4.  Model, Student A, Model, Student B, Model, Student C, etc.\na.  Always place a whole rest in between the model and the student.\nb.  After every few students play, have the entire class play as a group.\nc.  The model should be walking around the classroom with the instructor, so that all\nstudents can easily see the model’s embouchure, etc.\nd.  Depending on the size of your class, it is your decision to have students stay in\n“playing/set position” the entire time…..or instead allow students to be in\n“playing/set position” after every ___ students.\n5.  Have all students stand and individually play one sound; if they do not get a sound for\nany reason, they have to sit down.  \na.  The metronome is not used for this exercise.\nb.  Tell students that do not get sounds that they need to practice more at home!\nc.  Have some sort of incentive for those students who are still standing at the end of\none or more rotations.\n6.  Entire class—without a model—playing whole note, whole rest, etc… with the\nmetronome.\na.  Perform this type of exercise when you feel the class is ready.\nb.  Before students play, have them audiate using “start……..stop.”\n7.  Entire class playing two articulated and connected whole notes followed by a whole rest,\nrepeat, etc.  At this point, articulation must have already been taught.\na.  Again, students can audiate the “start….stop” drill.\nb.  Students are thinking “dah.”\n8.  Entire class playing two articulated and connected half notes followed by a whole rest,\nrepeat, etc.\nb.  Students are thinking “dah”.\n9.  The instructor or model performs random—yet not complicated—rhythms, while the\nentire class imitates.\na.  Perform this exercise both with and without whole rests in between the\nmodel/instructor and the class.\nb.  It would be a good idea to incorporate rhythms—from the beginning band method\nbook used in your class—that not not yet been introduced.\n**EVERY CLASS FOR 1-2 WEEKS MUST BEGIN WITH SOME SORT OF A\nMOUTHPIECE AND NECK EXERCISE!!!!**\nFULLY-ASSEMBLED  SAXOPHONE EXERCISES\n1.  The first note students should play is 3rd space C#/Db.\nThis note can be played before teaching actual hand position.\nAt this point, hand position should already be taught.\n2.  Slur diatonic notes from third space C down to middle C.\n3.  Typical exercises you will see in most beginner method books\nShould be audiated on pitch with actual note names…as well as with “start” and\n“stop”.\nCan be performed with or without articulation\nChanging notes; can be performed with or without articulation\nProgressive adding of more notes; can still be performed with or without\narticulation\nWhen you approach the first line in the book—which contains two or more back-\nto-back notes—these notes must obviously be articulated.  Therefore, you must\nhave already taught articulation with the proper syllable before these lines can be\nattempted.\nWHEN YOU TEACH ARTICULATION, YOU MUST FIRST INTRODUCE IT\nON THE MOUTHPIECE AND NECK."

Before removing the neck strap and saxophone, put the reed in the mouth\nto moisten and smooth the top and bottom of it.  Moistening the bottom of\na reed helps create a seal, which will result in better response.\n2.  Take out the neck strap and put it on.\n3.  Take out the neck and put it in a safe place.\n4.  Take the body out and clip it onto the neck strap.  Never trust that the neck\nstrap will secure the saxophone, because the hooks can easily snap.  Grab\nthe body with the right hand and support the back of the saxophone with\nthe left hand.  DO NOT LET THE SAXOPHONE HANG FROM THE\nNECK STRAP.\n5.  Remove the plug from the saxophone.  All saxophones must have a plug.\nThe plug protects the octave key mechanism, which is very expensive to\nreplace.\n6.  Pick up the neck.\n7.  Hold the octave key open on the neck with the palm of the hand.\n8.  Twist and push the neck onto the body of the saxophone.\n9.  Turn the screw that supports the neck to the first point of resistance.\n10. Place the mouthpiece without the ligature on the neck using slight,\ntwisting motions.  Leave 1/4 to 1/3 of the cork showing on the neck for\nbeginners.\n11. Place the large end of the ligature over the mouthpiece carefully.  Make\nsure the screws are on the right as you look at them from the table of the\nmouthpiece.\n12. Lift the ligature slightly with the thumb and forefinger of a chosen hand,\nand carefully slide the reed onto the table of the mouthpiece.  The reed is\nplaced fat to fat, flat to flat and thin to thin.\n13. Line the sides of the reed up with the rails.\n14. Look for the thin black line/sliver at the tip of the mouthpiece.\n15. The ligature should be slightly below the line on the bottom of most\nquality mouthpieces.\n16. Tighten the lower screw snuggly, and the top screw to its first point of\nresistance.\nInstrument Disassembly\n1.  Unscrew the neck and put in a safe place.  Be sure the octave key is\ndepressed with the palm of the hand as the neck is removed.\n2.  Unhook the body of the saxophone from the neck strap.  Swab the body\nof the instrument.\n3.  Replace the plug in the body.\n4.  Replace the body in the case.\n5.  Pick up the neck and mouthpiece.  Unscrew the ligature and remove the\nreed.  Blot the reed and put in the reed case.\n6.  Remove the ligature from the mouthpiece.\n7.  Remove the mouthpiece from the neck.\n8.  Swab the neck once the mouthpiece has been removed.\n9.  Replace the neck in the case.\n10. The ligature must be left on the mouthpiece with a dry reed and a plastic\nprotector.\n11. Replace the mouthpiece in the case.\nInstrument/Body Ratio\nFamiliarize the student with the instrument/body ratio by using the fully\nassembled saxophone but without the reed.  Be sure the saxophone is adjusted\nto the student by adjusting instrument placement and neck strap length.\nThere are three balance points when holding the saxophone:\n1.  both thumbs\n2.  side of the leg\n3.  neck strap\nMake sure that the body is in its natural playing posture when finding these\nbalance positions.  The student should feel comfortable at all times.  The right\narm should follow the line of the upper body.  It should never be placed back\nbehind the chest cavity.  When these balance points are focused on at one\ntime, the posture will look very natural.  This will be demonstrated.\nCorrect playing position will be realized when all of the aforementioned\ndetails from previous seminars are understood.  The weight of the saxophone\nis difficult to balance without the fulcrum created by the combination of the\nthree balance points."

    "text": "CHARACTERISTICS WHEN RECRUITING AND\nSELECTING SAXOPHONE PLAYERS\nPhysical Characteristics/Factors\nAs the embouchure is rather simple to form correctly, many students are able to play\nsaxophone with the exception of those that have severe underbites.\nUnlike playing flute and high brass instruments, having braces does not hinder students\nplaying saxophone.\nIt is actually acceptable to recruit students on saxophone who are double-jointed, because the\nsize of the instrument and the strength of the key springs support the fingers more than\nsmaller woodwind instruments.\nThere are fewer physical characteristic factors when considering saxophone than most other\nwoodwind instruments.\nNon-Physical Characteristics/Factors\nThe alto saxophone is the most expensive student-owned instruments; thus, use the cost to\nlimit the class size.\nParents need to understand that the monthly cost can be anywhere from $50-$70 per month—\nexcluding the maintenance kit.\nAs much as possible, avoid placing students on saxophone whose family would have\nproblems supporting the cost of the instrument, upkeep and accessories.\nEven though it is easy to place students on saxophone, it should not be treated as a “dumping\nground”. Depending on the number of returning students, the goal should be to allow\nbetween six to nine students in your saxophone class.\nTry to have a separate class for your saxophones. If this can not happen, combine the\nsaxophone class with your double reed class. Your double reed class will move as fast—if\nnot faster—than your saxophone class.\nIf combined with double reed students, find a private teacher or a specialist to periodically\ninstruct your saxophone students. If a specialist cannot be found for your saxophone students,\nfind a specialist/private teacher for your double reed students and pull those students out\nperiodically.\nDO NOT combine your saxophone class with your flute or clarinet classes. Flute and clarinet\nclasses will move much slower than your saxophone class because of the amount of time\nspent on the embouchure, hand position and flexibility (flute). Your saxophone students will\nbecome bored and possibly cause classroom management problems.\nThe saxophone class needs to be taught in a smaller room. Not only will you be able to limit\nthe class size to 6-9 students, but you will find it easier to dissuade pushy\nparents/administrators from trying to force additional students into the class. Place your\nsaxophone class opposite a larger class like trumpet, clarinet, or flute. Place the larger class\nin the band hall and the saxophone class in a smaller room.\nAllowing a student to play the tenor saxophone in a beginner class should only be allowed\nunder extreme financial circumstances…..or with an unexpected move-in that allowed the\nstudent to play tenor saxophone at their previous school."

Fingers should be placed on the pearls.  The fleshy part will touch the\npearls.\n4.  The little finger should rest on the roller keys.  “Home position” will be\nthe E-flat key, which is the higher of the two keys.\n5.  Fingers should be curved and round—not flat.\n6.  The wrist must stay in line with the rest of the forearm.\n7.  Practice moving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.  Do not\nlet the other two knuckles move.  The finger pads should stay on the pearls\nat all times.  In the beginning the little finger can move up and down also.\n8.  Do not include side keys in the initial hand position information.  If asked,\ntell them once the hands can move correctly using the rings and tone\nholes, they will be allowed to learn to use the keys on the side.\nLEFT HAND POSITION\n1.  The left thumb rests on the back thumb rest and never leaves.  The second\nknuckle should basically be in the middle of the thumb rest.\n2.  Place the index finger on the first pearl.\n3.  Ship the small pearl.\n4.  Place the middle and ring finger on the next two pearls.  The finger pads\nshould stay on the pearls at all times.\n5.  The little finger should rest at the “home key” on the G-sharp key.\n6.  Fingers should be curved and round—not ever flat.\n7.  Keep the hand in an adjusted “Flat-C” position and the wrist slightly up.\nThe wrist must stay in line with the rest of the forearm.  This will be\ndemonstrated.\n8.  Always feel the palm of the hands to check for the softness of the fingers.\nThere are more bones in this area of the hand than any other part of the\nbody.  If the palm is soft, all other parts of the hand will be as naturally\nsoft as is possible.  The little fingers should have comfortable “home\nkeys” they touch all of the time in the beginning stages.\nFINGER EXERCISES\n1.  All fingers in each hand move together.  Call out the hand you wish to\nmove.  The students move all of the fingers in that hand down never\nleaving the pearls.  The right hand thumb obviously does not ever move\nwhen the teacher asks for “RIGHT”, but the left hand thumb can move\nwith the fingers of the left hand when the teacher asks for “LEFT”.\n2.  Next, we move the fingers one at a time beginning with the left hand.  The\nthumb and first finger are already down in this exercise, and each\nadditional finger in both hands will be numbered two through six from top\nof the body to the bottom of the body. The fingers will move down or up\ndepending on their starting position, as the number is called by the teacher.\nWe do not use the little fingers when we first begin this exercise.\n3.  Watch the fingers to see that they move smoothly in constant contact with\nthe pearls, in natural position and move up and down from the big knuckle\nonly.  The student should understand that the movement is aided by the\nsoft tissue of the palm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top\nof the hand.\n4.  Next, we move the fingers in combinations: one, two….one, two\nthree…….one, two, three, four……one, two, three, four, five…..one, two,\nthree, four, five, six………six, five, four, three, two, one……five, four,\nthree, two, one…….four, three, two, one……three, two, one………two,\none……  Later the development of moving the first and second finger\nseparately is added.\n5.  Using these exercises, the fingers move in all of the ways they move to\nplay the saxophone: all together, one at a time, and in combinations.  This\nexercise will be demonstrated.\n6.  Refer to your supplemental page regarding exercises to perfect the usage\nof the roller keys and palm keys.  These exercises must not be introduced\ntoo early in the development of a student’s hand position."

    "text": "SAXOPHONE EMBOUCHURE\nStudents must be able to use air correctly before beginning to learn the\nsaxophone embouchure.\nUse the neck and mouthpiece for better control.\nThe  teacher  should  place  the  neck  and  mouthpiece  in  the  beginning.    Place  the\nbottom lip first, then the upper teeth and top lip.\nThe student needs to remember how it feels and sounds.\nOnce the teacher has demonstrated how it feels and sounds, the\nstudent can hold the neck and mouthpiece in place and watch\nhis  face  in  a  mirror  to  make  sure  nothing  moves  or  looks  unnatural.    Then,  the\nstudent remembers how it looks, feels and sounds.\nIt  is  best  to  hold  the  neck  and  mouthpiece  with  two  fingers  and  a  thumb  in  a\nbalanced  manner.    The  fingers  should  have  absolutely  no  contact  with  the\nmouthpiece or ligature.\nThe mouthpiece is held by the teeth, not the lips.\nThe upper teeth rest on the mouthpiece material (patch).\nThe lower teeth feel the reed through the lower lip that covers them.\nThe lower lip covers the lower teeth like a fitted sheet covers a mattress.\nThe back teeth are naturally apart.\nThe  tongue  is  in  the  “ah”  or  “ew”  position…..and  not  pulled  back.    For  tenor\nsaxophone,  the  tongue  is  in  the  “ah”  position,  and  “oh”  for  the  baritone\nsaxophone.\nUsing the index finger, gently push the lower lip toward, but not rolled\nover the lower teeth.  Lick the part that goes over.  That is the correct amount.\nThe  saxophone  embouchure  is  created  with  a  natural  overbite  position  with  a\nslight valley in the chin.\nThe  corners  are  toward  the  mouthpiece.    Ultimately,  the  corners  will  be  toward\nthe mouthpiece and down.\nThere should be no wrinkles in the lower lip and red flesh must be seen\non either side of the mouthpiece.\nThe lower lip that is not under the reed stays in front of the teeth.\nNever tell students to pull their lips over their teeth.  Pulling and stretching makes\nlips thicker.\nThe upper lip rests on top of the mouthpiece in front of the upper teeth.\nThe upper lip should be soft and pliable, and follow the shape/contour of the\nmouthpiece.\nBoth the top and bottom lip should always feel soft and natural.\nThere should be no lines or dimples that do not appear in the natural face.  The\nface essentially should be “zombie”-like.\nThe air is directed through an imaginary dot, which is at the center of their\nmouthpiece and reed.\nEnough mouthpiece must be past the lips into the chamber of the mouth to allow\nthe reed to freely vibrate.  Usually less than half the mouthpiece is sufficient.\nThere must be a resonant second space treble clef concert A-flat sounded.\nIf the sound is stuffy, the student may be holding the mouthpiece with the lips.\nIf the sound is strident and brittle, the student may have too much mouthpiece\nin his mouth or may be using too much unfocused air.\nBe sure the student can control the air well enough to find the correct balance of\nair and resistance to create the sound you want on the neck and mouthpiece.\nRemember that the mouth can be too open; the teeth can be out of position; the\nlips can be too loose and puffy or can grip; the tongue can be too far back in the\nmouth; the student can be lifting too little.  All of these will result in a sound you\nwill not wish to create.\nKeep making subtle adjustments to the angle, amount of mouthpiece taken, etc.\nJust a slight movement can really improve the resonance of the vibration.\nKeep the body and face calm and still while learning this embouchure.\nThe embouchure is a constant work in progress.  Special attention should be given\nto the contact of the upper teeth with the mouthpiece material.  The teacher can\nattempt to move the mouthpiece out of position to make the student aware that\nsomething is incorrect.\nIt is easier to make something firmer than to get rid of unnecessary tightness.\nIf the sound is not clear, instant and resonant on the neck and mouthpiece, the\nsound on the saxophone will not be resonant and beautiful.\nWhen the neck and mouthpiece is placed on the body of the saxophone, the first\nattempt at sound production should be made with the teacher’s assistance.\nIf a student plays above pitch, they may be biting down on their mouthpiece or the\nmouthpiece may be too far in the mouth.

    "text": "SAXOPHONE ARTICULATION EXERCISES\nWhen starting articulation exercises, the use of mirrors is vital.\nRemind students that the tongue only interrupts the air – it never stops the air.\nArticulating with black notes as opposed to white notes, encourages students to move\ntheir tongues down quicker.\nMake sure from the very beginning, students sing and play in a connected/legato style.\nExercises to be taught in the following order:\n1.  Have students sing on “dah” and then ultimately on the French syllable “dih” or even\n“doo.” If students are unable to sing in a connected style, they should not progress to\nthe next step.\n2.  Have students put their hand or index finger in front of their face and feel their air.\nStudents should feel continuous air and not “puffs” of air.\n3.  Go around the room and have each student tongue air at your hand, so you can assess\ntheir ability to do it correctly.\n4.  Using a mirror, students should articulate with or without their hand/index finger,\nmaking sure that their face, chin, and throat are not moving.\n5.  When you feel students have mastered the previous exercises, allow them to articulate\n– using the syllable “dah” or “dih” – on the mouthpiece and neck.  Students should\nput their left hands under their neck so they can feel a continuous stream of air while\nthey are articulating.  Students who do not feel continuous air need to be verbally\nmade aware that they are not articulating correctly.\n** Students should start with their tongue on the reed to create the articulation.\nThe tongue then falls down and returns to its “at rest” position in the bottom of the\nmouth.  One taste bud of the student’s tongue should touch the flat part of the reed,\nwhere the imaginary “dot” at the tip has been all along.  The air and tongue go to\nthis same “dot.”\n6.  Allow students to articulate as fast as they can.\n7.  Allow the students to start the sound and use the \"ta-day\" syllable.\n8.  Allow the students to start the sound and articulate by snapping your finger on\ncommand.\n9.  With the metronome, begin to incorporate easy follow-the-leader rhythms with you\nsinging or modeling – and the students echoing on their mouthpiece and neck.  Whole\nrests may or may not be necessary between you and the students.  As with your initial\nsound production exercises, students need to continue counting with their fingers –\nwith their left hand – while they are playing.  This ensures that students are thinking\ninternal subdivision.\n10. Before progressing to the fully-assembled saxophone, assign the following playing\ntest on the mouthpiece and neck:\nAttach the mouthpiece and neck to the saxophone and begin articulation.  Students must\nbe constantly reminded that they should be articulating in the same way as they were\nwhen just using the mouthpiece and neck.\nWhether students are playing white notes or black notes, they must constantly be\nreminded that the tongue moves down quickly.\nWhen students can successfully sing note names on the same pitch, allow them to\narticulate multiple notes on the same pitch.\nWhen pulse and foot pat are learned, students articulate every time their foot touches the\nfloor – and then when their foot touches the floor and as it comes up.\nOnce the student is able to read music, call the articulation \"rhythmic articulation\".\nStudents should be tonguing as the music moves across the page.\nDo not allow students to articulate back-to-back notes on different pitches until they are\nplaying with absolute connected style on notes of the same pitch.\nWhen the tongue is moving correctly, you must decide when it is appropriate to have\nstudents begin coordinating finger movement with articulation.\nWhen students articulate back-to-back notes on different pitches, they cannot stop their\nair as they change fingerings.\nTeach Mary Had a Little Lamb in four segments by singing and then playing:\nAfter all students have successfully played each segment of Mary Had a Little Lamb,\nbegin to string together the segments into the following finished product:\nUltimately, students should be able to execute any or all of the following on a daily basis:\no  articulate as fast as they can\no  articulate using the \"ta-day\" syllable\no  articulate on command\no  articulate with foot pat and articulate rhythms\nWhen playing exercises out of the method book, you can return to previously-learned\nlines and add articulation.  Do not feel like all lines must be executed again during class;\nassign students to perform all lines at home with articulation."

Teaching vibrato in\ngeneral should NOT be optional during the second semester of the beginning\nyear.\nThe eight points of vibrato:\n1.  Vibrato  is  solely  a  jaw  movement.    As  students  advance,  it  becomes  a\nbottom lip and jaw movement.\n2.  No pinching or biting of the reed can be done.\n3.  The jaw moves down and then back up to its natural position.\n4.  The syllable used for vibrato is “vuh”.\n5.  Vibrato will sound big/obnoxious at first.\n6.  After  introducing  vibrato,  do  movements  with  triplet  subdivisions  on the\nmetronome.\n7.

These models are hand-made, have a darker\nsound, have heavier key action and are not recommended.\nAvoid the Yamaha “Custom Z” model. This model produces a\nbrighter sound, but has an easier lower register.\nIn the Austin area, there is a large presence of Mark VI alto\nsaxophones.  These instruments were manufactured between 1958-\n1967 and currently cost around $6000; thus, they are obviously\nconsidered professional models.  Although some may say this\ninstrument has the most desirable sound quality, others would argue\nthat point and say they are very difficult to play."

Tighten the screw to its first point of\nresistance.  This prevents the ligature from losing shape and the\nface of the mouthpiece being scratched.\no  Students should have a plastic mouthpiece cap over the\nmouthpiece/reed/ligature while in the case at all times.  Caps\nprotect the entire “set-up.”\nCleaning the mouthpiece:\nAfter EACH CLASS, students need to use the end of their silk swab\nto dry out the receiver and tip of the mouthpiece.  It is recommended\nto use the pinky so that it can fit into the receiver and the tip.\nAt home, students are recommended to clean the inside of the\nmouthpiece by using a damp cloth with warm running water and\nantibacterial soap.\nAt home, students are recommended to clean the outside of the\nmouthpiece by putting it in a tea/coffee cup with water and lemon\njuice.  The mouthpiece can be submerged.  This should be done at\nleast 1-2 times a year for 30 minutes.\nWhen cleaning the outsides of mouthpieces, students should be very\ncareful not to scratch the mouthpiece with any hard brushes, sponges\nor “other” things (ligature, pencil, pen, etc.).\nDO NOT BOIL THE MOUTHPIECE OR USE HOT WATER TO\nCLEAN IT! It is hard rubber, and will be destroyed!"

The\nright hand lifts the instrument, and the placement is less difficult or\ncomplicated.  The upper joint can be gently held by the left hand as you\nbegin the awkward process of finding the correct place for every finger.\nThis will be demonstrated.\n2.  Place the fleshy finger pads over the silver rings first.  Without putting\npressure on the finger tips, feel the pads fall into the holes.\n3.  The hand will begin in a straight across angle, and will be in the “flat-C”\nposition.\n4.  Place the thumb on the thumb rest between the rest and the leg.  The\nthumb nail touches the rest. Very little (preferably, no) flesh will touch the\nthumb rest. The thumb joint must always be to the right of the thumb rest,\nnever behind it.\n5.  Turn the clarinet out in front of the student like a spyglass and make sure\nthere is open space between the body of the clarinet and the hand.\n6.  The little finger rests on the most comfortable of the four keys it will use\nlater in this process (either key #1 or #2).\n7.  The middle finger will appear higher because it is longer than the other\nfingers.\n8.  No part of any finger should touch any rod.\n9.  Practice moving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.  Do not\nlet the other two knuckles move.  The finger pads should fall directly into\nthe holes.  In the beginning the little finger can move up and down also.\n10. Lean the clarinet back on the shoulder and look at the right hand fingers as\nyou do this.  While doing this, the left hand must remain in its proper\n“baby” position holding the upper joint.\n11. Make sure to feel all parts of the ring with the finger pads.\n12. Keep the right hand straight across the body of the clarinet for at least 6 to\n8 weeks before moving into the more correct angled position.  This change\nwill be demonstrated.\n13. Do not include side keys in the initial hand position information.  If asked,\ntell them once the hands can move correctly using the rings and tone\nholes, they will be allowed to learn to use the keys on the side.\nLEFT HAND POSITION\n1.  While holding the lower joint gently (not using correct hand position but\nthe proper “baby” position) with the right hand as it rests on the leg, place\nthe middle knuckle of the index finger on the G# key at the top of the\nupper joint.  Place the first knuckle on the A key with the fleshy part of the\ntip angled down toward the first silver ring.  The teacher will have to\nidentify these “named keys” for the student.\n2.  Place the middle finger over the second silver ring.\n3.  Place the ring finger over the third hole with no silver ring.\n4.  Place the thumb over the ring on the back of the upper joint with the\nfleshy part of the end being aware of the long, skinny key (register key).\nThe angle of the thumb should be at “1:00/2:00.”\n5.  The little finger will rest on the most comfortable of the four keys it will\nuse later in this process (either key #1 or #4).\n6.  Keep the hand in an adjusted “Flat-C” position and the wrist slightly up.\nThe wrist must stay in line with the rest of the forearm.\n7.  Continue to rest the clarinet on the leg and watch to see if the left hand\nfollows the line of the upper joint to form the angle of a “V” with the\nupper joint.\n8.  Do not allow the knuckles of the index finger to lose contact with the G#\nand A keys.\n9.  If the thumb is not being used to play specific sounds on the instrument it\nMUST NOT touch the body (wood) of the instrument.\n10. ALWAYS KEEP ONE HAND ON THE CLARINET AT ALL TIMES.\nNEVER SIMPLY LAY IT IN THE LAP.\n11. Beginners can have “fly-away” fingers in the beginning as long as they\nfall back down to the correct rings.  The exception is the left index finger.\nIf we try to get them to keep their fingers in the “finished” position too\nsoon, the hands can become too tense.  Always feel the palm of the hands\nto check for the softness of the fingers.  There are more bones in this area\nof the hand than any other part of the body.  If the palm is soft, all other\nparts of the hand will be as naturally soft as is possible.  The little fingers\nshould have comfortable “home keys” they touch all of the time in the\nbeginning stages.\n12.  Beginning clarinet hand position is very awkward, thus taking longer to\nachieve and more patience from the teacher and student is required.  Do\nnot get in a hurry.\nFINGER EXERCISES\n1.  All fingers in each hand move together.  Call out the hand you wish to\nmove.  The students move all of the fingers in that hand down to seat into\nthe rings and tone holes.  The right hand thumb obviously does not ever\nmove when the teacher asks for “RIGHT”, but the left hand thumb will\nmove to its ring with the fingers of the left hand when the teacher asks for\n“LEFT”.\n2.  Next, we move the fingers one at a time beginning with the left hand.  The\nthumb and first finger are already down in this exercise, and each\nadditional finger in both hands will be numbered two through six from top\nof the upper joint to the bottom of the lower joint. The fingers will move\ndown or up depending on their starting position, as the number is called by\nthe teacher.  We do not use the little fingers when we first begin this\nexercise.  Later, they will be numbered seven and eight.\n3.  Watch the fingers to see that they move smoothly, cover the holes, stay in\nnatural position and move up and down from the big knuckle only.  The\nstudent should understand that the movement is aided by the soft tissue of\nthe palm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand.\n4.  Next, we move the fingers in combinations: one, two….one, two\nthree…….one, two, three, four……one, two, three, four, five…..one, two,\nthree, four, five, six………six, five, four, three, two, one……five, four,\nthree, two, one…….four, three, two, one……three, two, one………two,\none……  Later in the development the thumb movement is added.\n5.  Using these exercises, the fingers move in all of the ways they move to\nplay the clarinet: all together, one at a time, and in combinations.\n6.  When learning to use the little fingers, we number the keys one through\nfour.  The teacher calls out the number, and the student moves the little\nfinger in either hand in a circular motion to the numbered key.  Call the\nnumbers in order: call the numbers backward: call the numbers diagonally:\ncall the numbers in any order you wish.  Begin using the little fingers\nseparately, and then show the students the correlation of the keys on the\nleft and right side of the clarinet."

    "text": "MAKING THE FIRST CLARINET MOUTHPIECE\nAND BARREL SOUND\nInitial sound production cannot be introduced until correct posture and breathing\nhas been successfully taught.  Include these two essential components as “part” of\nthe first sound attempt(s).\nRelax position and ready position should already be taught and drilled prior to\nsound production.  As sound production is occurring, playing position must be\nincorporated.  Students need to understand that ready position means they are\nready to play.  Playing position means that they are set (physically) to play.\nStudents should not be allowed to sit in relax position during class, except maybe\nduring announcements, paperwork or things not pertaining to playing.  If one\nword instructions are preferred, then use “ready” and “set.”\nTry to get every student to make a sound on the first day of sound production.  If\nyou will not be able to accomplish this, make a disclaimer before you start.  The\nstudents who do not end up getting to make their first sound—on the first day—\nwill be the first students you will start with on the second day!  Students should\nnot be surprised or frustrated if you do not get to them on this first day.\nOn day one of sound production, make another disclaimer if you suspect that you\nwill not get far enough along to allow any of the students to take home their “set-\nup”.\nAt the end of each class, you must make the decision to allow just those who you\nassisted to take home their set-up…….or not allow set-ups to go home until\neveryone has made sounds with your assistance (day one, day two, etc.).\nOnce you allow and require set-ups to go home on a daily basis, students should\nbe recording their practice time on whatever form of practice card you are using.\nBe realistic when designating ____ minutes to be spent on their set-up sounds\nduring their home practice.\nIt is not necessary to have students make sounds on just the mouthpiece (without\nthe barrel).  It will be much easier for you……and eventually less awkward for\nthe students…….to hold the mouthpiece and barrel.  If you choose to start on just\nthe mouthpiece, then you are encouraged to add the barrel very soon.\nDo not use a metronome when assisting students to make their first sounds.  A\nmetronome should not be added until the class is at the point of making group\nsounds.\nRemind students that lipstick, Chapstick, etc. cannot be worn during class.\nStudents need to understand that their reeds will not last long, and they will begin\nto see mold.  \nWhen working one-on-one with students in your beginning class, it is important\nthat the students are ready as soon as the teacher reaches them.  While other\nstudents are waiting, they must either be paying attention to what you are\ndoing…..or working on a music theory worksheet, etc.\nWhile going around the room, students should not be allowed to make sounds on\ntheir set-up—even if they have already been assisted.  They should also not be\nallowed to improperly hold their set-up (i.e. putting a finger in the bottom of their\nbarrel…..twirling or playing with the set-up in general……etc.\nThe instructor must place all mouthpiece and barrels for students.  This may\ncontinue for 2-5 days (if not longer), depending on the size and overall ability\nlevel of your class.\nYou should be directly in front of each individual student when assisting them,\nand not to the side. It would be most effective if students were standing and\n“finding their horizon.”  Music stands should be elevated to the proper height, and\na mirror should be properly positioned on each stand.  You will learn to maneuver\naround each student’s equipment, etc.  At this point, all cases should be directly\nunder or to the side of their chairs.\nAs you are working with each student, your goal is to assist each student in\nmaking a quality sound on or in the vicinity of the correct pitch (fifth line F-\nsharp).  Do not get on to students who do not produce the exact pitch—especially\nif they are using brands of mouthpieces and ligatures that may be inferior and/or\nnot on your recommended list.  When listening to each student, listen for:\no  quality of sound\no  consistency of sound\no  pitch\nUnless the clarinet is your primary instrument, you should not be modeling\nsounds on the set-up.  As you assist each student, you will eventually find a “star\nstudent” who will become the model for future reference.  Be sure to periodically\nuse a keyboard or a metronome—with pitches—so as not to “lose sight” of the\ncorrect pitch (regardless of whether or not a model is used).\nBe aware of fragile and/or teary-eyed students. Move on to the next student in the\ninterest of time, but make an effort to return to these students by the end of class.\nDo not let a student leave class feeling unsuccessful.  If possible, offer a pass for\nstruggling students to come in at lunch or before/after school.\nThe set-up always goes to the student; not the student to the set-up.\nBefore bringing the set-up to the student, check for:\nligatures that have been placed correctly\nligature screws that are too tight\no\no  proper mouthpiece angles\no  proper alignment of the reed\no  condition of reeds\nTrain students not to move their faces or body when you are placing the set-up. It\nmay take certain students multiple tries, and if they move after each attempt, they\n(and you!) basically have to start over each time.\nWhen students breathe, do not allow their corners to pull back at all.\nFurthermore, upper lips should not be coming off the plastic of the tops of the\nmouthpieces.  Students should breathe only through their corners, keeping their\nupper lips on the tops of the mouthpieces.\nWith the set-up, students should progress through the following steps:\no  air (The sound starts and ends with air, making students aware of how\nthey can control their air.  This also helps students avoid undue tightness\nin the embouchure.)\no  air~vibration~air (The air “turns into” a vibration and returns to air.)\no  air~vibration\no  vibration (ultimate “final” sound)\nNo articulation syllable should be used when making set-up sounds.  The ultimate\ngoal is for students to start their sounds with air.  An articulation syllable will be\nassigned after all students are making characteristic and consistent sounds on the\nset-up, as well as the fully-assembled clarinet.\nStudents need to direct their air across their reed (to the imaginary dot) in order to\nachieve the desired sound.\nMake sure the students understand that “a sound” may not happen the very first\ntime. This is a trial and error process and may take multiple tries.\nOnce the set-up has been placed correctly and students are making the sound you\nwant, they need to remember:\no  how it looks (by looking in the mirror)\no  how it feels\nAllow and instruct them to take the set-up from your hand without moving their\nbody and embouchure.  Have them try to reproduce the sound on their own.  Be\nprepared to further assist them if necessary.  When the sound is correct, students\nneed to remember how it sounds.\nTrain students to freeze their body, face and embouchure at the end of whatever\ntype of sound is being made (whether it is air, a tone, etc.)  The student should not\nmove anything until the director calls the students to ready position.  This aspect\nof playing should transfer to any—and everything students play in the future (i.e.\nafter last notes of lines out of the book, last notes of songs, etc.)\nWhether students are making individual or group sounds, they need to stop when\nthey feel like they are running out of air.  It should never be thought of as a\ncontest to see who can hold their sounds the longest.  That serves absolutely no\nbenefit.\nIf a student feels dizzy or faint, allow them to bend over in their chair for a little\nwhile until they feel better.\nIf you feel air escaping from the student’s embouchure, the student is most likely\nnot sealing properly.  This is usually caused by students pulling their corners\nback.  Students need to constantly be told to bring their corners forward.  After a\nstudent has been made aware that they are leaking air, the expectation should be\nstated for the student to return to class the next day without that issue.\nWhile students are playing, it may be necessary to gently wiggle their mouthpiece\nfrom side to side, during which you will hear pitch variation.  This is simply\nmaking the student aware that their corners are not firm and/or their top teeth are\nnot on the top of the mouthpiece.  Ultimately, you should not be able to move the\nmouthpiece at all.\nThe teacher should always forewarn a student before removing the mouthpiece\nfrom the student’s mouth.  The mouthpiece can easily scrape the teeth or create\ndiscomfort.\nIf you are too easily able to slide the mouthpiece out of a student’s mouth, their\ntop teeth are most likely not on the top of the mouthpiece like they should be.\nThis also means that students are holding the mouthpiece with their lips instead of\ntheir teeth.\nExtraneous noises at ends of sounds are a result of students collapsing their\nembouchures and/or postures.  Have students sing “la” or “dah”; then, apply that\nto the end of their sound.\nIt is your job, as the teacher, to diagnose any problems through this trial and error\nprocess.  As you go around the room, it may be helpful to you to take written\nnotes on students having problems.  Jot down any catchphrases, analogies or\nspecific things that you said to them that helped them in any way!\nIf you are struggling in your efforts to assist multiple students…..or are unsure\nabout what you are doing in general, then hire an outside consultant or\nexperienced private lesson teacher to come to your class and help.  As this\nprofessional goes around the room to hear your students, you need to follow\nthem……watch exactly what they are doing…..and take notes as well.  No\nmatter the scenario, reference these notes as you see fit in future classes.\nIf you have a large class, it may be necessary for “waiting” students to re-soak\ntheir reeds after ________ students have played.\nAfter _____ days, students will eventually need to be able to place their set-up\nand make a sound without your assistance.  The amount of time will vary year to\nyear, taking into consideration the size of the class, the overall quality of their\nsounds, and how many times you have assisted the students.\nStudents playing bass clarinet need to use the mouthpiece and neck for sound\nproduction.  The neck should be held by the curve closest to the mouthpiece,\navoiding the register key mechanism.  Whether or not the instrument provided to\nthe student has a Charles Bay neck, the angle of the instrument (and the angle of\nthe mouthpiece when not yet on the instrument) must be similar as possible to the\nangle of a B-flat clarinet.\nStudents need to constantly be reminded that characteristic and consistent\nset-up sounds are stepping stones to making sounds on the fully-assembled\nclarinet!  Students who do not practice their set-up sounds at home are not\nonly slowing the class down, but are not contributing to the daily progress\nand quality of the class.\n**Much of this information is applicable to beginner interviews."

Have students sing on “dah” and then ultimately on the French syllable “dih.”  If\nstudents are unable to sing in a connected style, they should not progress to the next\nstep.\n2.  Have students put their hand or index finger in front of their face and feel their air.\nStudents should feel continuous air and not “puffs” of air.\n3.  Go around the room and have each student tongue air at your hand, so you can assess\ntheir ability to do it correctly.\n4.  Using a mirror, students should articulate with or without their hand/index finger,\nmaking sure that their face, chin, and throat are not moving.\n5.  When you feel students have mastered the previous exercises, allow them to articulate\n– using the syllable “dah” or “dih” – on the mouthpiece and barrel.  Students should\nput their left hands under their barrel so they can feel a continuous stream of air while\nthey are articulating.  Students who do not feel continuous air need to be verbally\nmade aware that they are not articulating correctly.\n** Students should start with their tongue on the reed to create the articulation.\nThe tongue then falls down and returns to its “at rest” position in the bottom of the\nmouth.  One taste bud of the student’s tongue should touch the flat part of the reed,\nwhere the imaginary “dot” at the tip has been all along.  The air and tongue go to\nthis same “dot.”\n6.  Allow students to articulate as fast as they can.\n7.  Allow the students to start the sound and use the \"ta-day\" syllable.\n8.  Allow the students to start the sound and articulate by snapping your finger on\ncommand.\n9.  With the metronome, begin to incorporate easy follow-the-leader rhythms with you\nsinging or modeling – and the students echoing on their mouthpiece and barrel.\nWhole rests may or may not be necessary between you and the students.  As with\nyour initial sound production exercises, students need to continue counting with their\nfingers while they are playing.  This ensures that students are thinking internal\nsubdivision.\n10. Before progressing to the fully-assembled clarinet, assign the following playing test\non the mouthpiece and barrel:\nAttach the mouthpiece and barrel to the clarinet and begin articulation.  Students must be\nconstantly reminded that they should be articulating in the same way as they were when\njust using the mouthpiece and barrel.\nWhether students are playing white notes or black notes, they must constantly be\nreminded that the tongue moves down quickly.\nWhen students can successfully sing note names on the same pitch, allow them to\narticulate multiple notes on the same pitch.\nWhen pulse and foot pat are learned, students articulate every time their foot touches the\nfloor – and then when their foot touches the floor and as it comes up.\nOnce the student is able to read music, call the articulation \"rhythmic articulation\".\nStudents should be tonguing as the music moves across the page.\nDo not allow students to articulate back-to-back notes on different pitches until they are\nplaying with absolute connected style on notes of the same pitch.\nWhen the tongue is moving correctly, you must decide when it is appropriate to have\nstudents begin coordinating finger movement with articulation.\nWhen students articulate back-to-back notes on different pitches, they cannot stop their\nair as they change fingerings.\nTeach Mary Had a Little Lamb in four segments by singing and then playing:\nAfter all students have successfully played each segment of Mary Had a Little Lamb,\nbegin to string together the segments into the following finished product:\nUltimately, students should be able to execute any or all of the following on a daily basis:\no  articulate as fast as they can\no  articulate using the \"ta-day\" syllable\no  articulate on command\no  articulate with foot pat and articulate rhythms\nWhen playing exercises out of the method book, you can return to previously-learned\nlines and add articulation.  Do not feel like all lines must be executed again during class;\nassign students to perform all lines at home with articulation."

    "text": "CLARINET EMBOUCHURE\nStudents must be able to use air correctly before beginning to learn the\nclarinet embouchure.\nUse the mouthpiece and barrel for better control.\nThe teacher should place the mouthpiece in the beginning.\nSome teachers prefer to place the mouthpiece against the upper teeth first; others\nprefer to place the bottom lip first, and then the upper teeth and top lip.  We prefer\nthe latter.\nThe student needs to remember how it feels and sounds.\nOnce the teacher has demonstrated how it feels and sounds, the student can hold\nthe  mouthpiece  and  barrel  in  place  and  watch  his  face  in  a  mirror  to  make  sure\nnothing  moves  or  looks  unnatural.    Then,  the  student  remembers  how  it  looks,\nfeels and sounds.\nIt is best to hold the mouthpiece with two fingers and a thumb at the very bottom\nof the barrel.  The fingers should have absolutely no contact with the mouthpiece\nor ligature.\nThe mouthpiece is held by the teeth, not the lips.\nThe upper teeth rest on the mouthpiece material (patch).\nThe students must get used to having a lifting sensation against their upper teeth.\nUsing  rubber  gloves  (separate  for  each  student),  show  the  student  how  much\npressure they will feel.  Do not allow the student’s head to move at all.\nThe lower teeth feel the reed through the lower lip that covers them.\nThe lower lip covers the lower teeth like a fitted sheet covers a mattress.\nThe back teeth are naturally apart.\nThe tongue is in the “li” position…..slightly up, but not pulled back.\nUsing the index finger, gently push the lower lip toward, but not rolled\nover the lower teeth.  Lick the part that goes over.  That is the correct amount.\nThe bottom teeth should not respond to the placement of the mouthpiece by\nmoving backwards, and may move slightly forward to create a smooth area\nin the chin called the valley.  The student should not feel any tension in his jaw\nas the mouthpiece is placed on his bottom lip.\nThe  corners  are  toward  the  mouthpiece.    Ultimately,  the  corners  will  be  toward\nthe mouthpiece and down.\nThere should be no wrinkles in the lower lip, and red flesh must be seen\non either side of the mouthpiece.\nThe lower lip that is not under the reed stays in front of the teeth.\nNever tell students to pull their lips over their teeth.  Pulling and stretching makes\nlips thicker.\nThe upper lip rests on top of the mouthpiece in front of the upper teeth.\nThe upper lip should be soft and pliable, and follow the shape/contour of the\nmouthpiece.\nBoth the top and bottom lip should always feel soft and natural.\nThere should be no lines or dimples that do not appear in the natural face.  The\nface essentially should be “zombie”-like.\nThe air is directed at the clarinet, not into it.\nThe air is focused to an imaginary dot in the middle of the reed where the flat\npart meets the tip.\nThe teacher can help the student feel how the lip, the lifting and the valley feel.\nEnough mouthpiece must be past the lips into the chamber of the mouth to allow\nthe reed to freely vibrate.\nAs the student focuses the air at the “dot”, an instant vibration should occur.\nThere must be a resonant fifth line treble clef concert F# sounded.\nIf the sound is stuffy, the student may be holding the mouthpiece with the lips.\nIf the sound is strident and brittle, the student may have too much mouthpiece\nin his mouth or may be using too much unfocused air.\nBe sure the student can control the air well enough to find the correct balance of\nair and resistance to create the sound you want on the mouthpiece and barrel.\nRemember that the mouth can be too open; the teeth can be out of position; the\nlips can be too loose and puffy or can grip; the tongue can be too far back in the\nmouth; the student can be lifting too little.  All of these will result in a sound you\nwill not wish to create.\nKeep making subtle adjustments to the angle, amount of mouthpiece taken, etc.\nJust a slight movement can really improve the resonance of the vibration.\nKeep the body and face calm and still while learning this embouchure.\nThe embouchure is a constant work in progress.  Special attention should be given\nto the contact of the upper teeth with the mouthpiece material.  The teacher can\nattempt to move the mouthpiece out of position to make the student aware that\nsomething is incorrect.\nIt is easier to make something firmer than to get rid of unnecessary tightness.\nIf the sound is not clear, instant and resonant on the mouthpiece, the sound on\nthe clarinet will not be resonant and beautiful.\nWhen  the  barrel  is  placed  on  the  clarinet,  the  first  attempt  at  sound  production\nshould be made with the teacher holding the instrument for the student.  This will\nbe demonstrated.\nTrade back and forth with the teacher holding: the student holding: etc."

    "text": "CLARINET THROAT TONES\nOn the clarinet, G, G#, A, and Bb in the staff are generally considered the open throat\ntones for the instrument. This means that when playing these notes, you are plugging very\nfew (if any) holes, and are usually only opening more. The air in the clarinet is going to\ntravel less and with barely any resonance in the clarinet. These notes will typically be\nsharp…..especially when sustained with other instruments sustaining the same pitch.\nPlaying throat tones with the characteristic sound and pitch takes years of practice and\nmuscle training.\nHave the students use very fast air on their open G. They need to try to relax their\nthroat so it is nice and open while not losing the embouchure.  When this is\nachieved, then they can apply this skill to the other three notes.\nIt is important that students’ oral cavity is very “tall.”\nThe teeth need to be apart in the back of the mouth.\nStudents should think of having an egg on the back of their tongue….and if they\nclose off too much, the egg will break.\nVery fast air is required.\nAlternate Fingerings (not to be taught in 6th grade…but these fingerings will\nassist in improving the intonation)\nIf sharp, add finger 6 and right pinky 1 in the right hand\nIf still sharp, add finger 5 in the right hand\nIf still sharp, add finger 4 in the right hand\nIf still sharp, add finger 3 in the left hand\nIf still sharp, add finger 2 in the left hand"

The de-humidifier is detrimental\nto the lifespan and quality of the reed (due\nto the environment).  The de-humidifier can\ncause the reeds to dry out very quickly and\nbecome warped, or cause the moisture to\nlinger and grow mold.\nEach reed slot is already numbered with\ndots.\nTips of the reeds face toward the bottom of\nthe reed case to prevent students from\ndamaging the tips of the reeds.\nHolds 8 - $27.49 @ wwbw.com\nDoes not include a de-humidifier\nTips of the reeds face toward the hinges to\nprevent students from touching the tips of\nthe reeds.\nLa Voz Reed Guard\n$3.69 @wwbw.com\nLa Voz is another type of reed guard that is\nless expensive than Vandoren.\nRecommended for marching band use\nWill need to be numbered with a silver\nsharpie, paint-pen, or stickers\nVandoren Mouthpiece Patches\nPackage of 6: $8.99 @ wwbw.com\nPatches are flat, clear, and inexpensive\nPreferred over the Runyon rubber patches,\nwhich are spongy and add height to the\nmouthpiece\nIdeal for students who have braces or are\ngetting braces\nKeeps teeth from slipping off the\nmouthpiece and does not dampen the\nvibration as much as the Runyon patches\nOver time, teeth marks will appear making\nthe student more aware of how much\nmouthpiece to use.\nRecommended for use in marching band\nRunyon Clarinet Thumb Saver\n$1.95 @ musicarts.com\nPrevents blisters or calluses from forming\non the right thumb\nOther inexpensive options would be\npurchasing surgical tube from a home\nimprovement store or pencil grips from an\noffice supply store\nYamaha Plastic Mouthpiece Cap\n$3.99 @ musicarts.com\nPlastic is absolutely preferred to metal to\nprotect the tip of the mouthpiece and reed.\nMake sure that students playing on an “attic\nhorn” have a mouthpiece cap.\nOne of the following can be chosen when assisting students with proper maintenance regarding corks.\nSelmer Tuning Slide and Cork Grease\n$2.99 @ wwbw.com\nThe Selmer cork grease is a liquid and lasts\nmuch longer than the normal ChapStick-\nstyle grease.\nCaution should be used when using this\nbecause it is very sticky.\nMust be stored in a plastic Ziploc bag as it\nmay explode.\nIf it hits something in the case or if exposed\nto heat, it will damage other maintenance kit\nitems.\nTo apply, squeeze a tiny bit of the grease up\nand down onto the cork. Then, with an\nindex finger, work it into the cork to create\nenough friction to properly lubricate the\ncork.\nWoodwind Cork Grease\n$1.25 @ wwbw.com\nmay explode or melt.\nDo not leave out at home unattended, as\nyounger children may actually use it as\nChapStick.\nTo apply, use a tiny bit of the grease up and\ndown with an index finger and work it into\nthe cork to create enough friction to\nproperly lubricate the cork.\nGEM Swabs Silk Clarinet Swab\n$8.99 @ wwbw.com\nDo not use a cloth swab or a “shove-it”\n(currently called “Pad Guard”), which are\noften found with “attic horns.” Neither of\nthese items will take sufficient moisture out\nof the body of the instrument. They also\ntend to get stuck.\nVery absorbent and features a tapered cut to\nlimit the chance of getting stuck in the\ninstrument\nThe mouthpiece and barrel should be\nremoved from the clarinet before swabbing.\nThe clarinet must be held upside-down so\nthe swab can be dropped through the bell\nand through the bottom of the upper joint\nwith slight tugs. When holding the clarinet,\none hand must be at the bottom of the upper\njoint. Do not yank or pull the swab from\nside-to-side, but rather up and down.\nPulling the swab too forcefully or quickly\nmay result in the swab getting stuck or torn\nby the register flu inside the upper joint of\nthe clarinet.\nWrap the swab around an index finger to\nclean the receivers of the barrel and\nmouthpiece, as well as the tip of the\nmouthpiece.\nHand wash the swab with dish soap or\nWoolite and warm water.\n8x10 Plexiglass\nBinswangerglass.com\nPrices vary depending on where mirrors are\npurchased.\nMirrors purchased through Binswanger can\nbe purchased in bulk and cut to a desired\nsize. They will also be made of plexiglass.\nPurchasing mirrors at a home improvement\nstore is also an option; however, mirrors\nwill have to be individually cut by a band\nparent or yourself.\nNo matter where mirrors are purchased,   it\nis vital that they are made of plexiglass and\nnot glass. Plexiglass ensures that students\nwill not accidentally hurt themselves or\nshatter when dropped.\nTo receive a better price, attempt to find\nother band directors who would be willing\nto place an order as well. Assuring the\ncompany that you will place annual orders\nmay also result in a discount.\nSelf-portrait mirrors from art supply stores\nare acceptable.\nCar clip-on mirrors are not recommended\nbecause they are too small and the hinges\nbreak easily.\nMakeup mirrors are not recommended\nbecause they are too small and oddly\nshaped.\nIt would be best if there was a box for the\nmirrors in each separate class location.\nStudents can then easily obtain a mirror out\nof the box before class and return the mirror\nafter class."

    "text": "CLARINET CASES, IDENTIFICATION OF\nPARTS AND REMOVING IT FROM ITS CASE\nGeneral Information About All Woodwind Instrument Cases\nMost cases have distinguishing marks somewhere on the case.\nIdentify these marks, and their relationship to the top and bottom of\nthe case. Most cases have the handles placed on the bottom section\nof each case.  Check to make sure.\nPlace all cases on the floor in front of the student, or on a large table in the\ncorrect position.  Clarinet cases are more easily opened from the top of a large\ntable.\nBe sure the student understands where each part of the instrument belongs in\nthe case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make\nsure the student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure\nthe parts of the instruments are returned to the case in the reverse order they\nwere removed.\nAll instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure\nexplicitly every time.\nNever leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up,\nbut this is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.\nCheck each opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to\nyour students.\nCases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom\nsetup for each student’s case.\nIdentifying Parts of the Clarinet and Removing It Safely From Its Case\nOnce the case information is understood, place the case on a flat surface.\nNever let the student place the case in his lap.\nOpen the case from its correct position.  Remember, most latches will lift up.\nAs you begin to teach the clarinet, give only the upper and lower joint to the\nstudents.  Place the other parts in a plastic bag with the student’s name on it,\nand place it in a locked cabinet in your office.\nThe previous procedure is easy to “sell” to the student.  Tell him as soon as he\nproves he can take care of the parts he has, he can be given another part to his\ninstrument.\nTo sell this concept to the parents, explain the money factor.  It is almost as\nexpensive to replace one broken item as it is to buy an entire instrument.\nIdentify the lower joint:  this joint has a thumb rest on the bottom side and three\nsilver rings on the upper.\nIdentify the upper joint:  the register key is on the bottom, but call it the “long,\nskinny” key or the “exclamation point” key.  They will remember this\ndescription more easily in the beginning.  It also has only two silver rings on\nthe top.\nSEND SEGMENTS OF THIS INFORMATION HOME TO PARENTS.\nCHOOSE THE INFORMATION YOU THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL\nFOR HOME PRACTICE AND INSTRUMENT CARE.\nLook at the case in relation to the parts of the clarinet.  Most cases are molded\nto the shape of a particular part.  Be specific when making this point to your\nstudents.  Take your time, and repeat the information many times.  Notice that\nall silver rings are toward the ceiling when placed correctly in the case.\nDamage will occur if the parts are placed incorrectly in the case.\nCorks on a new beginner instrument are usually really fat.  The parts will not\neasily fit together.  Only someone with experience should carefully sand the\ncorks to the proper size.  Use a very fine sand paper (400).  Be very careful.\nTake off a very small amount and test many times until you have the correct fit\nthat can easily be controlled by a small child.\nAfter sanding, apply the correct amount of cork grease for the student the first\ntime.  Even if the student understands how little is needed, you still must watch\nthem apply the cork grease several times before you trust them to do the job\nalone.  Never let the student have his own tube of cork grease in the beginning\nof the learning process.  After he has proven his competence, he may have the\ntube.  If the cork looks dull, or the joints are difficult to put together, a small\namount of cork grease may be needed.  Teach him to ask you first before\napplying.  Once you know he has made the correct analysis, the student may\nmake his own decisions.  Cork grease can mess up the inside of the case if the\ntube is not completely closed, and can even damage the key mechanism if it\ncomes in contact with the wood or metal.\nThe barrel of the clarinet will look like a barrel, and will have a large end and a\nsmall end.  The large end is placed on the upper joint, and the mouthpiece (to\nbe identified later) is placed into the small end.\nThe bell looks like a bell and is placed on the lower joint.\nThe mouthpiece has a thin end and a fat end.  The top is curved, and the bottom\n(table) is flat.  The importance of these features will be explained later.  The\nmouthpiece will also have a very fat cork that will need the same attention as\nthe other corks on the body of the instrument.\nThe ligature is usually metal for the beginning instrument.  Depending on the\nbrand name, the screws will be placed on the upper, curved part-or on the flat\nbottom part-of the mouthpiece.  In either case, the screws for the ligature will\nalways appear on the right side of the mouthpiece as the student looks at the\nmouthpiece from the flat side.  Screws for ligatures will never appear on the\nleft side of the mouthpiece.  The ligature has a large end and a small end.\nThe reed is basically the same shape as the mouthpiece.  It has a thin end and a\nfat end…..a flat side and a curved side.\nThe reed/mouthpiece cap (protector) should be made of plastic for the\nbeginning instrument.  If metal protectors are used, be aware that they will\nmost likely scratch the mouthpiece and perhaps damage the tip of the reed.\nUsing a plastic protector will result in fewer broken reeds.\nThe table (flat part) of the mouthpiece may not necessarily be exactly flat.  To\nfix this, use the finest sandpaper (400).  Place the sandpaper on a piece of glass.\nRub the table of the mouthpiece on the combined surface of sandpaper and\nglass.  Check often to see if the mouthpiece does not “rock” when placed\nagainst the plate glass.\nPeriodically have mouthpiece checks.  Check for chips on rails and on the tip.\nAlso check for chips on the inside of the tip.  Give written work to your\nstudents while you check each mouthpiece carefully.  A chipped mouthpiece\ncan be devastating to a beginning clarinet student’s embouchure development.\nHave frequent reed checks.  Do not allow your students to use chipped or dirty\nreeds.  Reserve the right to break a reed at any time in the most professional\nmanner possible.  Make sure the parents understand the reason for this action.\nThis is why we suggest you start with Mitchell Lurie or Rico (cheap) reeds for\nthe first few weeks.  After students learn to take care of their reeds, more\nexpensive reeds can be used successfully.  Reeds will warp.  A demonstration\nwill be given of how to moisten and “straighten” a reed that has warped.  Using\na reed guard will help keep reeds from warping so badly.\nAll students should have a reed guard, and all reeds should be placed in the\nguard at all times. Four-slotted reed guards are recommended.  Students should\neither number or “letter” each slot.  Each time a student plays his clarinet, a\ndifferent reed should be used in rotation.\nConsider using an old or unused DRY reed to be placed on the mouthpiece at\nthe end of each playing session, whether it is at school or at home.  This will\nallow the ligature to always remain in the shape it is in when the student is\n“playing” the clarinet.\nStudents should have a lint-free cloth in their cases.  It can be used in various\nways such are wiping moisture off keys, etc. after use.  No music, folders, or\nunnecessary objects may be placed in the case at any time.  Only the parts of\nthe clarinet should be allowed in the case.\nThe use of the swab must be carefully explained, and a quality silk swab should\nbe included in the cost of the maintenance kit.  Even more importantly, the\nstudent should be given CLASS TIME to clean out his instrument, and store\nhis reed and instrument properly in the case.  Always leave the ligature on the\nmouthpiece with a dry reed replacing the “class reed.”  This will prevent\ndamage, and allow the ligature to form and bond more correctly with the\nmouthpiece.  DRY REEDS MUST BE USED FOR THIS PURPOSE.  A\n“USED/WET” REED WILL RESULT IN MOLD OR MILDEW\nFORMING ON THE REED, IN THE MOUTHPIECE AND THE CASE."

    "text": "CLARINET ASSEMBLY AND\nINSTRUMENT/BODY RATIO\nBE VERY SPECIFIC!!\nThe student’s hands must be touching the part of the clarinet he is assembling at\nall times.  Be sure one hand is holding while the other is sliding up and down the\nbody of the clarinet as the bell, barrel and mouthpiece are added.\n1.  Before removing the parts of the clarinet, put the reed in the mouth to\nmoisten and smooth the top and bottom of it.\n2.  Pick up the upper joint.  Use the right hand, and lay it in your left hand.\nThe palm of the left hand is toward the ceiling.  The long skinny key goes\naway from the body and toward the floor.  Cross the thumb and forefinger\nof the left hand, and “lock” them over the silver ring.\n3.  Pick up the lower joint with the right hand between the pancake keys.  The\npalm of the right hand should be toward the floor and the thumb rest\nshould also point to the floor.  Lock the thumb and forefinger of the right\nhand around the joint.\n4.  Sit down in a chair.\n5.  Place the lower joint on your right leg.\n6.  Place the middle finger of the left hand over the covered key between the\nsilver rings and press down.  This will lift the bridge key.\n7.  The student cannot place two tenons or two receivers together.  The tenon\non the upper joint fits into the receiver of the lower joint.  Make sure that\nthe lower joint is straight up and down on the right leg.  Place the tenon\ninto the receiver in a perpendicular position.  Any angle could result in\ndamage to the tenon.  Push and twist in opposite directions.  Assist\nstudents who are not strong enough to accomplish this task.\n8.  Check to see if the keys are in line and facing the student.  Run the index\nfinger of the left hand down the silver rings to make sure they line up.\nAfter the student is comfortable with this assembly process:\n1.  Hold the connected upper and lower joint with the left hand and pick up\nthe bell with the right hand.\n2.  Place the bell on the right knee.\n3.  Slide the left hand down to the lower joint.  Place the bell and lower joint\ntogether; twist and push.\n4.  Carefully lay the clarinet on the lap or the floor.\n5.  Pick up the barrel with the right hand, and the mouthpiece (without the\nligature) with the left hand.\n6.  When assembling the mouthpiece and barrel, students should use slight\ntwisting motions.\n7.  Place the large end of the ligature over the mouthpiece carefully.  Make\nsure the screws are on the right as you look at them from the table of the\nmouthpiece.\n8.  Lift the ligature slightly with the thumb and forefinger of a chosen hand,\nand carefully slide the reed onto the table of the mouthpiece.  The reed is\nplaced fat to fat, flat to flat and thin to thin.\n9.  The edges of the reed should be aligned along the rails/sides of the table of\nthe mouthpiece.\n10. A tiny bit of black should be seen when looking directly toward the tip of\nthe mouthpiece in relation to the tip of the reed.\n11. The ligature should cover at least one of the two lines that appear on most\nquality mouthpieces.\n12. Tighten the bottom screw snuggly, and the top screw to its first point of\nresistance.\n13. Pick up the already assembled body of the clarinet with the left hand and\nslide the hand to the top of the upper joint.  Using the right hand, twist and\npush the assembled mouthpiece and barrel to the clarinet.  Make sure the\ntable of the mouthpiece is in line with the long skinny key.\nTake the instrument apart in the exact opposite manner keeping your hands on the\npieces you are removing.  Slide from piece to piece, and twist and pull apart.  The\nreed must be blotted and placed in the reed guard.  The moisture on the inside of\nthe mouthpiece must be carefully removed.  The ligature must be left on the\nmouthpiece with a dry reed and a plastic protector.  Place the parts in the case in\ntheir proper compartments.  Be sure the silver rings are facing upward.  Close and\nlock the case.\nInstrument/Body Ratio\nFamiliarize the student with the instrument/body ratio by using only the upper and\nlower joints.\nThe left hand should gently hold the upper joint in the same manner used to\nassemble the instrument--without putting pressure on the long keys.\nThe right hand should hold the lower joint in the same manner used to assemble\nthe instrument--without putting pressure on the long keys.\nMove the instrument up and down, side to side by using the elbows.  All aspects\nof the brass instrument information hold true here.  The body playing position\nalso holds true from previous information.  We are merely getting used to the\nweight of the instrument; the position of the instrument; and the angle of the\ninstrument without using correct hand position.  The student should not squeeze\nthe instrument as these exercises are practiced.  Keep the palms of the hands soft.\nFamiliarize the student in this manner for a few days before placing the fingers in\ntheir correct position."

    "text": "TRUMPET FLEXIBILITY AND\nRANGE EXTENSION\n•  Brass playing is based upon flexibility.\n•  Students eventually need to be flexible through each of the harmonic series in\norder to move up and down within the range of the instrument.\n•  Once the student can reproduce at will a given pitch, the teacher must decide\nwhether flexibility up or down is needed first.\n•  Flexibility is controlled by air direction and the isometrics created by the corners\nand canine/eye teeth.  The head must always stay in its natural, balanced position\nat all times.  The angle of the instrument must not change at any time.\n•  Students must learn to angle the air in the cup of the mouthpiece without changing\nthe position of the lips and/or the relationship of the upper and lower teeth.\n•  Flexibility is also enhanced by vowel sounds used in various registers.  These\nsounds can be “ah” for the middle register….”ee” for the upper register….and\n“oh” for the lower register.  Have students practice saying these vowel sounds\nwith vocalization on appropriate lower, middle and higher sounds.\n•  Bring to the students’ attention that the shape of the tongue changes dramatically\nfrom vowel sound to vowel sound.  All students should be aware that vowel\nsounds are the middles of words that they speak every day.  Practice saying words\nthat use the required vowel sounds. (i.e.  bow, ball, beep)\n•  Range is developed through flexibility.  It is more important to create a resonant\nsound while practicing flexibility than to create wider intervals.  The student can\nenhance their range by making more resonant sounds in the middle register before\ntrying to extend higher or lower.\n•  Make sure students understand the texture of the lips have nothing to do with\nrange.  For example, students should never be told to “tighten” their lips in order\nto play in the higher register."

    "text": "TRUMPET ARTICULATION\n•  The tongue moves in the same manner when articulating a brass instrument as it\ndoes  when  you  speak.    The  tongue  moves  up  and  down—not  back  and  forth—\nboth when speaking and when articulation on an instrument.\n•  The purpose of the tongue is to release the air which causes the lips to vibrate and\ncreates  the  sound.    The  tongue’s  release  of  the  air  simply  defines  the\nbeginning/start of the vibration/sound.\n•  Articulation  is  used  to  define  the  vibrations  necessary  to  create  musical  rhythm,\nstyle  and  movement--to  contrast  the  use  of  slurring  (which  also  creates  similar\nmusical entities).\n•  The students should think that the tongue “articulates” the sound created by the\nairstream.  If the student is taught to create the sound correctly, articulation will\nbe an easy transition.\na.  sound occurs when the air moves past the naturally vibrating lips\nb.  articulate the sound that is already present\nc.  teach students to articulate at the moment the sound begins\n•  Without the instrument or mouthpiece, use the following procedure:\n1.   Say the word “DOG”.\n2.  Sing the syllable “DAH”.\n3.  Once these are mastered, have the student use the mouthpiece and\ninstrument and reproduce the “DAH” syllable in their brain to create\nan articulated sound.\n4.  The tongue should feel the same when saying, singing and playing the\nmouthpiece and instrument.\n5.  The tongue should touch the enamel of the upper teeth directly below\nthe gum line—in the same spot with the same strength every time.\n6.  Use the syllable “DAH” because it creates smoother and more easily\ncontrolled air as opposed to the “TAH” syllable.\n7.

The students should remember that the mouthpiece “gathers” the air—\nnot the lips.\n6.  There must never be more energy placed against the upper lip than the\nlower lip; hence the instrument will angle slightly downwards.\nTRUMPET ARTICULATION\n•  The tongue moves in the same manner when articulating a brass instrument as it\ndoes  when  you  speak.    The  tongue  moves  up  and  down—not  back  and  forth—\nboth when speaking and when articulation on an instrument.\n•  The purpose of the tongue is to release the air which causes the lips to vibrate and\ncreates  the  sound.    The  tongue’s  release  of  the  air  simply  defines  the\nbeginning/start of the vibration/sound.\n•  Articulation  is  used  to  define  the  vibrations  necessary  to  create  musical  rhythm,\nstyle  and  movement--to  contrast  the  use  of  slurring  (which  also  creates  similar\nmusical entities).\n•  The students should think that the tongue “articulates” the sound created by the\nairstream.  If the student is taught to create the sound correctly, articulation will\nbe an easy transition.\na.  sound occurs when the air moves past the naturally vibrating lips\nb.  articulate the sound that is already present\nc.  teach students to articulate at the moment the sound begins\n•  Without the instrument or mouthpiece, use the following procedure:\n1.   Say the word “DOG”.\n2.  Sing the syllable “DAH”.\n3.  Once these are mastered, have the student use the mouthpiece and\ninstrument and reproduce the “DAH” syllable in their brain to create\nan articulated sound.\n4.  The tongue should feel the same when saying, singing and playing the\nmouthpiece and instrument.\n5.  The tongue should touch the enamel of the upper teeth directly below\nthe gum line—in the same spot with the same strength every time.\n6.  Use the syllable “DAH” because it creates smoother and more easily\ncontrolled air as opposed to the “TAH” syllable.\n7.  After each “articulation”, the tongue must immediately fall down into\nits natural “at rest” position.\n8.  The tongue will be naturally soft at all times, but can touch the teeth\nwith different strengths.\n9.  The tongue will be in its “down position” 98% of the time when\narticulating correctly.\n•  Have the student start their sound with the air.\n•  Using the information about the basics of articulation, have the student articulate\nas fast as they can with no limitations of numbers, worries about evenness of\narticulation, etc.  Simply get them used to articulating!\n•  Have the student then use the “ta-day” syllable to practice using the tongue in an\norganized manner.\n•  Have the student then articulate “on command.”  The student will start their\nsound, and articulate when you snap your fingers to practice gaining more control\nof the tongue.\n•  Once the student understands pulse and the foot pat, have the student articulate\nexactly when the toe of the foot touches the floor.\n•  Have the student articulate with the down and up position of the foot.\n•  Proceed to written rhythms as they begin to read music.\nAlways practice this entire routine.  The student must always go through the\nentire process, so he will not lose the ability to move his tongue at various speeds\nand in astructured manners.\nTRUMPET FLEXIBILITY AND\nRANGE EXTENSION\n•  Brass playing is based upon flexibility.\n•  Students eventually need to be flexible through each of the harmonic series in\norder to move up and down within the range of the instrument.\n•  Once the student can reproduce at will a given pitch, the teacher must decide\nwhether flexibility up or down is needed first.\n•  Flexibility is controlled by air direction and the isometrics created by the corners\nand canine/eye teeth.  The head must always stay in its natural, balanced position\nat all times.  The angle of the instrument must not change at any time.\n•  Students must learn to angle the air in the cup of the mouthpiece without changing\nthe position of the lips and/or the relationship of the upper and lower teeth.\n•  Flexibility is also enhanced by vowel sounds used in various registers.  These\nsounds can be “ah” for the middle register….”ee” for the upper register….and\n“oh” for the lower register.  Have students practice saying these vowel sounds\nwith vocalization on appropriate lower, middle and higher sounds.\n•  Bring to the students’ attention that the shape of the tongue changes dramatically\nfrom vowel sound to vowel sound.  All students should be aware that vowel\nsounds are the middles of words that they speak every day.  Practice saying words\nthat use the required vowel sounds. (i.e.  bow, ball, beep)\n•  Range is developed through flexibility.  It is more important to create a resonant\nsound while practicing flexibility than to create wider intervals.  The student can\nenhance their range by making more resonant sounds in the middle register before\ntrying to extend higher or lower.\n•  Make sure students understand the texture of the lips have nothing to do with\nrange.  For example, students should never be told to “tighten” their lips in order\nto play in the higher register.\nCORNET CLASS WARM-UP SHEET\n1\n(cid:5) (cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:84)\n(cid:5) (cid:84)\n2\n(cid:5)\n3\n(cid:84)\n(cid:5) (cid:199)\n(cid:5) (cid:199)(cid:64)\n4\n(cid:5) (cid:157)\n(cid:199)\n(cid:157)\n(cid:199)(cid:64)\n(cid:5) (cid:157)(cid:64)\n5\n(cid:157)(cid:64)\n(cid:84)(cid:64)\n(cid:135)\nCORNET CHROMATIC WARM-UP\nDESCENDING/ASCENDING\nÓ\n˙n\n˙b\n˙#\n˙\n∑\n& 44 ˙\n& ˙\n& ˙b\n&\n& ˙#\nCORNET EXTENDED SLURS\n& 4\nœ\n& 44 œ\nœ œ œ œ œ œ œ œ\nœb\n& 44 œ œ œ œ œ œ œ œ\nw\n& œ\nCORNET CHRISTMAS TUNES\nJingle Bells\nGood King Wenceslas (lower)\n4 œ\nGood King Wenceslas (higher)"

The right hand will be cupped on the outer ridge of the bottom of the bell.  Both\nhands hold and balance the French horn in the beginning.  The horn does not rest on\nthe leg.  The right hand is not placed inside the bell until the teacher determines that\nthe student can balance the horn in this manner.  An added bonus to holding the\nFrench horn by the bottom of the bell will result in the student being able to hear—\nand expect to hear—a more resonant sound when the hand is finally in its\ncorrect/more advanced position inside the bell.\n8.  Though not a part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling\nthe instrument toward the student’s face.  Instruct students to keep their elbows soft\nwhile playing the French horn.\n9.  The palms of both hands should feel soft.\n10. The teacher must watch young students closely to monitor that their shoulders stay\nbalanced and feel naturally soft at all times.\n•  Although single F horns are lighter and easier for students to control in the\nbeginning stages of playing, it is suggested that beginning French horn students\nare started on double horns. Of course, this decision may be dictated by what\ninstruments are available in your inventory."

The placement for each note can vary.  Tuning just one\nnote will not give you an accurate slide setting.\n3.  Slide settings do matter, but not as much as playing fundamentals.  If a student is\nvibrating the wrong note on the mouthpiece, the sound can be incorrect in a\nnumber of different ways.\nCommon Mistakes in French horn Tuning\nInaccurate or inconsistent hand placement\nInaccurate or inconsistent slide placement\n•\n•  Pulling the wrong slide\n•  Pulling a slide for the wrong reason\n•  Wrong ratio of tuning slides to one another\nWill the correct slide please stand up…?\n•  There are three kinds of tuning slides on horn:\no  F side\no  Bb side\no  Combination or main slide.\n•  The top stack of valve slides is the F side; the bottom stack is the Bb side.  Single\nsided horns only have one stack.\n•  The water slide on the front and closest to the player is an imposter.

Then make sure they vibrate on pitch.\n•  At first, all slides should be out ¼ inch (except the wannabe water slide).  French\nhorns are made to be in tune with the slides out.\n•  Later, slides can be individually adjusted.\n•  Tuning slides should be out the same distance as each other.\nPopular Models and Their Slides\nHolton 179\n•  Main slide on the top but in the back (with it on your lap)\n•  Bb slide sideways in front\n•  F Bottom on back\n•  Front vertical is a fake tuning slide.

If you get a note with\nthe trigger down, and then an open note, the slide is a main slide--that is it adjusts both\nsides of the horn.  If you get noise with the trigger, but a note on the open horn- it is an F\nslide and adjusts notes without the trigger.  Conversely, if you get a note on the open horn\nbut noise on the trigger side, it adjusts the length of the Bb horn.\nLove your Rotary Valves and they will love you back…\n•  With a Holton French horn, you will have to beat them with a chime mallet.\n•  Oil all the moving parts.  Oil is like most wonderful things…you cannot have too\nmuch!\n•  Oil the springs, under the valve cap, and INSIDE the slides to keep it from mixing\nwith slide grease and slowing down the valve.  Then move the slide in and out\nand then pop the valve.  The suction sound you hear, while bad for the valve seals\nnormally, is pulling the oil into the valve.

Move the instrument up and down, side to side, higher than usual\nand lower than usual.  As students are doing this, have them notice how it affects the\nbalance of the body.  Eventually, the body should feel as balanced with or without the\ninstrument in hand.\nHand Position\n1.  The most natural shape of everyone’s hands forms a “flat-C.”\n2.  All hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall behind the\nwrist.\n3.  There should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the French horn.\n4.  The inside of the arm must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding\nthe French horn correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\n5.  Elbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be\nhampered.\n6.  Place both the left and the right hand in their correct “beginner” position.  The left\nhand is placed on the valves and will lie in the “flat-C” position.  No tension should\nbe felt in this hand, as the fingers move “with” the valves.\n7.  The right hand will be cupped on the outer ridge of the bottom of the bell.  Both\nhands hold and balance the French horn in the beginning.  The horn does not rest on\nthe leg.  The right hand is not placed inside the bell until the teacher determines that\nthe student can balance the horn in this manner.  An added bonus to holding the\nFrench horn by the bottom of the bell will result in the student being able to hear—\nand expect to hear—a more resonant sound when the hand is finally in its\ncorrect/more advanced position inside the bell.\n8.  Though not a part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling\nthe instrument toward the student’s face.  Instruct students to keep their elbows soft\nwhile playing the French horn.\n9.  The palms of both hands should feel soft.\n10. The teacher must watch young students closely to monitor that their shoulders stay\nbalanced and feel naturally soft at all times.\n•  Although single F horns are lighter and easier for students to control in the\nbeginning stages of playing, it is suggested that beginning French horn students\nare started on double horns. Of course, this decision may be dictated by what\ninstruments are available in your inventory.\nFRENCH HORN FACE/EMBOUCHURE\n•  Each student should use their own “safe/unbreakable” mirror—both in the\n•\nclassroom and at home.\nUsing the mirror, have each student notice how natural their face looks.  They\nwill have to later remember and memorize how it looks and feels.\n•  The head must be balanced on the shoulders in a comfortable position—not too\nfar forward and not too far backward.\n•  The eyes should be soft and natural, and the “sight line” should be exactly level.\nThe distance between eyebrows should not change as air goes in and out of the\nbody.\n•  Look for natural creases in the face, and allow any that are naturally present to\nexist while playing.  No other creases are allowed.\n•  The corners should move in toward the canine/eye teeth.  The corners should\nnever look or feel pulled back.\n•  The corners can move down from the natural position as the student progresses\nbut they can never move up.\n•  The texture of both the upper and lower lip should be very soft and relaxed.\n•  There should be natural space between the inside of the lips and the gums and\nteeth.  This space should not change or feel different when the lips vibrate inside\nthe cup of the mouthpiece.  Please remember the demonstration given in today’s\npresentation.\n•  The back teeth are slightly apart and should feel the same as when the student is\nreading, watching television, etc.  The teeth should not be pressed into each other\nwhen doing these other activities.\n•  Brass instrument embouchures are formed with a natural overbite.  A student with\nan underbite should be steered away from brass instrument.\n•  The thickness of a student’s lips should correspond to the size of the cup of the\nmouthpiece for the chosen instrument.  Students with a very full top or bottom lip\nshould be steered towards low brass instruments rather than French horn.\n•  The bottom of the front of the tongue should lie in the soft tissue area which is\nlocated in the front of the mouth just behind the ridge of the bottom gum.\n•  Remember that when playing the French horn, cheeks will only “puff out” if\nthe air is not freely going into the instrument.\n•  Assuming that the above has been achieved, the embouchure will be formed with\nspecial attention to the following:\n1.  The mouthpiece must be placed in the middle of the mouth—up and\ndown as well as side to side.\n2.  The corners are in their natural position and should be set against the\ncanine/eye teeth.\n3.  The lips must be allowed to freely vibrate in response to the airstream\nrather than made to “buzz” in front of the airstream.\n4.  The lips must feel natural so that air can freely move past them—they\nmust not be pulled back against the teeth or blown away from the teeth\nand gums.\n5.  The students should remember that the mouthpiece “gathers” the air—\nnot the lips.\n6.  There must never be more energy placed against the upper lip than the\nlower lip; hence when playing the French horn, the student will\nslightly turn their head to the left so the leadpipe appears to angle\nslightly downwards from the embouchure.\n7.  Students must be taught to play “down into the French horn” with the\nbell to the side of the body as it was meant to be played—instead of at\nthe mouthpiece with the bell of the horn into the stomach.\nFRENCH HORN ARTICULATION\n•  The tongue moves in the same manner when articulating a brass instrument as it\ndoes when you speak.  The tongue moves up and down—not back and forth—\nboth when speaking and when articulation on an instrument.  The students should\nthink that the tongue “articulates” the sound created by the airstream.  If the\nstudent is taught to create the sound correctly, articulation will be an easy\ntransition.\na.  sound occurs when the air moves past the naturally vibrating lips\nb.  articulate the sound that is already present\nc.  teach students to articulate at the moment the sound begins\n•  Without the instrument or mouthpiece, use the following procedure:\n1.

Once these are mastered, have the student use the mouthpiece and\ninstrument and reproduce the “DAH” syllable in their brain to create\nan articulated sound.\n4.  The tongue should feel the same when saying, singing and playing the\nmouthpiece and instrument.\n5.

The French horn requires a warmer and “darker” airstream than the\ntrumpet.\n•  Have the student start their sound with the air.\n•  Using the information about the basics of articulation, have the student articulate\nas fast as they can with no limitations of numbers, worries about evenness of\narticulation, etc.  Simply get them used to articulating!\n•  Have the student then use the “ta-day” syllable to practice using the tongue in an\norganized manner.\n•  Have the student then articulate “on command.”  The student will start their\nsound, and articulate when you snap your fingers to practice gaining more control\nof the tongue.\n•  Once the student understands pulse and the foot pat, have the student articulate\nexactly when the toe of the foot touches the floor.\n•  Have the student articulate with the down and up position of the foot.roceed to\nwritten rhythms as they begin to read music.\n•  Always practice this entire routine.  The student must always go through the\nentire process, so he will not lose the ability to move his tongue at various\nspeeds and in astructured manners.\nFRENCH HORN FLEXIBILITY AND\nRANGE EXTENSTION\n•  Brass playing is based upon flexibility.\n•  Students eventually need to be flexible through each of the harmonic series in\norder to move up and down within the range of the instrument.\n•  Once the student can reproduce at will a given pitch, the teacher must decide\nwhether flexibility up or down is needed first.\n•  Flexibility is controlled by air direction and the isometrics created by the corners\nand canine/eye teeth.  The head must always stay in its natural, balanced position\nat all times.  The angle of the instrument must not change at any time.\n•  Students must learn to angle the air in the cup of the mouthpiece without changing\nthe position of the lips and/or the relationship of the upper and lower teeth.\n•  Flexibility is also enhanced by vowel sounds used in various registers.  These\nsounds can be “ah” for the middle register….”ee” for the upper register….and\n“oh” for the lower register.  Have students practice saying these vowel sounds\nwith vocalization on appropriate lower, middle and higher sounds.\n•  Bring to the students’ attention that the shape of the tongue changes dramatically\nfrom vowel sound to vowel sound.  All students should be aware that vowel\nsounds are the middles of words that they speak every day.  Practice saying words\nthat use the required vowel sounds. (i.e.  bow, ball, beep)\n•  Range is developed through flexibility.  It is more important to create a resonant\nsound while practicing flexibility than to create wider intervals.  The student can\nenhance their range by making more resonant sounds in the middle register before\ntrying to extend higher or lower.\n•  Make sure students understand the texture of the lips had nothing to do with\nrange.  For example, students should never be told to “tighten” their lips in order\nto play in the higher register.\n•  All basic fundamentals for teaching brass instruments hold true for the French\nhorn.  Remember the harmonics on the French horn are much closer than on the\ntrumpet.  Flexibility is actually easier to achieve on the French horn, but accuracy\nis more difficult.  Do not be too demanding in the very beginning in regards to\naccuracy.\nFRENCH HORN SLIDES\nMain Tuning Slide – The main tuning slide is the first slide on the horn.  It is located on the\nback side of the horn.  This slide affects the pitch of both sides of the horn (F and B-flat).\nF Tuning Slide – Double horns will have an additional slide on the back of the horn, the F\nTuning Slide that only affects the F side of the horn (without the trigger).  The main tuning slide\nshould be set first before setting this slide.  On a Kruspe wrap horn (more open wrap) the main\ntuning slide and F tuning slide will face in opposite directions.  On a Geyer wrap horn (tighter\nwrap = brighter sound) these slides will face the same direction. (see pictures below)\nExamples of Kruspe wrap horns: Conn 8D, Yamaha 668, Yamaha 668II, Conn 6D, Holton 179\nExample of a Geyer wrap horn: Yamaha 667\n“Fake” Tuning Slide – Many horns will have a fake tuning slide located on the front side of the\nhorn, near the mouthpiece.  This slide is used to empty water that collects in the horn, not for\ntuning.  This is the only slide on the horn that should be pushed in all the way.\nB-flat Tuning Slide – Some horns will also have a B-flat Tuning Slide, that only affects the\npitch of the B-flat side of the horn (with the trigger).  This is a short slide that is located on the\nfront of the horn, in line with the valve slides.  It should be pulled about ¼ of an inch and then\nleft alone.

The F side valve slides are located in front,\nand the B-flat valve slides are the smaller ones located behind.  The valve slides should be set\napproximately equidistant with each other.  The F side slides should be pulled about ¼-3/8 of an\ninch.  The B-flat side slides should be pushed in slightly more than the F side slides because it is\na shorter horn.  The 1st and 2nd valve slides can be pulled out very slightly more to help\ncompensate for the sharp 1-2 valve combination, and the 3rd valve can be pushed in very slightly\nmore to help compensate for the flat 2-3 valve combination.\nKruspe\nMain Tuning Slide\nGeyer\nF Tuning Slide\nFake Tuning Slide\nYamaha 668\nB-flat\nTuning\nSlide\nFake\nYamaha 668II\nHolton 179\nYamaha 667\nTrigger\nvalve casing\nis located on\nthe far end of\nhorn.

Make sure that your students routinely\ndepress the keys when dumping their slides.\nFRENCH HORN TUNING\n1.  You must know what kind of horn the student is playing because the number of\ntuning slides varies.\n2.  Do not tune just one note.  The placement for each note can vary.  Tuning just one\nnote will not give you an accurate slide setting.\n3.  Slide settings do matter, but not as much as playing fundamentals.  If a student is\nvibrating the wrong note on the mouthpiece, the sound can be incorrect in a\nnumber of different ways.\nCommon Mistakes in French horn Tuning\nInaccurate or inconsistent hand placement\nInaccurate or inconsistent slide placement\n•  Pulling the wrong slide\n•  Pulling a slide for the wrong reason\n•  Wrong ratio of tuning slides to one another\nWill the correct slide please stand up…?\n•  There are three kinds of tuning slides on horn:\no  F side\no  Bb side\no  Combination or main slide.\n•  The top stack of valve slides is the F side; the bottom stack is the Bb side.  Single\nsided horns only have one stack.\n•  The water slide on the front and closest to the player is an imposter.  It should be in\nall the time.\n•  All tuning slides should be pulled about the same amount and be in ratio with each\nother.\nHOLTON FARKAS H179\n•  One imposter water slide on the front top\n•  One Bb slide on the front sideways with a ring\n•  One main slide on the back top\n•  One F slide on the back bottom\n•  Valve slides should all be pulled about ¼ of an inch (every single one)\nCONN 8D\nYAMAHA 667\n•  Bb and F slides side by side on the back\nOther brands:\nTake out the slide in question. Play a note without the trigger.  If you hear a note rather\nthan a mystery sound, the F side does not use that tuning slide.  Play a note with the\ntrigger. If you hear a note rather than a mystery sound, the Bb side does not use that\ntuning slide.\nThe C Major Scale: Tuning the Horn from Middle C to 5th line F\nTuning the F Side (no trigger)\n•  Have the student play the first five notes from first ledger line below the staff C to\nsecond line G.  Eye ball the entire part of the scale.  This tunes the F side of the\nhorn.  Set the tuner to first line E and second line G.  All concert F’s (C’s) are\nsharp on the horn.  If F and D are not in tune, adjust the top 1st valve slide.\nTuning the Bb side (trigger)\n•  Have the student play second line G to third space C.  This tunes the Bb (trigger)\nside of the horn.  You are really looking at the third space C.  (If C and G are in\ntune but A and B are out of tune, adjust the second valve slide.)\n•  Have the student play third space C to fifth line F.  Eye ball the entire part of the\nscale.  You are really looking at the C and the F.  (If the D and E are out of tune,\nadjust the bottom first or second valve slide.)\nRemember: Valve slides should all be pulled out equally."

    "text": "FLUTE FLEXIBILITY\nThe embouchure must be flexible so your students can change registers easily,\nplay with a consistent sound from top to bottom, and play with correct intonation\nin the upper register.\nAperture shapes:\nWhen playing in the low register, the aperture is oval or cigar shaped.\nWhen playing in the middle register, the aperture is oval or cigar shaped but\nsmaller.\nWhen playing in the upper register, the aperture shape is smaller and round.\nChanging registers:  The jaw and corners literally come forward.  The aperture\nshape will resemble the shape when whistling.  Use more top lip when playing in\nthe lower register to aim the air down.  When starting in the lower register, the air\nspeed should be very fast and should move forward.  In general, the air should\ncome more forward the higher the student plays.\nPractice flexibility going from low to high before high to low.\nFlexibility Exercises\nUsing just the headjoint, have students cover the open end with their right hand.\nPlay the low sound…then slide to the high sound.  Play low sound……high\nsound……low sound.\nMeter this activity.\nAdd the metronome to this activity when students have met your expectations.\nWhen playing the octave at the end of each measure, students will need to use a\nlot of focused air because the change happens quickly.  This is especially true in\nthe last measure of the exercise.  The descending notes must move quickly so the\nstudents will have enough air in reserve to execute the octave in each capsule.\nAs students progress, another octave can be added to the end of each capsule.\nOctave Slurs—refer to Set 3/Octave Slurs\nAdvanced students can use the harmonics in Set 5 to develop more flexibility and\nstrength.  This should be taught in small groups and is very dangerous when\npresented in a large class setting.  Embouchures can easily become tight if careful\nmonitoring is not observed.\nCreating a Resonant Upper Register\nThe corners and jaw come forward.\nThe bottom lip may turn out or come forward in order to blow more across the\nembouchure hole.\nThere should be more air behind the lips.  The cheeks inflate more and more as\nyou ascend.\nThe teeth need to stay apart, because they tend to close.\nLet the jaw be open—do not force it.\nThe tongue should stay forward and soft.  It must not arch.  If young students tend\nto play above center, their tongue may be pulled back into their throat or their\nembouchure may be too tight.  These problems will result in students playing with\nshrill and harsh sounds.\nThe corners of the mouth and lips should remain soft.\nCreating a Resonant Lower Register\nStudents should never be allowed to pull their corners back into a smile.  The lips\nshould never be stretched against the canine/vampire teeth.\nThe lower register will be very difficult to produce if the headjoint is placed too\nhigh on the lower lip.\nShape with the top lip to project a more focused and resonant sound."

    "text": "MAKING THE FIRST FLUTE HEADJOINT SOUND\nInitial sound production cannot be introduced until correct posture and breathing\nhas been successfully taught.  Include these two essential components as “part” of\nthe first sound attempt(s).\nRelax position and ready position should already be taught and drilled prior to\nsound production.  As sound production is occurring, playing position must be\nincorporated.  Students need to understand that ready position means they are\nready to play.  Playing position means that they are set (physically) to play.\nStudents should not be allowed to sit in relax position during class, except maybe\nduring announcements, paperwork or things not pertaining to playing.  If one\nword instructions are preferred, then use “ready” and “set.”\nTry to get every student to make a sound on the first day of sound production.  If\nyou will not be able to accomplish this, make a disclaimer before you start.  The\nstudents who do not end up getting to make their first sound—on the first day—\nwill be the first students you will start with on the second day!  Students should\nnot be surprised or frustrated if you do not get to them on this first day.\nOn day one of sound production, make another disclaimer if you suspect that you\nwill not get far enough along to allow any of the students to take home their “set-\nup”.\nAt the end of each class, you must make the decision to allow just those who you\nassisted to take home their set-up…….or not allow set-ups to go home until\neveryone has made sounds with your assistance (day one, day two, etc.).\nOnce you allow and require set-ups to go home on a daily basis, students should\nbe recording their practice time on whatever form of practice card you are using.\nBe realistic when designating ____ minutes to be spent on their set-up sounds\nduring their home practice.\nDo not use a metronome when assisting students to make their first sounds.  A\nmetronome should not be added until the class is at the point of making group\nsounds.\nRemind students that lipstick, Chapstick, etc. cannot be worn during class.\nStudents need to understand that their lip plates will not last long, and they will\nbegin to see erosion, rust.  \nWhen working one-on-one with students in your beginning class, it is important\nthat the students are ready as soon as the teacher reaches them.  While other\nstudents are waiting, they must either be paying attention to what you are\ndoing…..or working on a music theory worksheet, etc.\nWhile going around the room, students should not be allowed to make sounds on\ntheir set-up—even if they have already been assisted.  They should also not be\nallowed to improperly hold their set-up (i.e. putting a finger in the bottom of their\nheadjoint…..twirling or playing with the set-up in general……etc.)\nThe instructor must place all headjoints for students.  This may continue for\n2-5 days (if not longer), depending on the size and overall ability level of your\nclass.\nYou should be directly in front of each individual student when assisting them,\nand not to the side. It would be most effective if students were standing and\n“finding their horizon.”  Music stands should be elevated to the proper height,\nand a mirror should be properly positioned on each stand.  You will learn to\nmaneuver around each student’s equipment, etc.  At this point, all cases should be\ndirectly under or to the side of their chairs.\nAs you are working with each student, your goal is to assist each student in\nmaking a quality sound on or in the vicinity of the correct pitch (second space A\nflat or A).  Do not get on to students who do not produce the exact pitch—\nespecially if they are using brands flutes that may be inferior and/or not on your\nrecommended list.  When listening to each student, listen for:\no  quality of sound\no  consistency of sound\no  pitch\nUnless the flute is your primary instrument, you should not be modeling sounds\non the set-up.  As you assist each student, you will eventually find a “star student”\nwho will become the model for future reference.  Be sure to periodically use a\nkeyboard or a metronome—with pitches—so as not to “lose sight” of the correct\npitch (regardless of whether or not a model is used).\nBe aware of fragile and/or teary-eyed students. Move on to the next student in the\ninterest of time, but make an effort to return to these students by the end of class.\nDo not let a student leave class feeling unsuccessful.  If possible, offer a pass for\nstruggling students to come in at lunch or before/after school.\nThe set-up always goes to the student; not the student to the set-up.\nBefore bringing the set-up to the student, check for:\no  proper alignment of the cork in the headjoint\nTrain students not to move their faces or body when you are placing the set-up. It\nmay take certain students multiple tries, and if they move after each attempt, they\n(and you!) basically have to start over each time.\nWhen students breathe, do not allow their corners to pull back at all.\nFurthermore, upper lips should not be pulling up, or back, but instead\npointed/pulled down. If you feel comfortable doing so, you may need to assist the\nstudent by touching area between the bottom of the nose and the upper lip and\nhelp them. If you are uncomfortable, assist them with words and demonstration.\nStudents can breathe through their mouth, but if this causes them to pull back\ntheir corners, ask them to keep their face still and breathe in through the nose.\nWith the set-up, students should think the following:\no  No articulation, use “pooh”…..not “hooh”\nNo articulation syllable should be used when making set-up sounds.  The ultimate\ngoal is for students to start their sounds with air.  An articulation syllable will be\nassigned after all students are making characteristic and consistent sounds on the\nset-up, as well as the fully-assembled flute.\nStudents need to direct their air down into the embouchure hole (think blowing\ninto a bottle) in order to achieve the desired sound.\nMake sure the students understand that “a sound” may not happen the very first\ntime. This is a trial and error process and may take multiple tries.\nOnce the set-up has been placed correctly and students are making the sound you\nwant, they need to remember:\no  how it looks (by looking in the mirror)\no  how it feels\nAllow and instruct them to take the set-up from your hand without moving their\nbody and embouchure.  Have them try to reproduce the sound on their own.  Be\nprepared to further assist them if necessary.  When the sound is correct, students\nneed to remember how it sounds.\nTrain students to freeze their body, face and embouchure at the end of whatever\ntype of sound is being made (whether it is air, a tone, etc.)  The student should not\nmove anything until the director calls the students to ready position.  This aspect\nof playing should transfer to any—and everything students play in the future (i.e.\nafter last notes of lines out of the book, last notes of songs, etc.)\nWhether students are making individual or group sounds, they need to stop when\nthey feel like they are running out of air.  It should never be thought of as a\ncontest to see who can hold their sounds the longest.  That serves absolutely no\nbenefit.\nIf a student feels dizzy or faint, allow them to bend over in their chair for a little\nwhile until they feel better.\nIf you hear fuzziness or airy sounds in the tone, the student’s aperture is likely too\nwide/big and the air is being aimed too far across.  This is usually caused by\nstudents pulling their corners back, wrong directions of air, top lip is not down\nenough, or a wide aperture.  Students need to constantly be told to bring their top\nlip down.  After a student has been made aware that they are making a fuzzy or\nairy tone, the expectation should be stated for the student to return to class the\nnext day without that issue.\nExtraneous noises at ends of sounds are a result of students collapsing their\nembouchures and/or postures.  Have students sing “la” or “dah”; then, apply that\nto the end of their sound.\nIt is your job, as the teacher, to diagnose any problems through this trial and error\nprocess.  As you go around the room, it may be helpful to you to take written\nnotes on students having problems.  Jot down any catchphrases, analogies or\nspecific things that you said to them that helped them in any way!\nIf you are struggling in your efforts to assist multiple students…..or are unsure\nabout what you are doing in general, then hire an outside consultant or\nexperienced private lesson teacher to come to your class and help.  As this\nprofessional goes around the room to hear your students, you need to follow\nthem……watch exactly what they are doing…..and take notes as well.  No\nmatter the scenario, reference these notes as you see fit in future classes.\nAfter _____ days, students will eventually need to be able to place their set-up\nand make a sound without your assistance.  The amount of time will vary year to\nyear, taking into consideration the size of the class, the overall quality of their\nsounds, and how many times you have assisted the students.\n8th Grade Only: Piccolo students should be relying on either their private lesson\nteacher or 1 on 1 sessions with a director outside of the section/ensemble\nrehearsals if they are having problems creating the proper characteristic sound.\nStudents need to constantly be reminded that characteristic and consistent\nset-up sounds are stepping stones to making sounds on the fully-assembled\nflute!  Students who do not practice their set-up sounds at home are not only\nslowing the class down, but are not contributing to the daily progress and\nquality of the class.\n**Much of this information is applicable to beginner interviews."

    "text": "FLUTE HEADJOINT PLACEMENT\nAND FIRST SOUND\nIf your class is really large, the teacher may want to schedule a 10-15 minute slot\nwith each student before or after school in order to place the headjoint.  Whether\ndone in class or individually, the teacher should be able to see the student’s face\nduring this procedure.  It is assumed that students are exhibiting correct “playing\nposture” at all times.  If this procedure is done in class, the teacher must place\neach student’s headjoint for several days.\nOnce the teacher has guided the student for as long as necessary, he may begin to\nplace the headjoint on his own.  The following steps will take place with careful\nmonitoring from the teacher:\n1.  Students should pick up the headjoint with their fingertips.  The fingertips are\nfacing each other on the crown and at the other end of the headjoint--but not\ncovering the opening.  If the fingertips are facing the student, he may tend to roll\nin or press.\n2.  The headjoint should rest on the “ledge” or “crook” of the chin.\nThere should be no pressure on the jaw.  The headjoint should not be jammed\nagainst the face.\n3.  The students will always direct their air toward the center of the embouchure hole.\n4.  With the headjoint on the ledge or crook of the chin, the edge of the embouchure\nhole will touch where the red and fleshy part of the skin meet.\n5.  The center of the aperture should line up with the center of the embouchure hole.\n6.  The lower lip should cover 1/4-1/3 of the embouchure hole.\nThe flute should line up four ways:\n1.  Left to right\n~The center of aperture should line up with the center of the embouchure hole.  If\nit is off center, move the headjoint to the position of the student’s aperture.  When the\nflute is in its correct playing position, a “pie wedge” is created between the body and\nthe instrument.  This will be demonstrated.\n2.  Front to back\n~The headjoint should not be crooked.  It should be parallel to the lips, but not\nparallel to the body.  There needs to be enough contact so the headjoint will not\n“bounce around.”\n3.  Up and down\n~The headjoint should not slant up and down.  Always center the embouchure\nhole to the aperture.  If the aperture is off center, then move the headjoint to the\ncenter of the student’s aperture.\n4.  In and out\n~As stated above, the lower lip should cover 1/4-1/3 of the embouchure hole.\nThe outside of the lip plate has to be touched by air to get a great sound\n  This means there is more air going into the flute -- when it splits,\nstudents will get their most centered, focused and resonant sound\nAfter headjoint is placed and lined up, then students blow\n  1  2  Breathe  |  Sound\n(3   4)\n  air  2  3  4  |  stop  2  breathe\n(3  4)\n\nremind students often to bring the corners forward -- just like\ndrinking water out of a water fountain!\nFirst Sound\n1.  With a natural face, have the student say the word \"pooh\".  Look and see where\ntheir lips open naturally, as well as where the lips come apart first.\n2.  Blow a kiss and freeze it -- no pucker -- a soft kiss.  Students should feel how\ntheir lips move away from their teeth during this process.\n3.  The aperture is the opening between the lips.  Some apertures will be slightly off\ncenter.  More control can be achieved if the opening is directly in the center of the\nmouth.\n4.  Start with lips touching, and then blow a hole in the center with a \"p\" sound.\n5.  Have students think \"pooh\" --and \"p\"--as the air moves past their lips.  There\nshould be no vocal sound produced.\n6.  In reality, sound is produced on the flute headjoint as the air moves in relation to\nthe embouchure hole."

The tongue's release of the air\nsimply defines the beginning/start of the vibration/sound.\nArticulation is used to define the vibrations necessary to create musical rhythm,\nstyle and movement -- to contrast the use of slurring (which also creates similar\nmusical entities).\nUse the syllable \"too\" or \"toe\" when articulating. This moves the tongue forward\ninside the mouth. These syllables will be very appropriate with most beginning\nflute students.\nThe tongue should lie flat in the mouth and should not feel soft.\nMake sure the sides of the students' tongues are inactive and close to the top teeth\nrather than the bottom teeth.\nUse the syllable \"toe\" or \"tah\" with students that play with the sides of their\ntongue anchored against their top teeth.\nOne taste bud of the student's tongue should be used.\nThe articulation does not stop the sound.\nThere should be no movement in the face, chin or throat.

The syllable used with this style is \"th\" or \"thee.\"\nThis concept is not recommended with beginning flute students.\nYOU WILL NOW BE SHOWN COMBINED EXERCISES THAT WILL HELP\nIMPROVE THE STUDENT’S TONE QUALITY IN ALL OF THE REGISTERS,\nINCREASE RANGE, CREATE EVEN ARTICULATION IN ALL REGISTERS,\nAND TEACH YOUNG STUDENTS HOW TO CONTROL THE ENTIRE\nINSTRUMENT DURING THE FIRST YEAR."

    "text": "CHARACTERISTICS WHEN RECRUITING AND\nSELECTING FLUTE PLAYERS\nPhysical Characteristics/Factors\n  The length of tissue between the bottom of the nose and the bottom of the upper lip\nmust be large enough to pull down and cover the top teeth.  This will help students to\naim their air down into the embouchure hole better for certain notes.\n  Medium, but full lips are preferable—especially the lower lip.\n  A very thin top lip makes it very challenging for students to play with a correct\nsound.\n  Hands and fingers need to be large enough to cover the holes when there are no plugs\nin the keys.\n  Avoid putting students on flute who have a tear drops or “Betty Boop” lips.  A tear\ndrop occurs when the lips come together at a point, resulting in air that splits.\nStudents with teardrops should be steered towards another instrument.\n  There are many outstanding flute players that play to the side, but unless you are\nexperienced at teaching this type of flute embouchure, you should avoid placing\nstudents on flute if they have an extreme tear drop or “crooked embouchure” and\nmust play to the side.  It is very time consuming, and could be very frustrating at first\nfor the student and teacher.  Many times, it can take days…..or even weeks…….to\nproduce acceptable first flute sounds.\n  Avoid placing students on flute who have an extreme overbite or underbite.\n\nIf a student has a protruding tooth, have them close their lips and push where the\nheadjoint will end up being placed.  If that “sensation” is painful to the student, then\nthey should be steered towards an instrument that goes into their mouth.\n  The jaw must be flexible.\n  Students with braces will most likely struggle in general, especially if they start in\nbeginning class without braces.  Encourage parents to inquire with their child’s\ndentist regarding the possibility of using Invisalign.\nNon-Physical Characteristics/Factors\n  There should be no gender bias when selecting flute players; however, you must\nconsider the school climate/demographics when choosing a boy to play the flute.\nKeep in mind that some of the most famous flautists in the world are male (i.e. Sir\nJames Galway, Jean-Pierre Rampal, Julius Baker, etc.)  Therefore, if a boy expresses\ngenuine interest in playing the flute, then move forward from that point.\n  Be prepared to do whatever you have to in order to convince parents—especially\nfathers—that boys can play flute. You may need to do this without the student there;\nstudents should not be present during a discussion that may be getting uncomfortable.\nIf you have boy flute players in your top ensemble, it is an excellent idea to have\nthem demonstrate the flute at your recruiting concert(s)….regardless of their chair."

Teaching vibrato in\ngeneral should NOT be optional during the second semester of the beginning\nyear.\nThe jaw and lips do not move when learning vibrato.\nThe  cheeks  do  move,  because  the  air  pressure  is  changing  inside  the  student’s\nmouth.\nPHASE ONE\nThe  pulse  should  be  super  wide  and  exaggerated  so  it  will  not  disappear  as  it\nbecomes  faster  and  narrower.    If  it  starts  narrow,  it  will  disappear  to  virtually\nnothing.  Do not shy away from absurdity.\n1.  Have the student bend over from the hips.\n2.  Say “ha” with his hand on his stomach so the pulse can be felt.\n3.  First pulses are unmetered and the student should slowly move to normal standing\nposture—approximately  two  inches  at  a  time--as  he  progresses  through  this\nprocedure.\n4.  After  expectations  thus  far  have  been  met,  the  pulses  should  become  metered.\nThe metronome should be set between 60 and 80.\n5.  The syllables used for a whole note in 4/4 time are “Ta-Ha-Ha-Ha” followed by\nfour beats of rest.  Repeat this procedure each time as the student moves into the\nnext position.\n6.  Eventually, more active pulses can be introduced.  These pulses do not require the\nbent  posture  and  therefore  must  not  be  introduced  until  other  expectations  have\nbeen met.\n7.  Repeat the procedure with the flute attached to the headjoint beginning on treble\nclef third-line “B.”\nPHASE TWO\n1.  Once  PHASE  ONE  expectations  have  been  met,  have  students  transfer  from\npulses to throat “clicks.”\n2.  Have  students  say  “eh”  (the  throat  click)…almost  like  when  a  frustrated  child\nsays “Mom, eh” when angry.\n3.  Begin with quarter note clicks, and eventually use more active subdivisions.  Fill\nin time with active air.\n4.  The movement should be wide and “through the sound.”  The movement should\nbe sharp and flat….and loud and soft…at the same time."

    "text": "FLUTE HAND POSITION\nRIGHT HAND POSITION\n1.  Allow the flute to lie back against the left shoulder. The left hand makes a loose\nfist around the open area at the barrel of the flute.\n2.  Place the fingers first by touching the last three keys on the body of the flute with\nthe index, middle and ring finger.\n3.  The fleshy finger pad (pudgy part of your finger) should touch the pads.\n4.  Shape the hand like a “C” (flat “C” or “U” on its side). The fleshy part should be\nin the center of the keys.  Most flutes have circles on the keys.  These circles can\nbe used as guidelines for finger placement.\n5.  Put the little finger down next--on its side, not the fleshy part--and face towards\nthe end of the E-flat key by using the outside of the little finger.  The little finger\nshould be curved like a question mark or a hook.  When this is correct, then have\nstudents perform the “V” exercise.\n6.  Place the thumb.  Have students gently pinch a table or music stand, and then\nrelate that to the flute.  The thumb is placed somewhere between the first and\nsecond finger, where it is most natural.  The thumb needs to go on its side.  The\nthumb and little finger are connected by tendons.  If there is tension in one, there\nwill be tension in the other.  Raise the big knuckles up.  They should be\napproximately level with the keys.\n7.  When the flute is lifted, move the arms from the elbows. The shoulders are not\nengaged, and the elbows remain in the natural position in relation to the\nshoulders.\n8.  The wrist is either straight or slightly arched, but never bent toward the body of\nthe flute.\n9.  The part between the thumb and first finger should be soft and open.  They should\nnever touch.\n10. The middle finger will have more height/bend to it because it is a longer finger,\nbut it cannot hang over the edge. The fingers have a slight curve, but the tips of\nthe fingers are flat.\n11. The right hand goes towards the flute, and should be parallel to the flute.\n12. The fingers of the right hand should float or hover over the keys at all times.\nStudents should “push” down the keys only when appropriate for the fingerings.\nBe sure the palm of the hand is soft so no tension is felt or seen.\n13. The thumb and first finger of the right hand should point in the same direction.\n14. The right hand should never shift towards the lever B-flat key; rather, it should be\nshifted towards the E-flat key.  The only time the right hand index finger will ever\nhave contact with the lever B-flat key is when that fingering is actually being\nused.\nLEFT HAND POSTION\n1.  With the flute in its upright position on the left knee and supported by the right\nhand already in its correct position, the left hand makes a light fist at the barrel\nwhile the fingers are being placed.\n2.  Place the first finger on the second key- then skip one key and place the second\nand third fingers on the next two keys.\n3.  The little finger is placed on the G#/A-flat key, and is curved and never leaves\nthis “home position.”\n4.  The thumb is between 12:00 and 1:00 on the “thumb B-flat” key.  The thumb\nforms a “T” with the body of the flute.\n5.  The palm is close to the body of the flute under the index finger.  The index finger\nshould touch the body of the flute and not look angular as the pad of the finger\ntouches the key.  The back of the left hand should be perpendicular to the flute.\nThere is a slight “break” in its shape.  This can be achieved by rocking the left\nhand towards your body.\n6.  The fingers of the left hand should float or hover over the keys at all times.\n7.  The big knuckle will go somewhere between the first and second physical keys.\n8.  The fingers move from the big knuckles except for the index finger, which moves\nfrom the second joint.\n9.  The tip of the thumb and the base of the thumb should be on the same side of the\nflute.\nAs students get older and more advanced, the focus for finger movement is shifted\nfrom the big knuckles to where the finger tendons are attached to the wrist.\nBe patient with progress towards absolute hand position.  It is best to have\n“double jointed” students not play the flute.\nTo teach independent finger motion, put the fingers on every key and lift each\nsingly.  Be sure all fingers move up and down, and not back and forth.  The same\npart of the finger should touch the same place on the key every time.\nItems That Will Help Hand Position\nDr. Scholl’s Mole Foam are easily obtained in grocery and drug stores.  They are\nself-adhesive, can be cut to fit, and will not ruin the flute.\nBo Peps are made for both the left and right hand.  They simply serve as a guide\nfor the thumbs.\nDr. Scholl’s Gel Corn Pads (with Cushlin Gel) are also easily obtained in grocery\nand drug stores.  They are placed directly underneath the first key.\nThumb Port\nPrima\nSelexa\nPencil Grips\nAdditional Finger Exercises\n1.  All fingers in each hand move together.  Call out the hand you wish to move.  The\nstudents move all of the fingers in that hand down to seat into the pads.  The right\nhand thumb obviously does not ever move when the teacher asks for “RIGHT”,\nbut the left hand thumb will press the B-flat key with the fingers of the left hand\nwhen the teacher asks for “LEFT”.\n2.  Next, we move the fingers one at a time beginning with the left hand.  The thumb\nand first finger are already down in this exercise, and each additional finger in\nboth hands will be numbered two through six from the headjoint to the footjoint.\nThe fingers will move down or up depending on their starting position, as the\nnumber is called by the teacher.  We do not use the little fingers when we first\nbegin this exercise.  Later, they will be numbered seven and eight.\n3.  Watch the fingers to see that they move smoothly, fall into the pads, stay in\nnatural position and move up and down from the big knuckle only.  The left hand\nfirst finger is not active at this time.  The student should understand that the\nmovement is aided by the soft tissue of the palm of the hand, rather than the bony\ntexture of the top of the hand.\n4.  Next, we move the fingers in combinations: one, two….one, two three…….one,\ntwo, three, four……one, two, three, four, five…..one, two, three, four, five,\nsix………six, five, four, three, two, one……five, four, three, two, one…….four,\nthree, two, one……three, two, one………two, one……  Later in the development\nthe thumb movement is added.\n5.  Using these exercises, the fingers move in all of the ways they move to play the\nflute: all together, one at a time, and in combinations.\n6.  The left hand little finger simply moves up and down on the G#/A-flat key, and\nshould never lose contact with this key.  The right hand little finger will be\nstrengthened using the “V” exercise previously mentioned."

    "text": "PICCOLO\nFactors involved for selecting piccolo players\nOne piccolo player can be used in a middle school program--ONLY in the top band.\nHaving a piccolo should not detract from the ensemble; you can always rewrite the\npart for the first flute player.  There are a few exceptions when two piccolo players\nare necessary for a particular piece of music (Marche Des Parachutistes Belges by\nPierre Leemans)\nDo not showcase the piccolo at a recruiting concert unless you explain that only one\nflute player in your entire program gets to play it (and usually that player is an eighth\ngrader).\nDo not even mention or talk about using a piccolo in your band unless you think you\nhave a student physically capable of playing it…..and are planning to program a piece\nof music in which utilizing a piccolo will be necessary.\nDo not sacrifice your flute section by having the top player play piccolo.  The student\nplaying piccolo must sound good, because once a piccolo is added to an ensemble\nsound, it is hard to hide.    You must also have “remaining” top flute players in your\nsection that also sound good and can handle the first part.\nChoose a student with a naturally small aperture and with thin lips.  Students having\nfuller lips will have difficulty with flexibility and focusing their sound.\nAuditions for Piccolo\nWait a month or two after school starts before you even start mentioning the\npossibility of utilizing a piccolo in your ensemble.\nIf at all possible, allow an 8th grader to play the piccolo over a 7th grader.\nDo not encourage or allow any flute player to have their parents go out and buy a\npiccolo.  This is extremely presumptuous, unfair to other students and in general\ninappropriate.  Do not allow yourself to be “strong-armed” into anything regarding\nthe selection of a piccolo player.\nIn most cases a school-owned piccolo will be used.  With that said, make sure that it\nis good playing condition and have someone you trust test its playing condition.\nWooden piccolos are preferable to plastic and metal piccolos for inside playing.\nPlastic piccolos are preferable to metal piccolos for marching band purposes.\nFind out how many students are interested in trying out for the piccolo.\nConsult with your private lesson teacher or colleague regarding what the audition\nshould consist of.\nGive the piccolo to each student for one school night each so that they have equal\ntime to play on it and practice.  It is not fair to give a student the piccolo over the\nweekend.\nHave auditions the day after the last week night that a student had the piccolo at\nhome.\nHire someone from the outside to hear the audition.  Try to select a band director or\nprivate lesson flautist; even if someone on your staff is a flautist.  This way,\ndisgruntled parents will not be able to say that the auditions were in anyway unfair.\nOnce the student is officially selected, do not encourage he/she to buy their own\npiccolo because there is no guarantee that they will play it as a 9th or 10th grader in\nhigh school.  Now in knowing that there is no guarantee that they will be allowed or\nhave the opportunity to play piccolo in high school, the student’s parents may still\nwant to purchase a piccolo!  This can only be a good thing, because the newly-\npurchased piccolo may be in better condition than your school-owned piccolo(s)!\nIf the official student is really good and is probable to succeed, allow them to play\npiccolo at your Winter Concert (or right after the winter break).\nWarm-ups\nYour piccolo player should warm-up half the time on their flute and half the time on\nthe piccolo.  This is so the student does not “lose” their flute chops…….and because\nthey may not end up playing the piccolo on all music being performed in the\nensemble at any given performance during the school year.\nYour piccolo player must use a doubler stand—whether they are able to purchase one\nor you acquire one through your budget.  You should never allow a piccolo to be\n“housed” on the music stand when not in use.  \nAvoid having your piccolo player go back and forth between flute and piccolo in your\nprogrammed music. Going back and forth between a multi-movement piece is ok, but\nnot within movements.\nWhen utilizing a piccolo in your ensemble, be smart about what to play.\nEncourage and allow your piccolo player to use a violin clip-on tuner.  With that said,\nthe piccolo player should not be required to look at the director during warm-up\nexercises that are to be memorized by all other members of the ensemble.\nWhen looking at the tuner, do now allow the piccolo player to look down.  This will\nresult in he/she looking down and thus rolling in and covering too much of the\nembouchure hole.    The music stand needs to be at the appropriate height.\n.\nTendencies\nStudents playing piccolo will tend to play more “pinched” because the aperture tends\nto be smaller.\nThe pitch tendency on piccolo is to play sharp.  When a student transfers from flute\nto piccolo, monitor carefully as they will tend to roll in and cover too much of the\nembouchure hole.\nRegion-Band (Middle and High School)\nDo not just “throw” someone on piccolo just to get another student into region-band.\nDo not force students into a bad audition situation just because they play piccolo.\nThis experience may result in long-term negative affects for the student.\nYou may want to suggest that your piccolo player bring ear plugs into the audition\nroom(s)."

    "text": "FLUTE ARTICULATION EXERCISES\nWhen starting articulation exercises, the use of mirrors is vital.\nRemind students that the tongue only interrupts the air – it never stops the air.\nArticulating with black notes as opposed to white notes, encourages students to move\ntheir tongues down quicker.\nMake sure from the very beginning, students sing and play in a connected/legato style.\nExercises to be taught in the following order:\n1.  Have students sing on “la” or “lu,” and then ultimately on the syllable “too” or “toe.”\nIf students are unable to sing in a connected style, they should not progress to the next\nstep.\n2.  Have students put their hand or index finger in front of their face and feel their air.\nStudents should feel continuous air and not “puffs” of air.\n3.  Go around the room and have each student tongue air at your hand, so you can assess\ntheir ability to do it correctly.\n4.  Students should not see their aperture size changing as they articulate\n5.  Using a mirror, students should articulate with or without their hand/index finger,\nmaking sure that their face, chin, throat and aperture are not moving.\n6.  When you feel students have mastered the previous exercises, allow them to articulate\n– using the syllable “too” or “toe” – on the headjoint and off the lip plate.  They\nshould still be able to see their vapor trail.\n7.  Allow students to articulate as fast as they can, articulate using the \"ta-day\" syllable.\n8.  Allow the students to start the sound and use the \"ta-day\" syllable.\n9.  Allow the students to start the sound and articulate by snapping your finger on\ncommand.\n10. With the metronome, begin to incorporate easy follow-the-leader rhythms with you\nsinging or modeling – and the students echoing on their headjoint.  Whole rests may\nor may not be necessary between you and the students.  As with your initial sound\nproduction exercises, students need to continue lightly tapping each beat on the end of\nthe headjoint while they are playing.  This ensures that students are thinking internal\nsubdivision.\n11. Before progressing to the fully-assembled flute, assign the following playing test on\nthe headjoint:\nAttach the headjoint to the body of the flute and begin articulation.  Students must be\nconstantly reminded that they should be articulating in the same way as they were when\njust using the headjoint.\nWhether students are playing white notes or black notes, they must constantly be\nreminded that the tongue moves down quickly.\nWhen students can successfully sing note names on the same pitch, allow them to\narticulate multiple notes on the same pitch.\nWhen pulse and foot pat are learned, students articulate every time their foot touches the\nfloor – and then when their foot touches the floor and as it comes up\nOnce the student is able to read music, call the articulation \"rhythmic articulation\".\nStudents should be tonguing as the music moves across the page.\nDo not allow students to articulate back-to-back notes on different pitches until they are\nplaying with absolute connected style on notes of the same pitch.\nWhen the tongue is moving correctly, you must decide when it is appropriate to have\nstudents begin coordinating finger movement with articulation.\nWhen students articulate back-to-back notes on different pitches, they cannot stop their\nair as they change fingerings.\nTeach Mary Had a Little Lamb in four segments by singing and then playing:\nAfter all students have successfully played each segment of Mary Had a Little Lamb,\nbegin to string together the segments into the following finished product:\nUltimately, students should be able to execute any or all of the following on a daily basis:\no  articulate as fast as they can\no  articulate using the \"ta-day\" syllable\no  articulate on command\no  articulate with foot pat and articulate rhythms\nWhen playing exercises out of the method book, you can return to previously-learned\nlines and add articulation.  Do not feel like all lines must be executed again during class;\nassign students to perform all lines at home with articulation."

    "text": "FLUTE CASES, IDENTIFYING AND REMOVING\nPARTS, ASSEMBLY, MAINTENANCE AND\nINSTRUMENT/BODY RATIO\nGeneral Information About All Woodwind Instrument Cases\nMost cases have distinguishing marks somewhere on the case.  Identify these\nmarks, and their relationship to the top and bottom of the case.  Most cases have\nthe handles placed on the bottom section of each case.  Check to make sure.\nPlace all cases on the floor in front of the student, or on a large table in the correct\nposition.  Flute cases are more easily opened from the top of a large table.\nBe sure the student understands where each part of the instrument belongs in the\ncase.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make sure\nthe student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure the\nparts of the instruments are returned to the case in the reverse order they were\nremoved.\nAll instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure\nexplicitly every time.\nNever leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up, but\nthis is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.  Check\neach opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to your\nstudents.\nCases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom\nsetup for each student’s case.\nIdentifying and Removing Parts Safely From Its Case\nOnce the case information is understood, place the case on a flat surface.  Never\nlet the student place the case in his lap.\nOpen the case from its correct position.  Remember, most latches will lift up.\nStudents must be taught to keep one hand on some part of the flute at all times.\nWith the left hand, take the body out and lightly grasp the end with no keys\n(barrel).  Turn the body so the barrel is facing towards the left, and the G#/A-flat\n(“teardrop”) key is away from the student’s body.\nWith the right hand, take out the footjoint and hold without touching any keys.\nTurn the footjoint so that the “roller” keys face the student’s body.\nPut the flute together with slight, twisting motions. Discourage students from\nusing their knees as leverage while assembling the body and the footjoint.  If\nstudents have difficulty, have them wipe off the edges.\nTo line up the flute, the rod of the footjoint must point to the center of the last\ncircular key on the body.  This may need to be adjusted for the size of the\nstudent’s right hand.\nHold the flute at the barrel with the left hand as it is gently resting on the left\nknee.\nPick up the headjoint with the right hand and attach to the barrel.\nMake sure the headjoint is properly aligned with the rest of the flute so that the\ncenter of the embouchure hole is aligned to the circular keys of the body.  After\nfully assembled, use the entire flute as you would when looking through a\ntelescope.\nSEND SEGMENTS OF THIS INFORMATION HOME TO PARENTS.\nCHOOSE THE INFORMATION YOU THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL\nFOR HOME PRACTICE AND INSTRUMENT CARE.\nLook at the case in relation to the parts of the flute.  Most cases are molded to the\nshape of a particular part.  Be specific when making this point to your students.\nTake your time, and repeat the information many times.  Notice that all circular\nkeys are toward the ceiling when placed correctly in the case.  Damage will occur\nif the parts are placed incorrectly in the case.\nThe embouchure hole on the headjoint must be facing the ceiling when placed\ncorrectly in the case.\nTake the instrument apart in the exact opposite manner keeping your hands on\nthe pieces you are removing.\nInstrument Maintenance\nStudents should have a white cotton cloth in their cases.  It can be used to wipe\nmoisture off keys after use.  They can either tie the cloth to the handle—or wrap it\naround the cleaning rod inside the case.  The latter will prevent the cleaning rod\nfrom scratching the part of the flute.   No unnecessary objects may be placed in\nthe case at any time.  Only the parts of the flute should be allowed in the case.\nThe student should be given CLASS TIME to clean out his instrument, and store\nproperly in the case.  A textured cloth is great to remove grease or fingerprints\nfrom the flute.  Students can also wipe both the tops and in between the keys with\nthis cloth.\nStudents need to clean the dust and moisture out of their flutes by using either the\ncleaning rod, a small/thin paintbrush or a small soft bristle brush used to apply\nmakeup.  Thread the cotton cloth through the eye of the cleaning rod.  Swab the\nbody and footjoint from both ends.  Do not force the cloth through either part.\nIf you choose to teach your students to swab out the headjoint, they must be\ncareful and delicate when inserting the cleaning rod into the headjoint.\nBE VERY SPECIFIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nInstrument/Body Ratio\nFamiliarize the student with the instrument/body ratio by using the entire\nassembled flute…and also without the headjoint.\nMove the instrument up and down, side to side by using the elbows.  All aspects\nof the brass instrument information hold true here.  The body playing position\nalso holds true from previous information.  We are merely getting used to the\nweight of the instrument; the position of the instrument; and the angle of the\ninstrument without using correct hand position.  The student should not squeeze\nthe instrument as these exercises are practiced.  Keep the palms of the hands soft.\nThe three balance points of the flute are the chin, the left hand index finger\n(whose knuckle provides stability on the outside of the instrument) and the right\nhand thumb (which lifts and supports the flute).\nFamiliarize the student in this manner for a few days before placing the fingers in\ntheir correct position."

Configure your classroom based on how many students you have in the class.\n3.  Start off the semester by putting students in alphabetical order so you can learn their\nnames faster.  Once music stands and mirrors are utilized in class, hanging name tags can\nbe used if you have not yet learned every student’s name.\n1.  Arched set-up\n\nIf using your “ensemble set-up” for your class, have students sit in a “box”, so\neveryone gets the same amount of attention/eye contact from you.\n  Have students sit in every other chair (if all chairs have to remain in your set-up\nthroughout the day).\n  The aisles between your rows must be large enough so that you will have quick and\neasy access to any student-both from the front and the back.\nIf you end up needing to use risers, make sure the backings are on them for safety\nreasons.\n  As much as possible, have students in “windows.”\n  You must be able to see everyone from the front.  With that said, you are not always\nable to correct student’s posture, hand position, etc. from the front of the room.  Thus,\nyou need to be walking around the room often.\nEventually, it would be very beneficial to put your weaker players in the front row so\nthat you can give them even more attention.\n2.

Again, flute players need to be on the same side of the ensemble as the French horn\nplayers because they are considered color instruments.  First chairs need to sit together so\nthey can more easily balance and match in terms of balance, pitch, etc.\n2.  It would be a great idea to sit 7th and 8th graders alternately so the 7th graders can hear\nvibrato being used by an 8th grader on one or both sides of them.

    "text": "FLUTE EXERCISES FOR GROUP SOUNDS\nGroup exercises—whether on the headjoint (“short instrument” or “baby instrument”) or\nthe fully-assembled flute—should be performed with the assumption that you have gone\naround the room as much as necessary before allowing students to make sounds on their\nown in this group setting.\nYou must make the decision as to when to allow short instruments to go home with your\nstudents.\nThe use of mirrors is imperative so students are consistent with everything they are doing.\nBreathing should already be introduced by this point.\nThe metronome should already be introduced by this point.\nFor exercises 1-6, articulation has not been taught at this time; therefore, “pooh” starts are\nused and.  The tongue should remain naturally at the bottom of the mouth.\nRemind students to always be thinking pulse……as well as “start” and “stop” when\nappropriate.\nWhen appropriate for a specific exercise, audiation of note names with actual pitches is\nhighly recommended.\nHEADJOINT EXERCISES\n1.  Drill “ready position” and “playing/set position” DAILY.\na.  Call students to “ready position”….then to “playing/set position”….and back to\n“ready position”, etc.  For shorter/faster instructions, simply say “ready” and\n“set/playing.”\nb.  Repeat this over and over and over.\nc.  This teaches students how to set their short instruments.\nd.  Students must look at mirrors! DO NOT make them look at you.\n2.  Allow students to make sounds on their own.\na.  Students must exhibit good posture.\nb.  Students should be holding their short instrument correctly.\nc.  Students should be taking proper breaths.\nd.  Holding headjoint correctly\ne.  You, the instructor, need to monitor students, both visually and audibly. DO NOT\nbury your head in your stand.\nFor all exercises that use the metronome, students can lightly tap their right hand fingers\non the headjoint for keeping track of the beats.  Quarter note = 80 (with subdivisions) is a\ngood tempo to perform all exercises at.\n3.  With a model playing (or you if flute is your primary instrument)\na.  All students should be looking at the model, who should be standing directly\ncentered and in front of the class.  The instructor should be walking around the\nclassroom and monitoring students.\nb.   There should never be an overlap of sound between the model and the class;\nalways place a whole rest in between the model and the class.\nc.  Teach students the “start…stop” drill (using audiation).\nd.  The model and the entire class should breathe on beat 3 (when in 4/4/ time).\ne.  Sound the subdivision on the metronome at ALL TIMES. Start this at the very\nbeginning.  If students are having trouble, help then with their foot tap by putting\nyour foot on top of theirs.\nf.  During rests and while the model is playing, you must talk to students about the\nnecessity about staying completely set.  This will more quickly help students to\nlearn where exactly to place their short instrument.  The students should look so\nstill to the point they look like they are still playing!\ng.  The only embouchure movement that is allowed is for students that are having\ndifficulty making a sound…..and need to adjust something in order to achieve a\nsound.\n4.  Model, Student A, Model, Student B, Model, Student C, etc.\na.  Always place a whole rest in between the model and the student.\nb.  After every few students play, have the entire class play as a group.\nc.  The model should be walking around the room with the instructor, so that all\nstudents can more easily see the model’s embouchure, etc.\nd.  Depending on the size of your class, it is your decision to have students stay in\n“playing/set position” the entire time…..or instead allow students to be in\n“playing/set position” after every __ students.\n5.  Have all students stand and play one sound; if they do not get a sound for any reason,\nthey have to sit down.  \na.  The metronome is not used for this exercise.\nb.  Tell students that do not get sounds that they need to practice more at home!\nc.  Have some sort of incentive for those students who are still standing at the end of\none or more rotations.\n6.  Entire class—without a model—playing whole note, whole rest, etc… with the\nmetronome.\na.  Perform this type of exercise when you feel the class is ready\nb.  Before students play, have them audiate using “start”………stop.”\n7.

Again, students can audiate the “start……stop” drill.\nb.  All students are thinking “tu.”\n9.  The instructor or model performs random—yet not complicated rhythms, and the entire\nclass imitates (still with “pooh” … NO tongue).\na.  Perform these rhythms both with and without whole rests in between the\nmodel/instructor and the class.\nb.  It would be a good idea to incorporate rhythms—from the beginning band method\nbook used in your class—that have not yet been introduced.\n**EVERY CLASS FOR A FEW MONTHS OR SO MUST BEGIN WITH SOME SORT\nOF HEADJOINT EXERCISE!!!!**\nFULLY-ASSEMBLED FLUTE EXERCISES\n1.  The first note students should play is 3rd space C#/Db.\nThis note can be played before teaching actual hand position.\nAt this point, hand position should already be taught.\n2.  Slur diatonic notes from third-space C down to middle C.\nFor the very first note (third space C), students need to pull their top lip down over\ntheir top teeth and aim their air lower into the embouchure hole.\nThere are three apertures on flute.  This particular exercise focuses on the lower\nregister, and therefore a more oval and straight across aperture is necessary for proper\ntone quality and resonance.\n3.  Teach students to play what are considered the “special” notes on flute.\nC♯/Db, C♮, B♮, A#/Bb\nFor these notes (and later on an octave higher), students need to pull their top lip\ndown over their top teeth and aim their air lower into the embouchure hole.\nThe tendencies of these “special” notes is for the tone to be airy, and the pitch to be\nsharp.\nBy shaping the top lip and aiming the air down, the pitch will be lowered and it will\nhelp create a more resonant sound.\nC#/Db is THE sharpest note on the flute -- especially with a poor embouchure.\nYou must talk the students through this process.  You should not be playing these\nnotes or demonstrating for them, unless flute is your primary instrument.\n4.  Lip push-up exercises\nPerform this exercise with a coffee stirrer.\nThe goal is for the upper lip to maneuver the stirrer up and down\nRegarding students who are playing with apertures which are too large: remind them\nabout the size of the stirrer and relate that size to the size of their aperture.\n5.  Typical exercises you will see in most beginner method books\nCan be performed with or without articulation\nChanging notes; can be performed with or without articulation\nProgressive adding of more notes; can still be performed with or without\narticulation\nWhen you approach the first line in the book—which contains two or more back-\nto-back notes—these notes must obviously be articulated.  Therefore, you must\nhave already taught articulation with the proper syllable before these lines can be\nattempted.\nWHEN YOU TEACH ARTICULATION, YOU MUST FIRST INTRODUCE IT\nON THE HEADJOINT!!!"

    "text": "FLUTE EMBOUCHURE\nStudents must be able to use air correctly before beginning to learn the flute\nembouchure.\nThere should be no creases near the mouth or nose that are not naturally present.\nThe corners of mouth should be soft, forward and away from the teeth, but moved\ntoward the canine/vampire teeth.\nThere should be a “circle of air” behind the lips.\nThere should be a “pocket of air” between the lips and teeth.\nThe eyes remain soft and do not change.\nThe lower lip should be soft and fleshy.\nThe corners should touch the lip plate.\nAs much lower lip as possible should touch the lip plate.\nThe wet part of the lips surround the air.\nLet the air blow the lips apart.\nLip and Teeth Formations To Avoid\nWhen the embouchure is formed, a teardrop occurs when the center of the top lip\ndoes not appear to be smooth from corner to corner.  This is often referred to as a\n“bud” or as having “Betty Boop” lips.  When the wet part of the top lip is smooth,\nthe teardrop may disappear, making the wet part of the lip smooth from corner to\ncorner.  If the teardrop does not disappear, the student’s aperture will form off\ncenter.  Be aware, however, that if a student plays off center, their lips will be\ntight on one side.\nWhen working with students with very full bottom lips, set the headjoint a bit\nhigher, and gradually pull it down as the student progresses.\nWhen working with students with thin bottom lips,  place the lip plate lower  on\nthe white flesh and have the student roll their bottom lip out to simulate a fuller\nlook.\nStudents with very thin top lips should not be recruited to play the flute.  The top\nlip is critical to correct air direction and tone production.\nStudents with crooked or crossed/overlapped front teeth should not be recruited to\nplay to the flute.\nStrengthening the Embouchure\nPlace a coffee stirrer/straw on the wet part of the lips and have the student “grip”\nthe straw with the inside of their lips.  This helps students understand the strength\nof their lips and the size of their aperture.\nFor apertures that are too large, have students perform lip “pushups” with their\nstraw.  The top lip should aim the straw (air) down.  Instruct students to make the\nwet part of their lips meet…….press…..relax…..press…relax…etc.  Have\nstudents watch their faces in the mirror as they do ten exercises, and then rest.\nUpper Cheek Inflation\nUpper cheek inflation occurs when there is air allowed in the cheeks while the corners\nblow away from the teeth.  While teaching this concept, you must carefully monitor\nstudents’ aperture sizes, as they may become too large.  Students can simply think of\n“little puffs of air” or “little circles of air”.  If you do not feel comfortable teaching this\nconcept, pay an experienced flutist to help your students.  Cheek inflation is a vital\ncomponent of the “finished” flute embouchure and will help create the most resonant\ntone quality.  This concept should be taught as soon as headjoint sounds are made,\nwhether it is by you or a professional."

    "text": "INSTRUMENTS OF THE TRUMPET/CORNET/FLUGELHORN FAMILY\nBb/A Piccolo Trumpet\nEb/D Trumpet\nC Trumpet\nBb Trumpet\nCornet\nFlugelhorn\nHerald Trumpet\nPiccolo Trumpet\nPitched in Bb; reads an octave lower than a Bb trumpet or a minor 7th below concert pitch\nSounds an octave above the Bb trumpet\nCan also be found pitched in G, F, and C (all 3 are rare)\nThese instruments come with either an adjustable tuning leadpipe or two separate leadpipes.\nThe longer leadpipe (or simply pulling out on the adjustable crook) allows the trumpet to play on “the A side” (referring to A piccolo instead of Bb).\n“The A side” of the horn reads a major 7th lower than Bb trumpet or a major 6th below concert pitch.\nSounds a major 7th above the Bb trumpet\nWhen switching or adjusting the tuning leadpipe, make sure to loosen and tighten the wing nut, or its equivalent, to open and close the diameter of the trumpet’s leadpipe. A loosened leadpipe will cause the trumpet to slide too easily against the embouchure when applying the pressure necessary to play the instrument.\nWhen tuning the instrument, always loosen/fasten the trumpet leadpipe. Do not cut corners and try to play the instrument while adjusting the slide. Not only can the instrument slide into the embouchure, but it is very hard to play the instrument while adjusting the length of the trumpet.\nTuning notes are 3rd space C, 2nd line G, middle C and below the staff D (if trumpet has 4 valves).\nMost musicians will use “the A side” of the horn when playing in key signatures (concert pitch) with sharps (G, D, A, E…) as the transposed key adds 3 flats (Bb, F, C, G…).\nThese keys will mainly be found in baroque music such as Music for the Royal Fireworks by George Frideric Handel and Trumpet Voluntary by Jeremiah Clark.\nIf playing in key signatures (concert pitch) with flats (F, Bb, Eb, Ab…), musicians will use “the Bb side” as the transposed key adds 2 sharps (D, C, F, Bb…).\nThese keys will mainly be found in orchestral or pop music such as Petrouchka by Igor Stravinsky and Penny Lane by The Beatles.\nWhen playing in the key of concert C, it is up to the performer which side he/she will play on. It is more common that they choose the Bb side due to easier trills (especially on scale degrees 4 and 7).\nThe trumpet either has 3 or 4 valves. If it has 4 valves, the fingerings are identical to a euphonium (a D on this trumpet and a C on the euphonium are both fingered 4th valve; a C# on this trumpet and a B on the euphonium are both fingered 2nd and 4th valve). Because the 4th valve is not quickly adjustable like the 1st and 3rd valve slides, it is important to set the 4th valve slide by tuning below the staff D. European countries prefer rotary valves similar to those found on a French horn.\nThe piccolo trumpet uses a trumpet mouthpiece. Depending on the brand of piccolo trumpet, such as “Schilke”, some might use a cornet mouthpiece.\nThe most common mouthpiece associated with this trumpet is a Bach 7EW.\nThe piccolo trumpet is not to be used by a MS/JH or HS student, as it is a novelty instrument mainly used in brass ensembles. It is not recommend to allow students to practice on a piccolo trumpet because it plays very differently from the larger trumpets and can begin to affect the established sounds made on a Bb trumpet if not carefully monitored.\nPitched in Eb; reads a fourth lower than a Bb trumpet or a minor 3rd below concert pitch\nSounds a perfect fourth higher than the Bb trumpet\nEasily identified by the leadpipe leading directly into the third valve casing\nBecause the leadpipe must remain relatively short and close to the instrument, the trumpet comes with what is called a “tuning bell”. Some brands will mimic the piccolo trumpet and have crooks instead of bells.\nLike the piccolo trumpet, the Eb trumpet comes with an Eb bell and a D bell.\nThe D bell is pitched in D and reads a major 3rd lower than Bb trumpet or a major 2nd below concert pitch.\nIt sounds a major 3rd higher than the Bb trumpet.\nTo keep the instrument in tune with itself, one will also find 1st, 2nd, and 3rd valve slides associated with each side of the trumpet. They are usually kept in small plastic bags and uniquely identified by a small “Eb” or “D” engraved on each of the slides.\nLike the wing nut on a piccolo trumpet, there will either be one or two fasteners to attach the bell to the remainder of the trumpet. If they are not properly fastened, there is a risk of the bell falling off while playing.\nAs mentioned while tuning the piccolo trumpet, do not try to move the bell while playing.\nTuning notes are 3rd space C and 2nd line G (and additionally middle C for professional players).\nTuning tendencies are very different from a Bb trumpet. Most E-flat trumpets, especially Schilkes, have very long 1st valve slides, making 2nd space A’s and below the staff D’s in tune, but 1st line F’s and 4th line D’s flat.\nNot used as often as the piccolo trumpet as most music played on an Eb/D trumpet can also be played on a Bb/C trumpet, respectively\nLiterature selections include Trumpet Concerto in Eb by Joseph Haydn, Trumpet Concerto in E major (usually arranged and performed in Eb) by Johann Nepomuk Hummel and Mass in B minor (D trumpet) by Johann Sebastian Bach\nLike the piccolo trumpet, it is not recommend to introduce this instrument to pre-college students. None of the standard band literature requires students to know this instrument and the only time one will find an Eb part is either in a military band, a brass band or the occasional college marching band if still using military band orchestration.\nPitched in C; reads concert pitch (non-transposing)\nSounds a major 2nd higher than the Bb trumpet\nTuning notes are 3rd space C and 2nd line G (and additionally middle C for professional players)\nEuropeans will use rotary valves over piston valves to acquire a bigger and darker sound.\nThese trumpets are more commonly found in a professional orchestra. While some high schools allow their students to use these trumpets, it is recommended that the following criterion are fulfilled:\nEvery student in the section has both a Bb trumpet and a C trumpet.\nEvery student in the section is taking private lessons with a teacher who is both familiar with the horn and can teach transposition.\nThey are only to be played if the whole section agrees.\nThey are either played on every piece in a performance or none of the pieces. Do not mix and match.\nStudents have demonstrated equal or greater proficiency than their skills on a Bb trumpet.\nStudents still spend time practicing on their Bb trumpet\nBecause the above mentioned requirements are usually not fulfilled until the college level, it is not recommended to utilize C trumpets. While the C trumpet plays near identical to the Bb trumpet, the hassle is far too great for the desired outcome.\nPitched in Bb; reads a major 2nd above concert pitch\nSounds a major 2nd below concert pitch\nIf a student is started on a cornet, they “step-up” to a Bb trumpet\nMost commonly used in MS/JH and HS\nUses a cornet mouthpiece (the leadpipe is smaller, requiring a smaller shank to fit it)\nCreates a very different sound due to its conical bell (similar to the French horn and tuba)\nSome beginners are started on a cornet and eventually “step-up” to a Bb trumpet\nVery good to have in HS inventory as it can be used in very popular band literature (3 cornet parts, 2 trumpet parts)\nMost commonly used in MS/JH\nUses a flugelhorn mouthpiece – not a trumpet mouthpiece)\nLike the cornet, it uses a conical bell\nBecause the leadpipe leads directly into the valve casing, the flugelhorn uses a leadpipe tuning slide (similar to the piccolo trumpet).\nUsed in very few concert pieces, but almost necessary in every other jazz ballad\nDuring marching season, some band directors prefer the use of a flugelhorn solo during a slower/lyrical section of the performance.\nOnly to be used by HS students who are very proficient in their Bb trumpet skills\nRecommended to keep 2 in stock at the HS level\nSimply put, it is a Bb trumpet with an elongated bell.\nThis trumpet has no use in a non-professional setting, as it is only used in organized groups (U.S. Army Herald Trumpets).\nUNIQUE VARIATIONS OF THE TRUMPET\nTypes of Valves\nRotary\nFound on Bb, C, and piccolo trumpets\nStandard European style of trumpet\nPiston\nUsed on every American trumpet\nInvented by the French; best choice when playing etudes\nTypes of Tuning slides\nConventional\nTuning slide fits into leadpipe\nThe most common in trumpets\nReverse\nLeadpipe slides into tuning slide\nOffers less resistance\nRequires more endurance\nLeadpipe\nInserted into the trumpet’s leadpipe from the embouchure end\nMouthpiece is then inserted into the leadpipe’s mouthpiece receiver\nFound on flugelhorns and piccolo trumpets\nBell\nAdjusted from where the bend of the bell meets the pipe exiting the first valve casing\nFound on Eb/D trumpets\nTypes of valve slide adjustors\nSaddle\nFound on the first valve slide\nThe most common first valve slide adjustor\nRing\nFound on both the first valve slide and the third valve slide\nThe most common third valve slide adjustor\nNot uncommon to find beginner trumpets that have adjustable rings attached to the third valve slide\nTrigger\nThe least common of both valve slide adjustors\nFound on older models and unpopular ones\nFunctions by pressing the vertical lever into the valve casing, pushing out the slide to a set distance\nThe distance the slide moves after pressing the trigger can be adjusted (when the instrument is not being played); therefore, the trigger is not recommended as different notes require different distances (low C# requires more 3rd valve slide than below the staff D and above the staff A requires more 1st valve slide than 5th line F).\nRECOMMENDED TRUMPET/CORNET/FLUGELHORN BRANDS\nTrumpets/Cornets:\nBeginner:\nBrand: Yamaha\nModel: YTR-2330\nPricing: MSRP $1,233.00 - $1,383.00 @ wwbw.com\nDescription:\nStudent-owned instrument\nYellow brass bell/leadpipe\n.459” bore\nMonel valves\n#1 recommended beginner trumpet\nModel: YCR-2330II\nPricing: MSRP $1,149.99 @ wwbw.com\n.462” bore\nNickel-plated Valves\n#1 recommended beginner cornet\nIntermediate:\nModel: YTR-4335GII Intermediate\nPricing: MSRP $1,474.99 - $1,624.99 @ wwbw.com\nGreat middle/high school trumpet\nGold brass bell\nYellow brass body\nBrand: Bach\nModel: TR200 Series\nPricing: MSRP $1,919.00 - $2,059.00 @ wwbw.com\nYellow brass bell\nLacquer finish\nProfessional:\nModel: 180S37\nPricing: MSRP $2,759.00 - $2,879.00 @ wwbw.com\nThe professional pick of all Bach trumpets\nUsed for orchestral playing\nYellow/gold brass bell\nSilver finish\nModel: YTR-8335 Xeno Series\nPricing: MSRP $2,417.99 - $2,567.99 @ wwbw.com\nMost cost effective trumpet for high school students\nSlightly heavier\nModel: YTR-9335CHS Xeno Chicago Artist Series\nPricing: MSRP $4,651.99 @ wwbw.com\nVery common orchestral trumpet\nCreated with the input of John Hagstrom, the 2nd trumpet in the CSO (Chicago Symphony Orchestra)\nIncredible projection\nModel: YTR-9335NYSII Xeno New York Artist Series\nCreated with the input of David Bilger, principal trumpet in the PSO (Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra)\nFlugelhorns:\nBrand: Conn\nModel: 1FR Vintage One Series\nPricing: MSRP $2,429.00 - $2,549.00 @ wwbw.com\nSchool-owned instrument\n6” hand-hammered one-piece rose brass bell\n.413” bore\nModel: YFH-8310Z Custom Z Series\nPricing: MSRP $2,739.99 - $2,916.99 @ wwbw.com\n6” yellow brass bell\nGold brass leadpipe\nRECOMMENDED TRUMPET MOUTHPIECES\nModel: 7C\nPricing: MSRP $56.00 @ wwbw.com\nA beginner’s first mouthpiece\nMedium-small cup size\nFits the smaller embouchure of a 6th grade student\nModel: 3C\nGreat for middle school/junior high and high school students\nUsed as a step-up mouthpiece for graduating 8th grade students\nMedium cup size\nModel: 1½C\nThe most common mouthpiece found in professional orchestras\nUsed as a step-up mouthpiece for graduating high school students who plan to study music\nFor players with larger lips, this cup size might open up a “tight” sound.\nLarge cup size\nTRUMPET MOUTHPIECE INFORMATION\nFactors to consider when looking at a mouthpiece\nA trumpet mouthpiece will not fit a cornet sized leadpipe and a vice versa.\nIf the instrument has a small bore (.425 and smaller) consider using a mouthpiece with a bigger cup/cup diameter or a looser throat/backbore\nIf the instrument has a large bore (.460 and larger) consider using a mouthpiece with a smaller cup/cup diameter or a tighter throat/backbore\nThe above mouthpiece recommendations are used to compensate for “the blow”, or resistance, of the instrument. A trumpet with too much resistance will cause false security in note accuracy and constrict the sound. A trumpet with too little resistance will require more effort and quickly wear out a player.\nBecause mouthpiece adaptations can become expensive, it is recommended that the private lesson teacher holds the decision to move a student to a uniquely tailored mouthpiece.\nBasic terminology\nBore size refers to the instrument you are playing, not the mouthpiece. The bore size is the inside diameter of the leadpipe. Small bore trumpets are typically .410-.425 inch and large bore trumpets are typically .460-.470 inch.\nCornet shank mouthpieces refer to mouthpieces that can fit on a cornet or certain piccolo trumpets; these shanks are smaller than trumpet shanks.\nTrumpet shank mouthpieces refer to mouthpieces that can fit on a trumpet. This is your typical shank size and will fit on almost every instrument of the trumpet family.\nCup Size refers to the depth/shallowness of the empty space inside the cup.\nCup diameter refers to the width of the space stretching from one side of the inner rim to the opposite side.\nThroat refers to the small section right after the cup ends. This is not where students hold the mouthpiece.\nBackbore refers to the space inside the shank of the mouthpiece. This is where students hold the mouthpiece.\nRim refers to the flat or rounded surface that makes contact with the embouchure.\nSilver vs. gold plating\nThere has been much controversy surrounding the issue of playing on silver-plated or gold-plated mouthpieces. These issues include the following:\nEndurance\nTone quality\nEase of playing\nOverall embouchure health\nSo what is the truth? Because the embouchure is incredibly personal and can only be truly determined and developed on an individual level, the issue, as a whole, does not really matter. Students will discover what works best for them as they develop, and they should only do so under the supervision of an experienced band director and/or private lesson instructor.\nIt is recommended to start beginners on a silver mouthpiece. A silver mouthpiece is cheaper, and because it is uncertain whether or not the student will have embouchure issues on the onset, there is no need to have students start on a gold mouthpiece (which is twice as expensive).\nPARTS OF THE TRUMPET MOUTHPIECE\nSPECTRUM OF A TRUMPET MOUTHPIECE\nTRUMPET MAINTENANCE KIT – RECCOMMENDED ITEMS\nOR\n______________________________________________________________________________\nTRUMPET MAINTENANCE KIT – OPTIONAL RECOMMENDED ITEMS\nTRUMPET MAINTENANCE\nMouthpiece Maintenance\nOver time, grime and other dirty objects build up in the mouthpiece.\nTo clean the mouthpiece:\nTake a mouthpiece brush and run it through the mouthpiece under warm water in the sink.\nThe brush will not go all the way through, so insert the brush to the throat, twist and pull out.\nSoap is not necessary, but it does not hurt the mouthpiece to use it. The same goes for mouthwash. If these are used, simply rinse the mouthpiece thoroughly afterwards and let it air dry so that the alcohol evaporates.\nThis process should be done every week to two weeks.\nSlide Maintenance\nThe insides of the slides and various tubes build up grime, various dirt particles, and germs, so the slides must be snaked at least once a month.\nTo snake a horn:\nTake out the appropriate slide, pressing down the appropriate valve while taking it out, and place the slide on a towel or soft surface.\nRun water through the unattached slide, preferably in the opposite direction of air flow.\nIn the case of the main tuning slide and the lead pipe, also run water through the lead pipe – starting on the end with the tuning slide, not the end with the mouthpiece receiver.\nTake the snake and run it through the slide which was taken out, preferably in the opposite direction of air flow.\nRepeat the above step on the immovable part of the slide attached to the rotor. Be careful to not jam the snake against the 3rd valve piston.\nRepeat the above two steps with all slides, including the main tuning slide, the 1st valve slide, 2nd valve slide, and 3rd valve slide\nApply slide grease as necessary according to the below steps.\nThere are 4 slides on the trumpet. Each of these must be well-lubricated with slide grease. Refer to the “Maintenance Kit” handout for pictures of slide greases.\nTo apply the grease:\nTake out the slide to be greased, pressing down the appropriate valve.\nWith some cheesecloth, wipe off the slide to clean the grease and any grime on the slide.\nIf the grease is a liquid, squeeze the bottle and apply a line of grease down two sides of the slide. If the grease is more of a cream, use the index finger to apply the grease along most of the length of the slide.\nDo not apply too much grease, as the slides can become too lubricated and fall out.\nRe-insert the slide and slide it fully in and out a few times. Insert only one side of the slide in and rotate the slide while moving it in and out. Press down the appropriate valve the entire time during this process.\nPush the slide all the way in and use a paper towel to wipe off any extra grease located where the immovable and movable parts of the slide meet.\nRepeat this process for all slides as needed.\nApply 1-2 drops of valve oil onto the inner slides of the 1st valve slide (make sure the valve is held down during this part as mentioned earlier).\nMoving the slide in and out, the oil should thin out the grease and cause the slide to become very responsive.\nWipe down the greasy solution that collects where the immovable and movable parts of the slide meet.\nRepeat steps 7-9 for the 3rd valve slide.\nThis process should be done every month or so.\nValve Maintenance\nIf consistently played on, a trumpet should have no “sticky valves” for a month.\nOn the other hand, a trumpet that is not played on for 2-3 days in a row can begin to become less responsive.\nTo re-oil the valves:\nBegin twisting from the top valve cap until the cap comes off of the valve casing.\nHolding the valve by the finger button, completely remove the valve without twisting or rotating it inside the casing.\nWith some cheesecloth, wipe down any old oil from the piston.\nApply a healthy coat of oil on the whole piston, but do not intentionally apply any oil inside the ports as it will simply go to waste once air is blown through the horn.\nTake a look inside the valve casing:\nThere should be two notches on the sides of the valve casing; this is where the guides on the valve will be placed.\nOne notch should be slightly bigger/different from the other one. Be sure to align the correct guide with the correct slot.\nCarefully insert the valve, without twisting or rotating it, inside the appropriate valve casing.\nRepeat for any other “sticky” valves.\nTRUMPET METHOD BOOKS\nSUPPLEMENTAL TRUMPET BOOKS\nTRUMPET CASES, IDENTIFICATION OF PARTS AND REMOVING IT FROM ITS CASE\nGeneral Information About All Brass Cases\nMost cases have distinguishing marks somewhere on the case.  Identify these marks, and their relationship to the top and bottom of the case.  Most cases have the handles placed on the bottom section of each case.  Check to make sure.\nPlace all trumpet cases on the floor in front of the student.\nBe sure the student understands where and which direction each part of the instrument belongs in the case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make sure the student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure the parts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse order they were removed.\nThe trumpet should be removed first, followed by the mouthpiece.  When putting instrument back, the order is reversed – mouthpiece first, followed by the trumpet.\nAll instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure explicitly every time.\nNever leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up, but this is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.  Check each opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to your students.\nCases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom setup for each student’s case.  If using an ensemble room for the class, the cases may be opened in the hall.  The empty case will remain closed and latched in the hall during class.\nWhen instruments are in their cases, do not allow students to sit on their cases AT ANY TIME because the lead pipe or bell will get bent.\nPARTS OF THE TRUMPET\nPARTS OF THE TRUMPET VALVE\nTRUMPET ASSEMBLY, HAND POSITION AND INSTRUMENT/BODY RATIO\nAssembly\nPlace the case on the floor. Most latches on trumpet cases face up.\nOpen the case and make sure that both the horn and the mouthpiece are secure.\nRemove the trumpet with your left hand and grasp from the valve casing. If the trumpet is correctly positioned in the case, it should be held with the side facing upward.\nHolding the trumpet in the left hand, carefully remove the mouthpiece with the right hand.\nSeat the mouthpiece gently into the leadpipe, and rotate 2/3 of a turn for a friction grip.\nInstrument/Body Ratio\nAssuming that the student is either standing or sitting with correct posture, instruct them to pick up the body of the trumpet with both hands and simply lift it by using their elbows.  Move the instrument up and down, side to side, higher than usual and lower than usual.  As students are doing this, have them notice how it affects the balance of the body.  Eventually, the body should feel as balanced with or without the instrument in hand.\nHand Position\nThe most natural shape of everyone’s hands forms a “flat-C.”\nAll hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall behind the wrist.\nThere should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the trumpet.\nThe inside of the arm must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding the trumpet correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\nElbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be hampered.\nPlace both the left and the right hand in their correct position.  Remember the left hand does not “grip” the instrument.  No tension should be felt in this hand when holding the instrument.\nThe right thumb is placed in its natural position, which is between the first and second valve casing.  The thumb must never bend in any direction!  The index, middle and ring fingers are curved and the fleshy part of the fingertips is placed on the pearls of the valve caps and should never lose contact with the caps.  The pinky is slightly curved and placed on TOP of the “ring.”  This pinky should never be placed INSIDE the “ring”, as this will cause students to “pull” the instrument into their embouchure and cause major problems.\nThough not a part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling the instrument toward the student’s face.  Instruct students to keep their elbows soft while playing the trumpet.\nThe palms of both hands should feel soft.  The palm of the right hand should never touch the instrument.  The teacher should be able to clearly see a “circular” opening between the right hand and the instrument.\nThe student should understand that finger movement is aided by the soft tissue of the palm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand.\nTRUMPET FACE/EMBOUCHURE\nEach student should use their own “safe/unbreakable” mirror—both in the classroom and at home.\nUsing the mirror, have each student notice how natural their face looks.  They will have to later remember and memorize how it looks and feels.\nThe head must be balanced on the shoulders in a comfortable position—not too far forward and not too far backward.\nThe eyes should be soft and natural, and the “sight line” should be exactly level.  The distance between eyebrows should not change as air goes in and out of the body.\nLook for natural creases in the face, and allow any that are naturally present to exist while playing.  No other creases are allowed.\nThe corners should move in toward the canine/eye teeth.  The corners should never look or feel pulled back.\nThe corners can move down from the natural position as the student progresses but they can never move up.\nThe texture of both the upper and lower lip should be very soft and relaxed.\nThere should be natural space between the inside of the lips and the gums and teeth.  This space should not change or feel different when the lips vibrate inside the cup of the mouthpiece.\nThe back teeth are slightly apart and should feel the same as when the student is reading, watching television, etc.  The teeth should not be pressed into each other when doing these other activities.\nBrass instrument embouchures are formed with a natural overbite.  A student with an underbite should be steered away from brass instrument.\nThe thickness of a student’s lips should correspond to the size of the cup of the mouthpiece for the chosen instrument.  Students with a very full top or bottom lip should be steered towards low brass instruments rather than trumpet.\nThe bottom of the front of the tongue should lie in the soft tissue area which is located in the front of the mouth just behind the ridge of the bottom gum.\nRemember that when playing the trumpet, cheeks will only “puff out” if the air is not freely going into the instrument.\nAssuming that the above has been achieved, the embouchure will be formed with special attention to the following:\nThe mouthpiece must be placed in the middle of the mouth—up and down as well as side to side.\nThe corners are in their natural position and should be set against the canine/eye teeth.\nThe lips must be allowed to freely vibrate in response to the airstream rather than made to “buzz” in front of the airstream.\nThe lips must feel natural so that air can freely move past them—they must not be pulled back against the teeth or blown away from the teeth and gums.\nThe students should remember that the mouthpiece “gathers” the air—not the lips.\nThere must never be more energy placed against the upper lip than the lower lip; hence the instrument will angle slightly downwards.\nTRUMPET ARTICULATION\nThe tongue moves in the same manner when articulating a brass instrument as it does when you speak.  The tongue moves up and down—not back and forth—both when speaking and when articulation on an instrument.\nThe purpose of the tongue is to release the air which causes the lips to vibrate and creates the sound.  The tongue’s release of the air simply defines the beginning/start of the vibration/sound.\nArticulation is used to define the vibrations necessary to create musical rhythm, style and movement--to contrast the use of slurring (which also creates similar musical entities).\nThe students should think that the tongue “articulates” the sound created by the airstream.  If the student is taught to create the sound correctly, articulation will be an easy transition.\nsound occurs when the air moves past the naturally vibrating lips\narticulate the sound that is already present\nteach students to articulate at the moment the sound begins\nWithout the instrument or mouthpiece, use the following procedure:\nSay the word “DOG”.\nSing the syllable “DAH”.\nOnce these are mastered, have the student use the mouthpiece and instrument and reproduce the “DAH” syllable in their brain to create an articulated sound.\nThe tongue should feel the same when saying, singing and playing the mouthpiece and instrument.\nThe tongue should touch the enamel of the upper teeth directly below the gum line—in the same spot with the same strength every time.\nUse the syllable “DAH” because it creates smoother and more easily controlled air as opposed to the “TAH” syllable.\nAfter each “articulation”, the tongue must immediately fall down into its natural “at rest” position.\nThe tongue will be naturally soft at all times, but can touch the teeth with different strengths.\nThe tongue will be in its “down position” 98% of the time when articulating correctly.\nHave the student start their sound with the air.\nUsing the information about the basics of articulation, have the student articulate as fast as they can with no limitations of numbers, worries about evenness of articulation, etc.  Simply get them used to articulating!\nHave the student then use the “ta-day” syllable to practice using the tongue in an organized manner.\nHave the student then articulate “on command.”  The student will start their sound, and articulate when you snap your fingers to practice gaining more control of the tongue.\nOnce the student understands pulse and the foot pat, have the student articulate exactly when the toe of the foot touches the floor.\nHave the student articulate with the down and up position of the foot.\nProceed to written rhythms as they begin to read music.\nAlways practice this entire routine.  The student must always go through the entire process, so he will not lose the ability to move his tongue at various speeds and in structured manners.\nTRUMPET FLEXIBILITY AND\nRANGE EXTENSION\nBrass playing is based upon flexibility.\nThere are two types of flexibility: flexibility within the instrument and flexibility within the note.\nStudents eventually need to be flexible through each of the harmonic series in order to move up and down within the range of the instrument.\nOnce the student can reproduce at will a given pitch, the teacher must decide whether flexibility up or down is needed first.\nIt is important to remember that note flexibility is controlled by air direction and the isometrics created by the corners and canine/eye teeth. The head must always stay in its natural, balanced position at all times.  The angle of the instrument must not change at any time.\nStudents must learn to angle the air in the cup of the mouthpiece without changing the position of the lips and/or the relationship of the upper and lower teeth.\nFlexibility is also enhanced by vowel sounds used in various registers.  These sounds can be “ah” for the middle register….”ee” for the upper register….and “oh” for the lower register.  Have students practice saying these vowel sounds with vocalization on appropriate lower, middle and higher sounds.\nThe speed of the air and the shape of the vowel guide flexibility. The tongue assists the air speed similar to the way one’s thumb assists the water speed from a hose. The tongue relaxes when descending into the lower register and arches when ascending into the upper register.\nBring to the students’ attention that the shape of the tongue changes dramatically from vowel sound to vowel sound.  All students should be aware that vowel sounds are the middles of words that they speak every day.  Practice saying words that use the required vowel sounds. (i.e.  bow, ball, beep)\nRange is developed through flexibility.  It is more important to create a resonant sound while practicing flexibility than to create wider intervals.  The student can enhance their range by making more resonant sounds in the middle register before trying to extend higher or lower.\nWhile it is important to create resonant sounds in the register students can play in, it is important for students to occasionally try exploring both the upper and lower range they struggle to make a good sound in. This should be practiced perhaps twice a week.\nMake sure students understand the texture of the lips have nothing to do with range.  For example, students should never be told to “tighten” their lips in order to play in the higher register.\nTRUMPET GENERAL TUNING TENDENCIES\nThe Overtone Series\nThere are 7 possible combinations of fingerings:\nOpen\n2\n1\n1-2 (3rd valve alone is about the same length)\n2-3\n1-3\n1-2-3\nEach one plays a series of slotted notes. Displayed below are all the possible notes that can be played while pressing no valves down (open).\nThe lowest note is not stable, but technically exists. This note is easier to hit on the flugelhorn and cornet than it is on the trumpets. However, because it does not concern trumpet tuning tendencies, we will consider the middle C to be the lowest note.\nThe order of valve combinations listed above will lower every note on the staff by a half-step. 2nd valve’s lowest note would be a B, 1st valve’s a Bb, etc…\nBecause each overtone series is in tune with itself, switching between all 7 will cause tuning tendencies.\nTo overcome a tuning tendency, the following can be done:\nVowel shape/air direction adjustment\nValve slide adjustment\nAlternate fingering\nBefore going over which adjustment should be used when, it is important to go over the specific tuning tendencies.\nSharp Notes\nFlat Notes\nVowel Shape/Air Direction\nVowel shape/air direction is the most common adjustment that will be made with younger students.\nFor the upper register:\nStudents who are above pitch or have a pinched/strident sound are most likely closing their teeth. Remind students that even when making an “ee” vowel shape in the upper register, there should be space between the back teeth.\nStudents who are below pitch or have a weak/unsupported sound are most likely not using fast enough air or their tongue is not arched enough (“ee” vowel shape).\nFor the lower register:\nStudents who are above pitch or have a pinched/thin sound are most likely not playing with a big enough vowel shape. Ask students to drop their jaws and blow warm, calm air through the space between their teeth.\nStudents who are below pitch or have a sagging/dull sound are most likely letting their corner collapse and/or not keeping their corners firm. Remind students that even a relaxed vowel shape and air stream are supported by the same embouchure used to play a concert F.\nThe middle register is a good place for students to practice their flexibility within a note. Create games and exercises for students to manipulate which direction they blow their air (up/down) and the vowel shape they use to change the pitch of a note (while maintaining a characteristic sound).\nTo bend a note up, blow the air higher into the mouthpiece and make the vowel shape smaller.\nTo bend a note down, blow the air lower into the mouthpiece and make the vowel shape bigger.\nEncourage students to perform the aforementioned adjustments on both the mouthpiece alone and on the instrument.\nValve Slide Adjustment\nThe two slides that a student can adjust while he/she is playing are the 1st and 3rd valve slide.\nRule of thumb: If a note is sharp, AND the student is making a characteristic and resonant sound, the corresponding slide should be kicked out.\nThe pitch of second space A, fingered 1-2, can be lowered by kicking out the first valve slide.\nThe pitch of below-the-staff D, fingered 1-3, is not in tune unless the 3rd valve slide is kicked.\nThe pitch of below-the-staff C#, fingered 1-2-3, is not in tune unless the 3rd valve slide is kicked. This note needs more 3rd valve slide kicked out than below the staff D.\nTeach both D and C# as 1-3 trigger (referring to the kicking out of the 3rd valve slide) and 1-2-3 trigger.\nIf a student is not using any alternate fingerings, the 3rd valve slide should not be utilized on any other note. Most valve combinations including the 3rd valve are either in tune or have a flat tendency.\nThere are many notes with sharp tendencies that involve the 1st valve. Because of this, students should learn how to kick out the 1st valve slide at different lengths.\nAlternate Fingerings\nUsing the overtone series, one can find more options that are not specifically listed.\n1-2-3 for 4th space E\n1 for above the staff C\n1-3 for above the staff G\n2 for above the staff A\nThat being said, a band director should only know these fingerings if all else fails. Most alternate fingerings, especially higher notes using more valves than required, will dull the sound and drastically change the pitch. There will be occasions where a student brings his/her own trumpet with very different tuning tendencies and needs an uncommon option.\nWhen it comes to trills, alternate fingerings are completely acceptable. Students should learn that a G#-A trill is easier and cleaner to execute using 3rd valve instead of 1st and 2nd for the A.\nAt the high school level, it is more than acceptable to try fingerings that either darken or brighten the tone for chord balance purposes. This is why many professionals will simply play an above the staff A 3rd valve when playing in an F major chord."

Identify these marks, and their relationship to the top and bottom of the case.  Most cases have the handles placed on the bottom section of each case.  Check to make sure.\nPlace all trumpet cases on the floor in front of the student.\nBe sure the student understands where and which direction each part of the instrument belongs in the case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make sure the student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure the parts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse order they were removed.\nThe trumpet should be removed first, followed by the mouthpiece.  When putting instrument back, the order is reversed – mouthpiece first, followed by the trumpet.\nAll instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure explicitly every time.\nNever leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up, but this is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.  Check each opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to your students.\nCases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom setup for each student’s case.  If using an ensemble room for the class, the cases may be opened in the hall.  The empty case will remain closed and latched in the hall during class.\nWhen instruments are in their cases, do not allow students to sit on their cases AT ANY TIME because the lead pipe or bell will get bent.\nPARTS OF THE TRUMPET\nPARTS OF THE TRUMPET VALVE"

Most latches on trumpet cases face up.\nOpen the case and make sure that both the horn and the mouthpiece are secure.\nRemove the trumpet with your left hand and grasp from the valve casing. If the trumpet is correctly positioned in the case, it should be held with the side facing upward.\nHolding the trumpet in the left hand, carefully remove the mouthpiece with the right hand.\nSeat the mouthpiece gently into the leadpipe, and rotate 2/3 of a turn for a friction grip.\nInstrument/Body Ratio\nAssuming that the student is either standing or sitting with correct posture, instruct them to pick up the body of the trumpet with both hands and simply lift it by using their elbows.  Move the instrument up and down, side to side, higher than usual and lower than usual.  As students are doing this, have them notice how it affects the balance of the body.  Eventually, the body should feel as balanced with or without the instrument in hand.\nHand Position\nThe most natural shape of everyone’s hands forms a “flat-C.”\nAll hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall behind the wrist.\nThere should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the trumpet.\nThe inside of the arm must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding the trumpet correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\nElbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be hampered.\nPlace both the left and the right hand in their correct position.  Remember the left hand does not “grip” the instrument.  No tension should be felt in this hand when holding the instrument.\nThe right thumb is placed in its natural position, which is between the first and second valve casing.  The thumb must never bend in any direction!  The index, middle and ring fingers are curved and the fleshy part of the fingertips is placed on the pearls of the valve caps and should never lose contact with the caps.  The pinky is slightly curved and placed on TOP of the “ring.”  This pinky should never be placed INSIDE the “ring”, as this will cause students to “pull” the instrument into their embouchure and cause major problems.\nThough not a part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling the instrument toward the student’s face.  Instruct students to keep their elbows soft while playing the trumpet.\nThe palms of both hands should feel soft.  The palm of the right hand should never touch the instrument.  The teacher should be able to clearly see a “circular” opening between the right hand and the instrument.\nThe student should understand that finger movement is aided by the soft tissue of the palm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand."

    "text": "INSTRUMENTS OF THE TRUMPET/CORNET/FLUGELHORN FAMILY\nBb/A Piccolo Trumpet\nEb/D Trumpet\nC Trumpet\nBb Trumpet\nCornet\nFlugelhorn\nHerald Trumpet\nPiccolo Trumpet\nPitched in Bb; reads an octave lower than a Bb trumpet or a minor 7th below concert pitch\nSounds an octave above the Bb trumpet\nCan also be found pitched in G, F, and C (all 3 are rare)\nThese instruments come with either an adjustable tuning leadpipe or two separate leadpipes.\nThe longer leadpipe (or simply pulling out on the adjustable crook) allows the trumpet to play on “the A side” (referring to A piccolo instead of Bb).\n“The A side” of the horn reads a major 7th lower than Bb trumpet or a major 6th below concert pitch.\nSounds a major 7th above the Bb trumpet\nWhen switching or adjusting the tuning leadpipe, make sure to loosen and tighten the wing nut, or its equivalent, to open and close the diameter of the trumpet’s leadpipe. A loosened leadpipe will cause the trumpet to slide too easily against the embouchure when applying the pressure necessary to play the instrument.\nWhen tuning the instrument, always loosen/fasten the trumpet leadpipe. Do not cut corners and try to play the instrument while adjusting the slide. Not only can the instrument slide into the embouchure, but it is very hard to play the instrument while adjusting the length of the trumpet.\nTuning notes are 3rd space C, 2nd line G, middle C and below the staff D (if trumpet has 4 valves).\nMost musicians will use “the A side” of the horn when playing in key signatures (concert pitch) with sharps (G, D, A, E…) as the transposed key adds 3 flats (Bb, F, C, G…).\nThese keys will mainly be found in baroque music such as Music for the Royal Fireworks by George Frideric Handel and Trumpet Voluntary by Jeremiah Clark.\nIf playing in key signatures (concert pitch) with flats (F, Bb, Eb, Ab…), musicians will use “the Bb side” as the transposed key adds 2 sharps (D, C, F, Bb…).\nThese keys will mainly be found in orchestral or pop music such as Petrouchka by Igor Stravinsky and Penny Lane by The Beatles.\nWhen playing in the key of concert C, it is up to the performer which side he/she will play on. It is more common that they choose the Bb side due to easier trills (especially on scale degrees 4 and 7).\nThe trumpet either has 3 or 4 valves. If it has 4 valves, the fingerings are identical to a euphonium (a D on this trumpet and a C on the euphonium are both fingered 4th valve; a C# on this trumpet and a B on the euphonium are both fingered 2nd and 4th valve). Because the 4th valve is not quickly adjustable like the 1st and 3rd valve slides, it is important to set the 4th valve slide by tuning below the staff D. European countries prefer rotary valves similar to those found on a French horn.\nThe piccolo trumpet uses a trumpet mouthpiece. Depending on the brand of piccolo trumpet, such as “Schilke”, some might use a cornet mouthpiece.\nThe most common mouthpiece associated with this trumpet is a Bach 7EW.\nThe piccolo trumpet is not to be used by a MS/JH or HS student, as it is a novelty instrument mainly used in brass ensembles. It is not recommend to allow students to practice on a piccolo trumpet because it plays very differently from the larger trumpets and can begin to affect the established sounds made on a Bb trumpet if not carefully monitored.\nPitched in Eb; reads a fourth lower than a Bb trumpet or a minor 3rd below concert pitch\nSounds a perfect fourth higher than the Bb trumpet\nEasily identified by the leadpipe leading directly into the third valve casing\nBecause the leadpipe must remain relatively short and close to the instrument, the trumpet comes with what is called a “tuning bell”. Some brands will mimic the piccolo trumpet and have crooks instead of bells.\nLike the piccolo trumpet, the Eb trumpet comes with an Eb bell and a D bell.\nThe D bell is pitched in D and reads a major 3rd lower than Bb trumpet or a major 2nd below concert pitch.\nIt sounds a major 3rd higher than the Bb trumpet.\nTo keep the instrument in tune with itself, one will also find 1st, 2nd, and 3rd valve slides associated with each side of the trumpet. They are usually kept in small plastic bags and uniquely identified by a small “Eb” or “D” engraved on each of the slides.\nLike the wing nut on a piccolo trumpet, there will either be one or two fasteners to attach the bell to the remainder of the trumpet. If they are not properly fastened, there is a risk of the bell falling off while playing.\nAs mentioned while tuning the piccolo trumpet, do not try to move the bell while playing.\nTuning notes are 3rd space C and 2nd line G (and additionally middle C for professional players).\nTuning tendencies are very different from a Bb trumpet. Most E-flat trumpets, especially Schilkes, have very long 1st valve slides, making 2nd space A’s and below the staff D’s in tune, but 1st line F’s and 4th line D’s flat.\nNot used as often as the piccolo trumpet as most music played on an Eb/D trumpet can also be played on a Bb/C trumpet, respectively\nLiterature selections include Trumpet Concerto in Eb by Joseph Haydn, Trumpet Concerto in E major (usually arranged and performed in Eb) by Johann Nepomuk Hummel and Mass in B minor (D trumpet) by Johann Sebastian Bach\nLike the piccolo trumpet, it is not recommend to introduce this instrument to pre-college students. None of the standard band literature requires students to know this instrument and the only time one will find an Eb part is either in a military band, a brass band or the occasional college marching band if still using military band orchestration.\nPitched in C; reads concert pitch (non-transposing)\nSounds a major 2nd higher than the Bb trumpet\nTuning notes are 3rd space C and 2nd line G (and additionally middle C for professional players)\nEuropeans will use rotary valves over piston valves to acquire a bigger and darker sound.\nThese trumpets are more commonly found in a professional orchestra. While some high schools allow their students to use these trumpets, it is recommended that the following criterion are fulfilled:\nEvery student in the section has both a Bb trumpet and a C trumpet.\nEvery student in the section is taking private lessons with a teacher who is both familiar with the horn and can teach transposition.\nThey are only to be played if the whole section agrees.\nThey are either played on every piece in a performance or none of the pieces. Do not mix and match.\nStudents have demonstrated equal or greater proficiency than their skills on a Bb trumpet.\nStudents still spend time practicing on their Bb trumpet\nBecause the above mentioned requirements are usually not fulfilled until the college level, it is not recommended to utilize C trumpets. While the C trumpet plays near identical to the Bb trumpet, the hassle is far too great for the desired outcome.\nPitched in Bb; reads a major 2nd above concert pitch\nSounds a major 2nd below concert pitch\nIf a student is started on a cornet, they “step-up” to a Bb trumpet\nMost commonly used in MS/JH and HS\nUses a cornet mouthpiece (the leadpipe is smaller, requiring a smaller shank to fit it)\nCreates a very different sound due to its conical bell (similar to the French horn and tuba)\nSome beginners are started on a cornet and eventually “step-up” to a Bb trumpet\nVery good to have in HS inventory as it can be used in very popular band literature (3 cornet parts, 2 trumpet parts)\nMost commonly used in MS/JH\nUses a flugelhorn mouthpiece – not a trumpet mouthpiece)\nLike the cornet, it uses a conical bell\nBecause the leadpipe leads directly into the valve casing, the flugelhorn uses a leadpipe tuning slide (similar to the piccolo trumpet).\nUsed in very few concert pieces, but almost necessary in every other jazz ballad\nDuring marching season, some band directors prefer the use of a flugelhorn solo during a slower/lyrical section of the performance.\nOnly to be used by HS students who are very proficient in their Bb trumpet skills\nRecommended to keep 2 in stock at the HS level\nSimply put, it is a Bb trumpet with an elongated bell.\nThis trumpet has no use in a non-professional setting, as it is only used in organized groups (U.S. Army Herald Trumpets).\nUNIQUE VARIATIONS OF THE TRUMPET\nTypes of Valves\nRotary\nFound on Bb, C, and piccolo trumpets\nStandard European style of trumpet\nPiston\nUsed on every American trumpet\nInvented by the French; best choice when playing etudes\nTypes of Tuning slides\nConventional\nTuning slide fits into leadpipe\nThe most common in trumpets\nReverse\nLeadpipe slides into tuning slide\nOffers less resistance\nRequires more endurance\nLeadpipe\nInserted into the trumpet’s leadpipe from the embouchure end\nMouthpiece is then inserted into the leadpipe’s mouthpiece receiver\nFound on flugelhorns and piccolo trumpets\nBell\nAdjusted from where the bend of the bell meets the pipe exiting the first valve casing\nFound on Eb/D trumpets\nTypes of valve slide adjustors\nSaddle\nFound on the first valve slide\nThe most common first valve slide adjustor\nRing\nFound on both the first valve slide and the third valve slide\nThe most common third valve slide adjustor\nNot uncommon to find beginner trumpets that have adjustable rings attached to the third valve slide\nTrigger\nThe least common of both valve slide adjustors\nFound on older models and unpopular ones\nFunctions by pressing the vertical lever into the valve casing, pushing out the slide to a set distance\nThe distance the slide moves after pressing the trigger can be adjusted (when the instrument is not being played); therefore, the trigger is not recommended as different notes require different distances (low C# requires more 3rd valve slide than below the staff D and above the staff A requires more 1st valve slide than 5th line F)."

    "text": "TRUMPET MAINTENANCE\nMouthpiece Maintenance\nOver time, grime and other dirty objects build up in the mouthpiece.\nTo clean the mouthpiece:\nTake a mouthpiece brush and run it through the mouthpiece under warm water in the sink.\nThe brush will not go all the way through, so insert the brush to the throat, twist and pull out.\nSoap is not necessary, but it does not hurt the mouthpiece to use it. The same goes for mouthwash. If these are used, simply rinse the mouthpiece thoroughly afterwards and let it air dry so that the alcohol evaporates.\nThis process should be done every week to two weeks.\nSlide Maintenance\nThe insides of the slides and various tubes build up grime, various dirt particles, and germs, so the slides must be snaked at least once a month.\nTo snake a horn:\nTake out the appropriate slide, pressing down the appropriate valve while taking it out, and place the slide on a towel or soft surface.\nRun water through the unattached slide, preferably in the opposite direction of air flow.\nIn the case of the main tuning slide and the lead pipe, also run water through the lead pipe – starting on the end with the tuning slide, not the end with the mouthpiece receiver.\nTake the snake and run it through the slide which was taken out, preferably in the opposite direction of air flow.\nRepeat the above step on the immovable part of the slide attached to the rotor. Be careful to not jam the snake against the 3rd valve piston.\nRepeat the above two steps with all slides, including the main tuning slide, the 1st valve slide, 2nd valve slide, and 3rd valve slide\nApply slide grease as necessary according to the below steps.\nThere are 4 slides on the trumpet. Each of these must be well-lubricated with slide grease. Refer to the “Maintenance Kit” handout for pictures of slide greases.\nTo apply the grease:\nTake out the slide to be greased, pressing down the appropriate valve.\nWith some cheesecloth, wipe off the slide to clean the grease and any grime on the slide.\nIf the grease is a liquid, squeeze the bottle and apply a line of grease down two sides of the slide. If the grease is more of a cream, use the index finger to apply the grease along most of the length of the slide.\nDo not apply too much grease, as the slides can become too lubricated and fall out.\nRe-insert the slide and slide it fully in and out a few times. Insert only one side of the slide in and rotate the slide while moving it in and out. Press down the appropriate valve the entire time during this process.\nPush the slide all the way in and use a paper towel to wipe off any extra grease located where the immovable and movable parts of the slide meet.\nRepeat this process for all slides as needed.\nApply 1-2 drops of valve oil onto the inner slides of the 1st valve slide (make sure the valve is held down during this part as mentioned earlier).\nMoving the slide in and out, the oil should thin out the grease and cause the slide to become very responsive.\nWipe down the greasy solution that collects where the immovable and movable parts of the slide meet.\nRepeat steps 7-9 for the 3rd valve slide.\nThis process should be done every month or so.\nValve Maintenance\nIf consistently played on, a trumpet should have no “sticky valves” for a month.\nOn the other hand, a trumpet that is not played on for 2-3 days in a row can begin to become less responsive.\nTo re-oil the valves:\nBegin twisting from the top valve cap until the cap comes off of the valve casing.\nHolding the valve by the finger button, completely remove the valve without twisting or rotating it inside the casing.\nWith some cheesecloth, wipe down any old oil from the piston.\nApply a healthy coat of oil on the whole piston, but do not intentionally apply any oil inside the ports as it will simply go to waste once air is blown through the horn.\nTake a look inside the valve casing:\nThere should be two notches on the sides of the valve casing; this is where the guides on the valve will be placed.\nOne notch should be slightly bigger/different from the other one. Be sure to align the correct guide with the correct slot.\nCarefully insert the valve, without twisting or rotating it, inside the appropriate valve casing.\nRepeat for any other “sticky” valves."

A trumpet with too much resistance will cause false security in note accuracy and constrict the sound. A trumpet with too little resistance will require more effort and quickly wear out a player.\nBecause mouthpiece adaptations can become expensive, it is recommended that the private lesson teacher holds the decision to move a student to a uniquely tailored mouthpiece.\nBasic terminology\nBore size refers to the instrument you are playing, not the mouthpiece. The bore size is the inside diameter of the leadpipe. Small bore trumpets are typically .410-.425 inch and large bore trumpets are typically .460-.470 inch.\nCornet shank mouthpieces refer to mouthpieces that can fit on a cornet or certain piccolo trumpets; these shanks are smaller than trumpet shanks.\nTrumpet shank mouthpieces refer to mouthpieces that can fit on a trumpet. This is your typical shank size and will fit on almost every instrument of the trumpet family.\nCup Size refers to the depth/shallowness of the empty space inside the cup.\nCup diameter refers to the width of the space stretching from one side of the inner rim to the opposite side.\nThroat refers to the small section right after the cup ends. This is not where students hold the mouthpiece.\nBackbore refers to the space inside the shank of the mouthpiece. This is where students hold the mouthpiece.\nRim refers to the flat or rounded surface that makes contact with the embouchure.\nSilver vs. gold plating\nThere has been much controversy surrounding the issue of playing on silver-plated or gold-plated mouthpieces. These issues include the following:\nEndurance\nTone quality\nEase of playing\nOverall embouchure health\nSo what is the truth? Because the embouchure is incredibly personal and can only be truly determined and developed on an individual level, the issue, as a whole, does not really matter. Students will discover what works best for them as they develop, and they should only do so under the supervision of an experienced band director and/or private lesson instructor.\nIt is recommended to start beginners on a silver mouthpiece. A silver mouthpiece is cheaper, and because it is uncertain whether or not the student will have embouchure issues on the onset, there is no need to have students start on a gold mouthpiece (which is twice as expensive)."

    "text": "TRUMPET ARTICULATION\nThe tongue moves in the same manner when articulating a brass instrument as it does when you speak.  The tongue moves up and down—not back and forth—both when speaking and when articulation on an instrument.\nThe purpose of the tongue is to release the air which causes the lips to vibrate and creates the sound.  The tongue’s release of the air simply defines the beginning/start of the vibration/sound.\nArticulation is used to define the vibrations necessary to create musical rhythm, style and movement--to contrast the use of slurring (which also creates similar musical entities).\nThe students should think that the tongue “articulates” the sound created by the airstream.  If the student is taught to create the sound correctly, articulation will be an easy transition.\nsound occurs when the air moves past the naturally vibrating lips\narticulate the sound that is already present\nteach students to articulate at the moment the sound begins\nWithout the instrument or mouthpiece, use the following procedure:\nSay the word “DOG”.\nSing the syllable “DAH”.\nOnce these are mastered, have the student use the mouthpiece and instrument and reproduce the “DAH” syllable in their brain to create an articulated sound.\nThe tongue should feel the same when saying, singing and playing the mouthpiece and instrument.\nThe tongue should touch the enamel of the upper teeth directly below the gum line—in the same spot with the same strength every time.\nUse the syllable “DAH” because it creates smoother and more easily controlled air as opposed to the “TAH” syllable.\nAfter each “articulation”, the tongue must immediately fall down into its natural “at rest” position.\nThe tongue will be naturally soft at all times, but can touch the teeth with different strengths.\nThe tongue will be in its “down position” 98% of the time when articulating correctly.\nHave the student start their sound with the air.\nUsing the information about the basics of articulation, have the student articulate as fast as they can with no limitations of numbers, worries about evenness of articulation, etc.  Simply get them used to articulating!\nHave the student then use the “ta-day” syllable to practice using the tongue in an organized manner.\nHave the student then articulate “on command.”  The student will start their sound, and articulate when you snap your fingers to practice gaining more control of the tongue.\nOnce the student understands pulse and the foot pat, have the student articulate exactly when the toe of the foot touches the floor.\nHave the student articulate with the down and up position of the foot.\nProceed to written rhythms as they begin to read music.\nAlways practice this entire routine.  The student must always go through the entire process, so he will not lose the ability to move his tongue at various speeds and in structured manners."

    "text": "TRUMPET GENERAL TUNING TENDENCIES\nThe Overtone Series\nThere are 7 possible combinations of fingerings:\nOpen\n2\n1\n1-2 (3rd valve alone is about the same length)\n2-3\n1-3\n1-2-3\nEach one plays a series of slotted notes. Displayed below are all the possible notes that can be played while pressing no valves down (open).\nThe lowest note is not stable, but technically exists. This note is easier to hit on the flugelhorn and cornet than it is on the trumpets. However, because it does not concern trumpet tuning tendencies, we will consider the middle C to be the lowest note.\nThe order of valve combinations listed above will lower every note on the staff by a half-step. 2nd valve’s lowest note would be a B, 1st valve’s a Bb, etc…\nBecause each overtone series is in tune with itself, switching between all 7 will cause tuning tendencies.\nTo overcome a tuning tendency, the following can be done:\nVowel shape/air direction adjustment\nValve slide adjustment\nAlternate fingering\nBefore going over which adjustment should be used when, it is important to go over the specific tuning tendencies.\nSharp Notes\nFlat Notes\nVowel Shape/Air Direction\nVowel shape/air direction is the most common adjustment that will be made with younger students.\nFor the upper register:\nStudents who are above pitch or have a pinched/strident sound are most likely closing their teeth. Remind students that even when making an “ee” vowel shape in the upper register, there should be space between the back teeth.\nStudents who are below pitch or have a weak/unsupported sound are most likely not using fast enough air or their tongue is not arched enough (“ee” vowel shape).\nFor the lower register:\nStudents who are above pitch or have a pinched/thin sound are most likely not playing with a big enough vowel shape. Ask students to drop their jaws and blow warm, calm air through the space between their teeth.\nStudents who are below pitch or have a sagging/dull sound are most likely letting their corner collapse and/or not keeping their corners firm. Remind students that even a relaxed vowel shape and air stream are supported by the same embouchure used to play a concert F.\nThe middle register is a good place for students to practice their flexibility within a note. Create games and exercises for students to manipulate which direction they blow their air (up/down) and the vowel shape they use to change the pitch of a note (while maintaining a characteristic sound).\nTo bend a note up, blow the air higher into the mouthpiece and make the vowel shape smaller.\nTo bend a note down, blow the air lower into the mouthpiece and make the vowel shape bigger.\nEncourage students to perform the aforementioned adjustments on both the mouthpiece alone and on the instrument.\nValve Slide Adjustment\nThe two slides that a student can adjust while he/she is playing are the 1st and 3rd valve slide.\nRule of thumb: If a note is sharp, AND the student is making a characteristic and resonant sound, the corresponding slide should be kicked out.\nThe pitch of second space A, fingered 1-2, can be lowered by kicking out the first valve slide.\nThe pitch of below-the-staff D, fingered 1-3, is not in tune unless the 3rd valve slide is kicked.\nThe pitch of below-the-staff C#, fingered 1-2-3, is not in tune unless the 3rd valve slide is kicked. This note needs more 3rd valve slide kicked out than below the staff D.\nTeach both D and C# as 1-3 trigger (referring to the kicking out of the 3rd valve slide) and 1-2-3 trigger.\nIf a student is not using any alternate fingerings, the 3rd valve slide should not be utilized on any other note. Most valve combinations including the 3rd valve are either in tune or have a flat tendency.\nThere are many notes with sharp tendencies that involve the 1st valve. Because of this, students should learn how to kick out the 1st valve slide at different lengths.\nAlternate Fingerings\nUsing the overtone series, one can find more options that are not specifically listed.\n1-2-3 for 4th space E\n1 for above the staff C\n1-3 for above the staff G\n2 for above the staff A\nThat being said, a band director should only know these fingerings if all else fails. Most alternate fingerings, especially higher notes using more valves than required, will dull the sound and drastically change the pitch. There will be occasions where a student brings his/her own trumpet with very different tuning tendencies and needs an uncommon option.\nWhen it comes to trills, alternate fingerings are completely acceptable. Students should learn that a G#-A trill is easier and cleaner to execute using 3rd valve instead of 1st and 2nd for the A.\nAt the high school level, it is more than acceptable to try fingerings that either darken or brighten the tone for chord balance purposes. This is why many professionals will simply play an above the staff A 3rd valve when playing in an F major chord."

    "text": "TRUMPET FACE/EMBOUCHURE\nEach student should use their own “safe/unbreakable” mirror—both in the classroom and at home.\nUsing the mirror, have each student notice how natural their face looks.  They will have to later remember and memorize how it looks and feels.\nThe head must be balanced on the shoulders in a comfortable position—not too far forward and not too far backward.\nThe eyes should be soft and natural, and the “sight line” should be exactly level.  The distance between eyebrows should not change as air goes in and out of the body.\nLook for natural creases in the face, and allow any that are naturally present to exist while playing.  No other creases are allowed.\nThe corners should move in toward the canine/eye teeth.  The corners should never look or feel pulled back.\nThe corners can move down from the natural position as the student progresses but they can never move up.\nThe texture of both the upper and lower lip should be very soft and relaxed.\nThere should be natural space between the inside of the lips and the gums and teeth.  This space should not change or feel different when the lips vibrate inside the cup of the mouthpiece.\nThe back teeth are slightly apart and should feel the same as when the student is reading, watching television, etc.  The teeth should not be pressed into each other when doing these other activities.\nBrass instrument embouchures are formed with a natural overbite.  A student with an underbite should be steered away from brass instrument.\nThe thickness of a student’s lips should correspond to the size of the cup of the mouthpiece for the chosen instrument.  Students with a very full top or bottom lip should be steered towards low brass instruments rather than trumpet.\nThe bottom of the front of the tongue should lie in the soft tissue area which is located in the front of the mouth just behind the ridge of the bottom gum.\nRemember that when playing the trumpet, cheeks will only “puff out” if the air is not freely going into the instrument.\nAssuming that the above has been achieved, the embouchure will be formed with special attention to the following:\nThe mouthpiece must be placed in the middle of the mouth—up and down as well as side to side.\nThe corners are in their natural position and should be set against the canine/eye teeth.\nThe lips must be allowed to freely vibrate in response to the airstream rather than made to “buzz” in front of the airstream.\nThe lips must feel natural so that air can freely move past them—they must not be pulled back against the teeth or blown away from the teeth and gums.\nThe students should remember that the mouthpiece “gathers” the air—not the lips.\nThere must never be more energy placed against the upper lip than the lower lip; hence the instrument will angle slightly downwards."

A loosened\nleadpipe will cause the trumpet to slide too easily against the embouchure when applying the\npressure necessary to play the instrument.\n  When tuning the instrument, always loosen/fasten the trumpet leadpipe. Do not cut corners\nand try to play the instrument while adjusting the slide. Not only can the instrument slide into\nthe embouchure, but it is very hard to play the instrument while adjusting the length of the\ntrumpet.\n  Tuning notes are 3rd space C, 2nd line G, middle C and below the staff D (if trumpet has 4\nvalves).\n  Most musicians will use “the A side” of the horn when playing in key signatures (concert\npitch) with sharps (G, D, A, E…) as the transposed key adds 3 flats (Bb, F, C, G…).\n  These keys will mainly be found in baroque music such as Music for the Royal Fireworks by\nGeorge Frideric Handel and Trumpet Voluntary by Jeremiah Clark.\n  If playing in key signatures (concert pitch) with flats (F, Bb, Eb, Ab…), musicians will use\n“the Bb side” as the transposed key adds 2 sharps (D, C, F, Bb…).\n  These keys will mainly be found in orchestral or pop music such as Petrouchka by Igor\nStravinsky and Penny Lane by The Beatles.\n  When playing in the key of concert C, it is up to the performer which side he/she will play on.\nIt is more common that they choose the Bb side due to easier trills (especially on scale degrees\n4 and 7).\n  The trumpet either has 3 or 4 valves. If it has 4 valves, the fingerings are identical to a\neuphonium (a D on this trumpet and a C on the euphonium are both fingered 4th valve; a C#\non this trumpet and a B on the euphonium are both fingered 2nd and 4th valve). Because the 4th\nvalve is not quickly adjustable like the 1st and 3rd valve slides, it is important to set the 4th\nvalve slide by tuning below the staff D. European countries prefer rotary valves similar to\nthose found on a French horn.\n  The piccolo trumpet uses a trumpet mouthpiece. Depending on the brand of piccolo trumpet,\nsuch as “Schilke”, some might use a cornet mouthpiece.\n  The most common mouthpiece associated with this trumpet is a Bach 7EW.\n  The piccolo trumpet is not to be used by a MS/JH or HS student, as it is a novelty instrument\nmainly used in brass ensembles. It is not recommend to allow students to practice on a piccolo\ntrumpet because it plays very differently from the larger trumpets and can begin to affect the\nestablished sounds made on a Bb trumpet if not carefully monitored.\n  Pitched in Eb; reads a fourth lower than a Bb trumpet or a minor 3rd below concert pitch\n  Sounds a perfect fourth higher than the Bb trumpet\n  Easily identified by the leadpipe leading directly into the third valve casing\n  Because the leadpipe must remain relatively short and close to the instrument, the trumpet\ncomes with what is called a “tuning bell”. Some brands will mimic the piccolo trumpet and\nhave crooks instead of bells.\n  Like the piccolo trumpet, the Eb trumpet comes with an Eb bell and a D bell.\n  The D bell is pitched in D and reads a major 3rd lower than Bb trumpet or a major 2nd below\nconcert pitch.\nIt sounds a major 3rd higher than the Bb trumpet.\n\n  To keep the instrument in tune with itself, one will also find 1st, 2nd, and 3rd valve slides\nassociated with each side of the trumpet. They are usually kept in small plastic bags and\nuniquely identified by a small “Eb” or “D” engraved on each of the slides.\n  Like the wing nut on a piccolo trumpet, there will either be one or two fasteners to attach the\nbell to the remainder of the trumpet. If they are not properly fastened, there is a risk of the\nbell falling off while playing.\n  As mentioned while tuning the piccolo trumpet, do not try to move the bell while playing.\n  Tuning notes are 3rd space C and 2nd line G (and additionally middle C for professional\nplayers).\n  Tuning tendencies are very different from a Bb trumpet. Most E-flat trumpets, especially\nSchilkes, have very long 1st valve slides, making 2nd space A’s and below the staff D’s in\ntune, but 1st line F’s and 4th line D’s flat.\n  Not used as often as the piccolo trumpet as most music played on an Eb/D trumpet can also\nbe played on a Bb/C trumpet, respectively\n  Literature selections include Trumpet Concerto in Eb by Joseph Haydn, Trumpet Concerto in\nE major (usually arranged and performed in Eb) by Johann Nepomuk Hummel and Mass in\nB minor (D trumpet) by Johann Sebastian Bach\n  Like the piccolo trumpet, it is not recommend to introduce this instrument to pre-college\nstudents. None of the standard band literature requires students to know this instrument and\nthe only time one will find an Eb part is either in a military band, a brass band or the\noccasional college marching band if still using military band orchestration.\n  Pitched in C; reads concert pitch (non-transposing)\n  Sounds a major 2nd higher than the Bb trumpet\nplayers)\n  Europeans will use rotary valves over piston valves to acquire a bigger and darker sound.\n  These trumpets are more commonly found in a professional orchestra. While some high\nschools allow their students to use these trumpets, it is recommended that the following\ncriterion are fulfilled:\n  Every student in the section has both a Bb trumpet and a C trumpet.\n  Every student in the section is taking private lessons with a teacher who is both\nfamiliar with the horn and can teach transposition.\n  They are only to be played if the whole section agrees.\n  They are either played on every piece in a performance or none of the pieces. Do\nnot mix and match.\n  Students have demonstrated equal or greater proficiency than their skills on a Bb\n  Students still spend time practicing on their Bb trumpet\n  Because the above mentioned requirements are usually not fulfilled until the college level, it\nis not recommended to utilize C trumpets. While the C trumpet plays near identical to the Bb\ntrumpet, the hassle is far too great for the desired outcome.\n  Pitched in Bb; reads a major 2nd above concert pitch\n  Sounds a major 2nd below concert pitch\n  If a student is started on a cornet, they “step-up” to a Bb trumpet\n  Most commonly used in MS/JH and HS\n  Uses a cornet mouthpiece (the leadpipe is smaller, requiring a smaller shank to fit it)\n  Creates a very different sound due to its conical bell (similar to the French horn and tuba)\n  Some beginners are started on a cornet and eventually “step-up” to a Bb trumpet\n  Very good to have in HS inventory as it can be used in very popular band literature (3 cornet\nparts, 2 trumpet parts)\n  Most commonly used in MS/JH\n  Uses a flugelhorn mouthpiece – not a trumpet mouthpiece)\n  Like the cornet, it uses a conical bell\n  Because the leadpipe leads directly into the valve casing, the flugelhorn uses a leadpipe tuning\nslide (similar to the piccolo trumpet).\n  Used in very few concert pieces, but almost necessary in every other jazz ballad\n  During marching season, some band directors prefer the use of a flugelhorn solo during a\nslower/lyrical section of the performance.\n  Only to be used by HS students who are very proficient in their Bb trumpet skills\n  Recommended to keep 2 in stock at the HS level\n  Simply put, it is a Bb trumpet with an elongated bell.\n  This trumpet has no use in a non-professional setting, as it is only used in organized groups\n(U.S. Army Herald Trumpets).\nUNIQUE VARIATIONS OF THE TRUMPET\nTypes of Valves\n  Rotary\n  Found on Bb, C, and piccolo trumpets\n  Standard European style of trumpet\n  Piston\n  Used on every American trumpet\n\nInvented by the French; best choice when playing etudes\nTypes of Tuning slides\n  Conventional\n  Tuning slide fits into leadpipe\n  The most common in trumpets\n  Reverse\n  Leadpipe slides into tuning slide\n  Offers less resistance\n  Requires more endurance\n  Leadpipe\nInserted into the trumpet’s leadpipe from the embouchure end\n  Mouthpiece is then inserted into the leadpipe’s mouthpiece receiver\n  Found on flugelhorns and piccolo trumpets\n  Bell\n  Adjusted from where the bend of the bell meets the pipe exiting the first valve\ncasing\n  Found on Eb/D trumpets\nTypes of valve slide adjustors\n  Saddle\n  Found on the first valve slide\n  The most common first valve slide adjustor\n  Ring\n  Found on both the first valve slide and the third valve slide\n  The most common third valve slide adjustor\n  Not uncommon to find beginner trumpets that have adjustable rings attached to\nthe third valve slide\n  Trigger\n  The least common of both valve slide adjustors\n  Found on older models and unpopular ones\n  Functions by pressing the vertical lever into the valve casing, pushing out the\nslide to a set distance\n  The distance the slide moves after pressing the trigger can be adjusted (when the\ninstrument is not being played); therefore, the trigger is not recommended as\ndifferent notes require different distances (low C# requires more 3rd valve slide\nthan below the staff D and above the staff A requires more 1st valve slide than 5th\nline F).\nRECOMMENDED\nTRUMPET/CORNET/FLUGELHORN BRANDS\nTrumpets/Cornets:\nBeginner:\nBrand: Yamaha\nModel: YTR-2330\nPricing: MSRP $1,233.00 - $1,383.00 @\nwwbw.com\nDescription:\n  Student-owned instrument\n  Yellow brass bell/leadpipe\n  .459” bore\n  Monel valves\n  #1 recommended beginner trumpet\nModel: YCR-2330II\nPricing: MSRP $1,149.99 @ wwbw.com\n  .462” bore\n  Nickel-plated Valves\n  #1 recommended beginner cornet\nIntermediate:\nModel: YTR-4335GII Intermediate\nPricing: MSRP $1,474.99 - $1,624.99 @\n  Great middle/high school trumpet\n  Gold brass bell\n  Yellow brass body\nBrand: Bach\nModel: TR200 Series\nPricing: MSRP $1,919.00 - $2,059.00 @\n  Yellow brass bell\n  Lacquer finish\nProfessional:\nModel: 180S37\nPricing: MSRP $2,759.00 - $2,879.00 @ wwbw.com\n  The professional pick of all Bach trumpets\n  Used for orchestral playing\n  Yellow/gold brass bell\n  Silver finish\nModel: YTR-8335 Xeno Series\nPricing: MSRP $2,417.99 - $2,567.99 @\n  Most cost effective trumpet for high\nschool students\n  Slightly heavier\nModel: YTR-9335CHS Xeno Chicago Artist\nSeries\nPricing: MSRP $4,651.99 @ wwbw.com\n  Very common orchestral trumpet\n  Created with the input of John\nHagstrom, the 2nd trumpet in the CSO\n(Chicago Symphony Orchestra)\n  Incredible projection\nModel: YTR-9335NYSII Xeno New York\nArtist Series\n  Created with the input of David Bilger,\nprincipal trumpet in the PSO\n(Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra)\nFlugelhorns:\nBrand: Conn\nModel: 1FR Vintage One Series\nPricing: MSRP $2,429.00 - $2,549.00 @\n  School-owned instrument\n  6” hand-hammered one-piece rose brass bell\n  .413” bore\nModel: YFH-8310Z Custom Z Series\nPricing: MSRP $2,739.99 - $2,916.99 @\n  6” yellow brass bell\n  Gold brass leadpipe\nRECOMMENDED TRUMPET MOUTHPIECES\nModel: 7C\nPricing: MSRP $56.00 @ wwbw.com\n  A beginner’s first mouthpiece\n  Medium-small cup size\n  Fits the smaller embouchure of a 6th grade\nstudent\nModel: 3C\n  Great for middle school/junior high and\nhigh school students\n  Used as a step-up mouthpiece for\ngraduating 8th grade students\n  Medium cup size\nModel: 1½C\n  The most common mouthpiece found in\nprofessional orchestras\n  Used as a step-up mouthpiece for graduating high school students who plan\nto study music\n  For players with larger lips, this cup size might open up a “tight” sound.\n  Large cup size\nTRUMPET MOUTHPIECE INFORMATION\nFactors to consider when looking at a mouthpiece\n  A trumpet mouthpiece will not fit a cornet sized leadpipe and a vice versa.\nIf the instrument has a small bore (.425 and smaller) consider using a mouthpiece with a\nbigger cup/cup diameter or a looser throat/backbore\nIf the instrument has a large bore (.460 and larger) consider using a mouthpiece with a\nsmaller cup/cup diameter or a tighter throat/backbore\n  The above mouthpiece recommendations are used to compensate for “the blow”, or\nresistance, of the instrument. A trumpet with too much resistance will cause false security\nin note accuracy and constrict the sound. A trumpet with too little resistance will require\nmore effort and quickly wear out a player.\n  Because mouthpiece adaptations can become expensive, it is recommended that the\nprivate lesson teacher holds the decision to move a student to a uniquely tailored\nmouthpiece.\nBasic terminology\n  Bore size refers to the instrument you are playing, not the mouthpiece. The bore size is\nthe inside diameter of the leadpipe. Small bore trumpets are typically .410-.425 inch and\nlarge bore trumpets are typically .460-.470 inch.\n  Cornet shank mouthpieces refer to mouthpieces that can fit on a cornet or certain\npiccolo trumpets; these shanks are smaller than trumpet shanks.\n  Trumpet shank mouthpieces refer to mouthpieces that can fit on a trumpet. This is your\ntypical shank size and will fit on almost every instrument of the trumpet family.\n  Cup Size refers to the depth/shallowness of the empty space inside the cup.\n  Cup diameter refers to the width of the space stretching from one side of the inner rim to\nthe opposite side.\n  Throat refers to the small section right after the cup ends. This is not where students hold\nthe mouthpiece.\n  Backbore refers to the space inside the shank of the mouthpiece. This is where students\nhold the mouthpiece.\n  Rim refers to the flat or rounded surface that makes contact with the embouchure.\nSilver vs. gold plating\n  There has been much controversy surrounding the issue of playing on silver-plated or\ngold-plated mouthpieces. These issues include the following:\n  Endurance\n  Tone quality\n  Ease of playing\n  Overall embouchure health\n  So what is the truth? Because the embouchure is incredibly personal and can only be\ntruly determined and developed on an individual level, the issue, as a whole, does not\nreally matter. Students will discover what works best for them as they develop, and they\nshould only do so under the supervision of an experienced band director and/or private\nlesson instructor.\nIt is recommended to start beginners on a silver mouthpiece. A silver mouthpiece is\ncheaper, and because it is uncertain whether or not the student will have embouchure\nissues on the onset, there is no need to have students start on a gold mouthpiece (which is\ntwice as expensive).\nPARTS OF THE TRUMPET MOUTHPIECE\nSPECTRUM OF A TRUMPET MOUTHPIECE\nTRUMPET MAINTENANCE KIT –\nRECCOMMENDED ITEMS\nAl Cass Fast Valve Slide\nand Key Oil – 2 oz bottle\nMSRP $6.59 @ wwbw.com\n  Students should oil valves\nat least once a week\nLa Tromba T2 Valve Oil\nMSRP $7.95 @ dillonmusic.com\n  Slightly more expensive\n  Provides better\nperformance for Monel and\nsteel piston valves\nOR\nBlue Juice Valve Oil\nMSRP $4.99 @ wwbw.com\n  A cheaper alternative that\nprovides sufficient success\n  Do not use in extreme\nweather conditions\n(marching band season) or\nthe valves will accumulate\ngunky deposits.\nYamaha LVO Light\nSuperior Valve Oil Light\nMSRP $6.99 @ wwbw.com\n  A synthetic oil that prevents\nresidue build up on valves in\nthe long run.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nDenis Wick Trumpet/Cornet\nSnake Brush Standard\nMSRP $10.99 @ wwbw.com\n  A snake is used to clean the inner\nand outer slides at least every six\nmonths\n  Be sure to not use metal snakes,\nas they will scratch the plating of\nthe horn.\nYamaha Brass Mouthpiece\nBrush\nMSRP $2.25 @ wwbw.com\n  Used to clean the inside of the\nmouthpiece\nInsert from the shank and twist to\nclean out the mouthpiece\n  Does not go all the way through\nthe mouthpiece\n  Could scratch the inside of the cup\nof the mouthpiece if not used\ncorrectly\nCheesecloth\nMSRP $3.99 @ bedbathandbeyond.com\n  Used to wipe down the inner\nslide of the valve slides (when\napplying new grease)\n  Used to wipe down the piston\nsection of the valves (when\napplying new oil)\nLeblanc Polishing Cloth\n  A lacquer polishing cloth is very\nhelpful in the maintenance of any\ninstrument.

Take a mouthpiece brush and run it through the mouthpiece under warm water in\nthe sink.\n  The brush will not go all the way through, so insert the brush to the throat,\ntwist and pull out.\n  Soap is not necessary, but it does not hurt the mouthpiece to use it. The\nsame goes for mouthwash. If these are used, simply rinse the mouthpiece\nthoroughly afterwards and let it air dry so that the alcohol evaporates.\n  This process should be done every week to two weeks.\nSlide Maintenance\n  The insides of the slides and various tubes build up grime, various dirt particles, and\ngerms, so the slides must be snaked at least once a month.\n  To snake a horn:\n1.  Take out the appropriate slide, pressing down the appropriate valve while taking it\nout, and place the slide on a towel or soft surface.\n2.  Run water through the unattached slide, preferably in the opposite direction of air\nflow.\nIn the case of the main tuning slide and the lead pipe, also run water\nthrough the lead pipe – starting on the end with the tuning slide, not the\nend with the mouthpiece receiver.\n3.  Take the snake and run it through the slide which was taken out, preferably in the\nopposite direction of air flow.\n4.  Repeat the above step on the immovable part of the slide attached to the rotor. Be\ncareful to not jam the snake against the 3rd valve piston.\n5.  Repeat the above two steps with all slides, including the main tuning slide, the 1st\nvalve slide, 2nd valve slide, and 3rd valve slide\n6.  Apply slide grease as necessary according to the below steps.\n  There are 4 slides on the trumpet. Each of these must be well-lubricated with slide grease.\nRefer to the “Maintenance Kit” handout for pictures of slide greases.\n  To apply the grease:\n1.  Take out the slide to be greased, pressing down the appropriate valve.\n2.  With some cheesecloth, wipe off the slide to clean the grease and any grime on\nthe slide.\n3.  If the grease is a liquid, squeeze the bottle and apply a line of grease down two\nsides of the slide. If the grease is more of a cream, use the index finger to apply\nthe grease along most of the length of the slide.\n  Do not apply too much grease, as the slides can become too lubricated and\nfall out.\n4.  Re-insert the slide and slide it fully in and out a few times. Insert only one side of\nthe slide in and rotate the slide while moving it in and out. Press down the\nappropriate valve the entire time during this process.\n5.  Push the slide all the way in and use a paper towel to wipe off any extra grease\nlocated where the immovable and movable parts of the slide meet.\n6.  Repeat this process for all slides as needed.\n7.  Apply 1-2 drops of valve oil onto the inner slides of the 1st valve slide (make sure\nthe valve is held down during this part as mentioned earlier).\n8.  Moving the slide in and out, the oil should thin out the grease and cause the slide\nto become very responsive.\n9.  Wipe down the greasy solution that collects where the immovable and movable\nparts of the slide meet.\n10. Repeat steps 7-9 for the 3rd valve slide.\n  This process should be done every month or so.\nValve Maintenance\nIf consistently played on, a trumpet should have no “sticky valves” for a month.\n  On the other hand, a trumpet that is not played on for 2-3 days in a row can begin to\nbecome less responsive.\n  To re-oil the valves:\n1.  Begin twisting from the top valve cap until the cap comes off of the valve casing.\n2.  Holding the valve by the finger button, completely remove the valve without\ntwisting or rotating it inside the casing.\n3.  With some cheesecloth, wipe down any old oil from the piston.\n4.  Apply a healthy coat of oil on the whole piston, but do not intentionally apply any\noil inside the ports as it will simply go to waste once air is blown through the\nhorn.\n5.  Take a look inside the valve casing:\n  There should be two notches on the sides of the valve casing; this is where\nthe guides on the valve will be placed.\n  One notch should be slightly bigger/different from the other one. Be sure\nto align the correct guide with the correct slot.\n6.  Carefully insert the valve, without twisting or rotating it, inside the appropriate\nvalve casing.\n7.  Repeat for any other “sticky” valves.\nTRUMPET METHOD BOOKS\nEssential Elements 2000\nMSRP $8.99\n@ wwbw.com\nStandard of Excellence\nMSRP $6.95\nBest in Class\nMSRP $5.45\nAccent on Achievement\nMSRP $7.95\nSUPPLEMENTAL TRUMPET BOOKS\nComplete Conservatory\nMethod for Trumpet by\nJean Baptiste Arban (New\nAuthentic Edition)\nMSRP $25.05\n@ musiciansfriend.com\nTechnical Studies for the\nCornet by Herbert Lincoln\nClarke\nMSRP $16.99\nThe “must have” book for\nevery trumpet player\nContatins every technique\nnecessary to master the\ninstrument\nLesson teachers will ask\ntheir students to buy it.\nContains etudes that may\nbe used for TMEA All-\nState trumpet music\nThe second most\nimportant book to have\nContains flow studies that\nencourage continuous air\nstreams while building\ntechnique\nStudents should own it,\nbut older editions can be\nfound on imslp.org.\nFirst Book of Practical\nStudies for Cornet and\nTrumpet by Robert W.\nGetchell edited by Nilo W.\nHovey\nMSRP $7.99\nContains music that\nbeginners could read with\na private instructor\nProfessionals play these\nstudies in their warm-up,\nat very soft dynamics, to\nhelp with response issues.\n40 Studies for Trumpet by\nWilhelm Wurm\nMSRP $14.25\n@ jwpepper.com\nSelected Studies for Cornet\nor Trumpet by Himie\nVoxman\nMSRP $7.19\n@ grothmusic.com\n34 Studies for Trumpet by\nVassily Brandt edited by\nRobert Nagel\nMSRP $11.25\n@ sheetmusicplus.com\nOlder editions can be\nSaint-Jacome’s Grand\nMethod for Trumpet or\nCornet by Louis A.

Identify these marks, and\ntheir relationship to the top and bottom of the case.  Most cases have the handles placed\non the bottom section of each case.  Check to make sure.\n  Place all trumpet cases on the floor in front of the student.\n  Be sure the student understands where and which direction each part of the instrument\nbelongs in the case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.\nMake sure the student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure the\nparts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse order they were removed.\n  The trumpet should be removed first, followed by the mouthpiece.  When putting\ninstrument back, the order is reversed – mouthpiece first, followed by the trumpet.\n  All instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure explicitly\nevery time.\n  Never leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up, but this is\nnot always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.  Check each opening\nmechanism carefully before presenting the information to your students.\n  Cases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom setup for\neach student’s case.  If using an ensemble room for the class, the cases may be opened in\nthe hall.  The empty case will remain closed and latched in the hall during class.\n  When instruments are in their cases, do not allow students to sit on their cases AT ANY\nTIME because the lead pipe or bell will get bent.\nPARTS OF THE TRUMPET\nPARTS OF THE TRUMPET VALVE\nTRUMPET ASSEMBLY, HAND POSITION AND\nINSTRUMENT/BODY RATIO\nAssembly\n  Place the case on the floor. Most latches on trumpet cases face up.\n  Open the case and make sure that both the horn and the mouthpiece are secure.\n  Remove the trumpet with your left hand and grasp from the valve casing. If the trumpet is\ncorrectly positioned in the case, it should be held with the side facing upward.\n  Holding the trumpet in the left hand, carefully remove the mouthpiece with the right\nhand.\n  Seat the mouthpiece gently into the leadpipe, and rotate 2/3 of a turn for a friction grip.\nInstrument/Body Ratio\n  Assuming that the student is either standing or sitting with correct posture, instruct them\nto pick up the body of the trumpet with both hands and simply lift it by using their\nelbows.  Move the instrument up and down, side to side, higher than usual and lower than\nusual.  As students are doing this, have them notice how it affects the balance of the\nbody.  Eventually, the body should feel as balanced with or without the instrument in\nHand Position\n1.  The most natural shape of everyone’s hands forms a “flat-C.”\n2.  All hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall behind the\nwrist.\n3.  There should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the trumpet.\n4.  The inside of the arm must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding the\ntrumpet correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\n5.  Elbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be\nhampered.\n6.  Place both the left and the right hand in their correct position.  Remember the left hand\ndoes not “grip” the instrument.  No tension should be felt in this hand when holding the\ninstrument.\n7.  The right thumb is placed in its natural position, which is between the first and second\nvalve casing.  The thumb must never bend in any direction!  The index, middle and ring\nfingers are curved and the fleshy part of the fingertips is placed on the pearls of the valve\ncaps and should never lose contact with the caps.  The pinky is slightly curved and placed\non TOP of the “ring.”  This pinky should never be placed INSIDE the “ring”, as this will\ncause students to “pull” the instrument into their embouchure and cause major problems.\n8.  Though not a part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling the\ninstrument toward the student’s face.  Instruct students to keep their elbows soft while\nplaying the trumpet.\n9.  The palms of both hands should feel soft.  The palm of the right hand should never touch\nthe instrument.  The teacher should be able to clearly see a “circular” opening between\nthe right hand and the instrument.\n10. The student should understand that finger movement is aided by the soft tissue of the\npalm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand.\nTRUMPET FACE/EMBOUCHURE\n  Each student should use their own “safe/unbreakable” mirror—both in the classroom and\nat home.\n  Using the mirror, have each student notice how natural their face looks.  They will have\nto later remember and memorize how it looks and feels.\n  The head must be balanced on the shoulders in a comfortable position—not too far\nforward and not too far backward.\n  The eyes should be soft and natural, and the “sight line” should be exactly level.  The\ndistance between eyebrows should not change as air goes in and out of the body.\n  Look for natural creases in the face, and allow any that are naturally present to exist\nwhile playing.  No other creases are allowed.\n  The corners should move in toward the canine/eye teeth.  The corners should never look\nor feel pulled back.\n  The corners can move down from the natural position as the student progresses but they\ncan never move up.\n  The texture of both the upper and lower lip should be very soft and relaxed.\n  There should be natural space between the inside of the lips and the gums and teeth.  This\nspace should not change or feel different when the lips vibrate inside the cup of the\n  The back teeth are slightly apart and should feel the same as when the student is reading,\nwatching television, etc.  The teeth should not be pressed into each other when doing\nthese other activities.\n  Brass instrument embouchures are formed with a natural overbite.  A student with an\nunderbite should be steered away from brass instrument.\n  The thickness of a student’s lips should correspond to the size of the cup of the\nmouthpiece for the chosen instrument.  Students with a very full top or bottom lip should\nbe steered towards low brass instruments rather than trumpet.\n  The bottom of the front of the tongue should lie in the soft tissue area which is located in\nthe front of the mouth just behind the ridge of the bottom gum.\n  Remember that when playing the trumpet, cheeks will only “puff out” if the air is\nnot freely going into the instrument.\n  Assuming that the above has been achieved, the embouchure will be formed with special\nattention to the following:\n1.  The mouthpiece must be placed in the middle of the mouth—up and down as\nwell as side to side.\n2.  The corners are in their natural position and should be set against the\ncanine/eye teeth.\n3.  The lips must be allowed to freely vibrate in response to the airstream rather\nthan made to “buzz” in front of the airstream.\n4.  The lips must feel natural so that air can freely move past them—they must\nnot be pulled back against the teeth or blown away from the teeth and gums.\n5.  The students should remember that the mouthpiece “gathers” the air—not the\nlips.\n6.  There must never be more energy placed against the upper lip than the lower\nlip; hence the instrument will angle slightly downwards.\nTRUMPET ARTICULATION\n  The  tongue  moves  in  the  same  manner  when  articulating  a  brass  instrument  as  it  does\nwhen  you  speak.   The  tongue  moves  up  and  down—not  back  and  forth—both  when\nspeaking and when articulation on an instrument.\n  The purpose of the tongue is to release the air which causes the lips to vibrate and creates\nthe  sound.   The  tongue’s  release  of  the  air  simply  defines  the  beginning/start  of  the\nvibration/sound.\n  Articulation is used to define the vibrations necessary to create musical rhythm, style and\nmovement--to contrast the use of slurring (which also creates similar musical entities).\n  The students should think that the tongue “articulates” the sound created by the\nairstream.  If the student is taught to create the sound correctly, articulation will be an\neasy transition.\na.\nb.\nc.\nsound occurs when the air moves past the naturally vibrating lips\narticulate the sound that is already present\nteach students to articulate at the moment the sound begins\n  Without the instrument or mouthpiece, use the following procedure:\n1.  Say the word “DOG”.\n2.  Sing the syllable “DAH”.\n3.  Once these are mastered, have the student use the mouthpiece and instrument and\nreproduce the “DAH” syllable in their brain to create an articulated sound.\n4.  The tongue should feel the same when saying, singing and playing the\nmouthpiece and instrument.\n5.  The tongue should touch the enamel of the upper teeth directly below the gum\nline—in the same spot with the same strength every time.\n6.  Use the syllable “DAH” because it creates smoother and more easily controlled\nair as opposed to the “TAH” syllable.\n7.  After each “articulation”, the tongue must immediately fall down into its natural\n“at rest” position.\n8.  The tongue will be naturally soft at all times, but can touch the teeth with different\nstrengths.\n9.  The tongue will be in its “down position” 98% of the time when articulating\ncorrectly.\n  Have the student start their sound with the air.\n  Using the information about the basics of articulation, have the student articulate as fast\nas they can with no limitations of numbers, worries about evenness of articulation,\netc.  Simply get them used to articulating!\n  Have the student then use the “ta-day” syllable to practice using the tongue in an\norganized manner.\n  Have the student then articulate “on command.”  The student will start their sound, and\narticulate when you snap your fingers to practice gaining more control of the tongue.\n  Once the student understands pulse and the foot pat, have the student articulate exactly\nwhen the toe of the foot touches the floor.\n  Have the student articulate with the down and up position of the foot.\n  Proceed to written rhythms as they begin to read music.\nAlways practice this entire routine.  The student must always go through the entire\nprocess, so he will not lose the ability to move his tongue at various speeds and in\nstructured manners.\nTRUMPET FLEXIBILITY AND\nRANGE EXTENSION\n  Brass playing is based upon flexibility.\n  There are two types of flexibility: flexibility within the instrument and flexibility within\nthe note.\n  Students eventually need to be flexible through each of the harmonic series in order to\nmove up and down within the range of the instrument.\n  Once the student can reproduce at will a given pitch, the teacher must decide whether\nflexibility up or down is needed first.\nIt is important to remember that note flexibility is controlled by air direction and the\nisometrics created by the corners and canine/eye teeth. The head must always stay in its\nnatural, balanced position at all times.  The angle of the instrument must not change at\nany time.\n  Students must learn to angle the air in the cup of the mouthpiece without changing the\nposition of the lips and/or the relationship of the upper and lower teeth.\n  Flexibility is also enhanced by vowel sounds used in various registers.  These sounds can\nbe “ah” for the middle register….”ee” for the upper register….and “oh” for the lower\nregister.  Have students practice saying these vowel sounds with vocalization on\nappropriate lower, middle and higher sounds.\n  The speed of the air and the shape of the vowel guide flexibility. The tongue assists the\nair speed similar to the way one’s thumb assists the water speed from a hose. The tongue\nrelaxes when descending into the lower register and arches when ascending into the\nupper register.\n  Bring to the students’ attention that the shape of the tongue changes dramatically from\nvowel sound to vowel sound.  All students should be aware that vowel sounds are the\nmiddles of words that they speak every day.  Practice saying words that use the required\nvowel sounds. (i.e.  bow, ball, beep)\n  Range is developed through flexibility.  It is more important to create a resonant sound\nwhile practicing flexibility than to create wider intervals.  The student can enhance their\nrange by making more resonant sounds in the middle register before trying to extend\nhigher or lower.\n  While it is important to create resonant sounds in the register students can play in, it is\nimportant for students to occasionally try exploring both the upper and lower range they\nstruggle to make a good sound in. This should be practiced perhaps twice a week.\n  Make sure students understand the texture of the lips have nothing to do with range.  For\nexample, students should never be told to “tighten” their lips in order to play in the higher\nregister.\nTRUMPET GENERAL TUNING TENDENCIES\nThe Overtone Series\n  There are 7 possible combinations of fingerings:\n  Open\n  2\n  1\n  1-2 (3rd valve alone is about the same length)\n  2-3\n  1-3\n  1-2-3\n  Each one plays a series of slotted notes. Displayed below are all the possible notes that\ncan be played while pressing no valves down (open).\n  The lowest note is not stable, but technically exists. This note is easier to hit on the\nflugelhorn and cornet than it is on the trumpets. However, because it does not concern\ntrumpet tuning tendencies, we will consider the middle C to be the lowest note.\n  The order of valve combinations listed above will lower every note on the staff by a half-\nstep. 2nd valve’s lowest note would be a B, 1st valve’s a Bb, etc…\n  Because each overtone series is in tune with itself, switching between all 7 will cause\ntuning tendencies.\n  To overcome a tuning tendency, the following can be done:\n1.  Vowel shape/air direction adjustment\n2.  Valve slide adjustment\n3.  Alternate fingering\n  Before going over which adjustment should be used when, it is important to go over the\nspecific tuning tendencies.\n  Moderately sharp\n  More open vowel shape\n  Very hard note to keep in\ntune\n  Kick out 1st valve slide\n  When scales are learned\nand a good sound is\nestablished, teach 3rd valve\nSharp Notes\n  Slightly sharp\n  Do not use 3rd valve\n  Severely sharp\n  Taught to beginners as 1-2-\n3 and 3rd kick slide\n  Taught to beginners as 1-3\nand 3rd kick slide\n  Readjust tuning slide if\nnote is still sharp\n  Moderately flat\n  Supported air stream\n  1-2 alternative; sound is\ndarker/duller\n  1-2-3 alternative; sound\nis darker/duller\nbrighter/strident\nFlat Notes\n  Check to make sure the\nembouchure is not\ncoming apart\n  Slightly flat\n  Check to make sure\nstudents are not kicking\n3rd valve slide\n  Severely flat\n  Lip up/blow air up\n  “ee” vowel over “ah”\nuntil note flexibility\nimproves\n  1-3 alternative, but sound\nsuffers\n  2-3 alternative; sound is\nVowel Shape/Air Direction\n  Vowel shape/air direction is the most common adjustment that will be made with\nyounger students.\n  For the upper register:\n  Students who are above pitch or have a pinched/strident sound are most likely\nclosing their teeth. Remind students that even when making an “ee” vowel shape\nin the upper register, there should be space between the back teeth.\n  Students who are below pitch or have a weak/unsupported sound are most likely\nnot using fast enough air or their tongue is not arched enough (“ee” vowel shape).\n  For the lower register:\n  Students who are above pitch or have a pinched/thin sound are most likely not\nplaying with a big enough vowel shape. Ask students to drop their jaws and blow\nwarm, calm air through the space between their teeth.\n  Students who are below pitch or have a sagging/dull sound are most likely letting\ntheir corner collapse and/or not keeping their corners firm. Remind students that\neven a relaxed vowel shape and air stream are supported by the same embouchure\nused to play a concert F.\n  The middle register is a good place for students to practice their flexibility within a note.\nCreate games and exercises for students to manipulate which direction they blow their air\n(up/down) and the vowel shape they use to change the pitch of a note (while maintaining\na characteristic sound).\n  To bend a note up, blow the air higher into the mouthpiece and make the vowel\nshape smaller.\n  To bend a note down, blow the air lower into the mouthpiece and make the vowel\nshape bigger.\n  Encourage students to perform the aforementioned adjustments on both the\nmouthpiece alone and on the instrument.\nValve Slide Adjustment\n  The two slides that a student can adjust while he/she is playing are the 1st and 3rd valve\nslide.\n  Rule of thumb: If a note is sharp, AND the student is making a characteristic and\nresonant sound, the corresponding slide should be kicked out.\n  The pitch of second space A, fingered 1-2, can be lowered by kicking out the first\nvalve slide.\n  The pitch of below-the-staff D, fingered 1-3, is not in tune unless the 3rd valve\nslide is kicked.\n  The pitch of below-the-staff C#, fingered 1-2-3, is not in tune unless the 3rd valve\nslide is kicked. This note needs more 3rd valve slide kicked out than below the\nstaff D.\n  Teach both D and C# as 1-3 trigger (referring to the kicking out of the 3rd valve\nslide) and 1-2-3 trigger.\nIf a student is not using any alternate fingerings, the 3rd valve slide should not be\nutilized on any other note. Most valve combinations including the 3rd valve are\neither in tune or have a flat tendency.\n  There are many notes with sharp tendencies that involve the 1st valve. Because of\nthis, students should learn how to kick out the 1st valve slide at different lengths.\nAlternate Fingerings\n  Using the overtone series, one can find more options that are not specifically listed.\n  1-2-3 for 4th space E\n  1 for above the staff C\n  1-3 for above the staff G\n  2 for above the staff A\n  That being said, a band director should only know these fingerings if all else fails. Most\nalternate fingerings, especially higher notes using more valves than required, will dull the\nsound and drastically change the pitch. There will be occasions where a student brings\nhis/her own trumpet with very different tuning tendencies and needs an uncommon\noption.\n  When it comes to trills, alternate fingerings are completely acceptable. Students should\nlearn that a G#-A trill is easier and cleaner to execute using 3rd valve instead of 1st and 2nd\nfor the A.\n  At the high school level, it is more than acceptable to try fingerings that either darken or\nbrighten the tone for chord balance purposes. This is why many professionals will simply\nplay an above the staff A 3rd valve when playing in an F major chord.\nCORNET CLASS WARM-UP SHEET\n1\n(cid:5) (cid:19)(cid:19) (cid:84)\n(cid:5) (cid:84)\n2\n(cid:5)\n3\n(cid:84)\n(cid:5) (cid:199)\n(cid:5) (cid:199)(cid:64)\n4\n(cid:5) (cid:157)\n(cid:199)\n(cid:157)\n(cid:199)(cid:64)\n(cid:5) (cid:157)(cid:64)\n5\n(cid:157)(cid:64)\n(cid:84)(cid:64)\n(cid:135)\nCORNET/TRUMPET CHROMATIC\nDESCENDING/ASCENDING EXERCISES\n& 44 ˙\n˙b\n& ˙\n˙\n& ˙b\n&\n˙#\n& ˙#\nÓ\n˙n\n∑\nCORNET EXTENDED SLURS\n& 4\nœ\n& 44 œ\nœ œ œ œ œ œ œ œ\nœb\n& 44 œ œ œ œ œ œ œ œ\nw\n& œ\nCORNET CHRISTMAS TUNES\nJingle Bells\nGood King Wenceslas (lower)\nGood King Wenceslas (higher)\n4 œ"

This will\ndamage the reed.\nd.  Oil from the hands or nose can be rubbed on the heart of the reed\nto improve sound quality.\n•  Student can blow on the reed to check the quality. This is called “crowing”.\nOBOE HAND POSITION\nRight Hand Position\n1.  Place the right hand first, with the lower joint and bell supported by the\nleg.  The upper joint can be gently held by the left hand as you begin the\nawkward process of finding the correct place for every finger.\n2.  Place the fleshy finger pads over the keys first.  Without putting pressure\non the finger tips, be sure all holes are covered.\n3.  The hand will begin in a straight across angle, and will be in the “flat-C”\nposition.  Eventually, as with the clarinet, they will slant into the “V”\nposition.\n4.  Place the thumb on the thumb rest between the rest and the leg.  The\nthumb nail touches the rest. Very little (preferably, no) flesh will touch the\nthumb rest. The thumb joint must always be to the right of the thumb rest,\nnever behind it.\n5.  Turn the oboe out in front of the student like a spyglass and make sure\nthere is open space between the body of the oboe and the hand.\n6.  The little finger rests on the most comfortable home key it will use later in\nthis process.\n7.  The middle finger will appear higher because it is longer than the other\nfingers.\n8.  The middle finger should be very close to perpendicular to the joint.\n9.  No part of any finger should touch any rod.\n10. Practice moving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.  Do not\nlet the other two knuckles move.  The finger pads should fall directly into\nthe holes.  In the beginning the little finger can move up and down also.\n11. Lean the oboe back on the shoulder and look at the right hand fingers as\nyou do this.  While doing this, the left hand must remain in its proper\n“baby” position holding the upper joint.\n12. Saying “squeeze….release” for finger movement will help the fingers\nmove from the big knuckles and understand the “timing” of fingers.\n13. Make sure to feel all parts of the keys with the finger pads.\n14. Do not include side keys in the initial hand position information.  When\nasked by students,  tell them once the hands can move using the keys\ncorrectly, they will be allowed to use the keys on the side.\nLeft Hand Position\n1.  ALWAYS KEEP ONE HAND ON THE OBOE AT ALL TIMES.\nNEVER SIMPLY LAY IT IN THE LAP.\n2.  Keep the thumb perpendicular to the back of the instrument.\n3.  The middle knuckle of the index finger is placed over one of the octave\nkeys.\n4.  The fingers are slightly slanted downward.\n5.  Place the index, middle, and ring fingers on the keys with holes.\n6.  Beginners can have “fly-away” fingers in the beginning as long as they\nfall back down to the correct rings.  Always feel the palm of the hands to\ncheck for the softness of the fingers.  There are more bones in this area of\nthe hand than any other part of the body.  If the palm is soft, all other parts\nof the hand will be as naturally soft as is possible.  The little fingers should\nhave comfortable “home keys” they touch all of the time in the beginning\nstages.\n7.  Be patient with progress toward absolute correct hand position.  It is best\nto have “double jointed” students not play the oboe.\n8.  The body of the oboe is very small.  Hand position can feel very awkward.\nThe student should be made aware of the oboe’s double octave key system,\nand that the middle finger will appear higher because it is longer than the\nother fingers.\n10. Using the previously mentioned “squeeze….release” exercises, practice\nmoving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles.  Do not let the\nother two knuckles move.  The finger pads should fall directly into the\nholes.  In the beginning the little finger can move up and down also.\n11. Make sure to feel all parts of the keys with the finger pads.\n12. Do not include side keys in the initial hand position information.  When\nasked, tell students once their hands can move using the keys correctly,\nthey will be allowed to use the keys on the side.\nFinger Exercises\n1.  All fingers in each hand move together.  Call out the hand you wish to\nmove.  The students move all of the fingers in that hand down to seat into\nthe rings and tone holes.  The right hand thumb obviously does not ever\nmove when the teacher asks for “RIGHT,” but the left hand thumb can\nmove with the fingers of the left hand when needed as the teacher asks for\n“LEFT.”\n2.  Next, we move the fingers one at a time beginning with the left hand.  The\nthumb and first finger are already down in this exercise, and each\nadditional finger in both hands will be numbered two through six from top\nof the upper joint to the bottom of the lower joint. The fingers will move\ndown or up depending on their starting position, as the number is called by\nthe teacher.  We do not use the little fingers when we first begin this\nexercise.  Later, they will be numbered seven and eight.\n3.  Watch the fingers to see that they move smoothly, cover the holes, stay in\nnatural position and move up and down from the big knuckle only.\n4.  Next, we move the fingers in combinations: one, two….one, two\nthree…….one, two, three, four……one, two, three, four, five…..one, two,\nthree, four, five, six………six, five, four, three, two, one……five, four,\nthree, two, one…….four, three, two, one……three, two, one………two,\none……  Later in the development the thumb movement is added.\n5.  Using these exercises, the fingers move in all of the ways they move to\nplay the oboe: all together, one at a time, and in combinations.\n6.  When learning to use the little fingers, number the keys.  The teacher calls\nout the number, and the student moves the little finger in either hand in a\ncircular motion to the numbered key.  Call the numbers in order: call the\nnumbers backward: call the numbers diagonally: call the numbers in any\norder you wish.\nOBOE EMBOUCHURE\n•  Students must be able to use air correctly before beginning to learn the oboe\nembouchure.  The balance of air to the resistance of the reed and instrument is\nvery important for the oboe (possibly more than any other woodwind\ninstrument).\n•  The oboe embouchure is supported by the lips: not the teeth.\n•  The lips must be dry.\n•  The reed is soaked, but before playing, blow the excess water through the staple.\n•  Place the reed one half onto the fleshy part of the lower lip.\n•  Close the lower lip\n•  Keep the teeth open and away from the lips in the “oo” position.\n•  The lips should “pucker” around the reed with the corners forward.\n•  Push the reed slightly toward the lips.\n•  The tips of the blades must be past the lips, and into the chamber of the mouth.\nBoth blades of the reed must be allowed to vibrate freely.  Only the tip should be\ninside of the mouth—approximately ¼ inch.\n•  The reed will sound or “crow” a “C” when used without the instrument.\n•  Keep the body and face calm and still while learning the embouchure.\n•  Watch the student’s face.  A natural look within the adjustments for the\nembouchure is desired.  All aspects of other reed instrument embouchure/face\nrelationships hold true for the oboe.\n•  The embouchure is a work in progress.  The adjustment of the amount of reed\ninto the chamber will be determined by the resonance of the sound.\n•  When playing the oboe, air has a tendency to “back up” in the student’s body.\nThe student should exhale on rests and inhale with new air.\nOBOE ARTICULATION\n•  Do not attempt to teach articulation until all students are producing characteristic\nand consistent sounds on the instrument.\n•  Teach articulation using the oboe.\n•  The tongue is down 98% and up 2% of the time.\n•  Have students say “luh luh,” without moving their corners.  Students should then\nidentify what part of the tongue actually moves.  The back of the tongue should\nstay  in  position  (for  voicing).    Use  this  method  to  touch  the  reed…..the  lower\nblade…..and tip area.\n•  When students articulate, start and continue doing it in 2’s—“luh luh” …….”duh\nduh”  …..not  moving  their  corners.    Vocalize  and  then  perform  on  the  oboe.\nRepeat this process.\n•  One  taste  bud  of  the  student’s  tongue  should  touch  the  bottom  blade  where  it\nmeets the tip.\n•  Remember the student must always touch and interrupt a vibrating reed.\n•  The articulation does not stop the reed vibration.\n•  All that moves when the student articulates is the air and part of the tongue.\n•  The tongue must touch in the same spot with the same energy every time.\n•  Start the vibration, and articulate as fast as the student is able in 2’s.\n•  Start the vibration, and then articulate with the snapped finger on command.\n•  When  pulse  and  foot  pat  are  learned,  articulate  every  time  the  foot  touches  the\nfloor.\n•  Then articulate when the foot touches the floor and as it comes up.\n•  Once  the  student  is  able  to  read  music,  call  the  articulation  “rhythmic\narticulation.”\n•  Every  day  articulate  as  fast  as  the  student  can,  use  the  “luh  luh”….”duh  duh”\nmethod, articulate on command, articulate with foot pat and articulate rhythms.\n•  When the tongue is moving correctly, begin to coordinate finger movement with\nthe articulation.\nOBOE SET 1\nAll exercises are performed on one airstream\nMake sure all sounds have the same resonance\nMove from the center of the note to center of the note\nBe sure all fingers move easily and naturally and that the pads of the fingers stay on the keys.\nœ\nÓ\nŒ\n1\n4 œ\n& 4\n2\n3\n& 44 œ\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\nOBOE – EVEN EXERCISE\nThe “Even Exercise” is to instill even technique during the early stages of learning the\ninstrument.\n•  Students must think “squeeze, release” throughout the exercise.\n•  This should be taught without using music at first and without a written rhythm.\nInstead, use the phrase “I must do this exercise” to express the rhythm.\n•  As presented on this page, use note names before using notes in the staff.

    "text": "BEGINNING SAXOPHONE CLASSROOM AND ENSEMBLE SET-UP\nBeginning Classroom Set-Up\nYour beginning saxophone class should be taught in a smaller room (i.e. ensemble room or secondary band hall).\nConfigure your classroom based on how many students you have in the class.\nStart off the semester by putting students in alphabetical order so you can learn their names faster.  Once music stands and mirrors are utilized in class, hanging name tags can continue to help you learn student names quicker. These can and should also be used on any days you have clinicians/consultants visit.\nTypes of Band Hall Set-Ups\nArched set-up\nIf using your “ensemble set-up” for your class, have students sit in a “box,” so all students receive the same amount of attention/eye contact from you.\nHave students sit in every other chair (if all chairs have to remain in your set-up throughout the day).\nThe aisles between your rows must be large enough so that you will have quick and easy access to any student--both from the front and the back.\nAs much as possible, have students in “windows.”\nYou must be able to see each student from the front and the back.  With that said, you are not always able to correct student’s posture, hand position, etc. from the front of the room; thus, you need to be walking around the room instead of “parking” on a stool!\nOnce you start determining playing ability levels of your students, place weaker players in the front of the classroom and stronger players in the back. Less attention is typically given to players who are further back in the set-up.\nHorseshoe set-up\nThis set-up is not recommended because you have a limited range of vision.\nIf you decide to use this set-up, you will need to pull the stand/podium far enough back in order to have clear vision of every student.\nArched with aisle\nThis is a very acceptable set-up, even with full ensembles.\nStraight line set-up\nThis type of set-up should only be used with bigger facilities.\nIn order for you to have visual contact with all of the students, the students on the ends of the rows will have to adjust their chairs/ bodies towards you or you need to have them sitting in a “box” (see arched set-up).\nStraight line set-up with aisle\nCircular set up\nOne teacher teaches from the inside and one from the periphery. Students face in towards middle.\nIf you are teaching alone, it will be too hard to maneuver when teaching outside of the circle.\nThis set-up is typical in elementary school cafeterias or small stage “cafetoriums.”\nEnsemble Room Set-Up\nBeginner Classroom set-up\nRemember: 90% of tone holes are on the right side of the instrument\nFull Ensemble Set-Up\nSaxophone players need to be in the middle of the ensemble. The first chair alto saxophone player should be near the 1st French horn player so they can more easily balance and match in terms of balance, pitch, etc.\nThere should be a pod of low woodwinds—who should be sitting relatively close to each other--since these instruments tend to have similar parts in their music.\nLow saxophone players should never be placed with the low brass in the back of the ensemble…regardless of whether or not risers are utilized.\nSaxophone Quartet\nUniversity of Houston Set-up\nBS\t\tTS\t\t\t\t\t\t      AS                     BS\nAS\t\t       \t      SS\t\t\t     OR\t\t               SS                              TS\nThe set-up should always form an arc with all players. This makes communication easier since standing on the outside would place them in the blind spot of the other two musicians.\nThe two inner voices (alto and tenor) should not stand next to each other. This helps with balance and prevents these two voices from getting lost in complex passages or in situations where they function as a solo voice.\nAll players should be angling their bodies and instruments in towards the audience.\nThe set-up is subject to change depending on the strengths and weaknesses of each player as well as the repertoire being performed."

    "text": "SOAKING, BREAKING IN AND ADJUSTING REEDS\nSoaking Reeds\nSoak/break in the very first reed…. for several minutes…. together in class while the teacher is closely monitoring the students.  Following this process, the teacher should assign three additional reeds to be broken in for homework.  With that said, reed guards should be going home with students each and every day—whether or not the entire instrument is going home.\nRemove the reed from the plastic reed holder.  The left hand should hold the plastic reed holder, with the thumb on the reed guard logo.  The right hand thumb and index finger should carefully slide the reed out of the plastic reed holder, with the tip coming out first.\nHold the reed with the thumb on the words and the index finger on the back.\nLay the reed on the tongue.  Talk to students about the unusual taste of the reed, and assure them that with time, this process will become second nature.\nDraw the tongue in.  The teeth should not have any contact with the reed.\nPlace the reed in the mouth to moisten and smooth the top and bottom of it.  Moistening the bottom of a reed helps create a seal around the mouthpiece, which will result in better response.\nFlatten the tip of the reed by putting the side with words on the table (flat part of the mouthpiece).  Place the thumb on the on the tip of the reed, (which is now on the table) and wiggle the reed back and forth to get any warps out.  This helps with over-all reed vibration.\nVacuum reeds at the end of class (have students suck air through the mouthpiece to eliminate water on the reed).\nAt the end of each class period/practice session, suck the air through the mouthpiece to eliminate water on the reed.  Reeds can now be “vacuumed” by carefully removing the reed through the lips.  Reeds can furthermore be blotted on shorts/jeans/etc.  This will eliminate excessive saliva to remain on the reed…which will eventually mold if not vacuumed.\nWith the plastic reed holder held in the same manner as discussed in #1, carefully slide the butt of the reed into the reed guard first, so that the tip is not destroyed.\nBreaking in Reeds\nThere are two specific reasons why breaking in reeds is important:\nso reeds last longer\nso students will always have reeds on hand\nThere is a process involved to properly and effectively break in a reed:\nBreak in two to four reeds at a time.  Most reed guards have four slots.  Break in two reeds at a time to avoid all four reeds dying at the same time.\nStudents should soak reeds as described in #5 in the previous section.  Reeds should not be soaked for too long; otherwise, they will become waterlogged.\nStudents should play on each new reed for no longer than five minutes.  If the tip becomes transparent, then the student should switch reeds.  The reed should not become waterlogged, and it should not be used when playing in extreme registers.\nAfter following this procedure for three days, students can start playing on the reeds for a longer period of time.  As this takes place, students and teachers can start to judge the sound quality of the reed and make any necessary adjustments.\nTricks for Adjusting Poor Quality Reeds\nEvery reed is different and will sound different.\nStudents should learn to be picky about the sound quality of reeds.\nWhen dealing with a reed that is too soft:\nMove the reed up on the mouthpiece slightly.  This is only a temporary “quick fix” if there are no other reeds available.  The ligature can also be raised slightly on the reed/mouthpiece.  Do not raise the ligature above the bark (polished bottom part) of the reed.\nClip the reed using a reed clipper.  This cuts off part of the tip of the reed.  Only an experienced lesson teacher or a very knowledgeable band director should be clipping reeds.\nSet the reed aside and let it sit/age.  Time and weather will change the quality of a reed.\nColder climates make certain reeds sound thinner.  Students may need to wait for warmer weather before coming back to that particular reed.\nWhen dealing with a reed that is too hard:\nFor mildly hard reeds, “polish” the reed on a sheet of paper. Place the flat part of a reed (not the side with bark) on the paper and press/rub in circles with 2 or 3 fingers. This must be done on a flat surface.\nFor mildly hard reeds, the reed can be lowered slightly on the mouthpiece so that the thinner part of the reed is being played. Be aware, however, that this is only a quick fix. The ligature can also be moved slightly lower on the reed/mouthpiece, if necessary.\nFor slightly harder reeds, sand down the flat part of the reed with 600 grit sand paper (or finer). The reed must then be polished.\nFor very hard reeds:\nDetermine which side of the reed is harder.\nPlay on the left and right side to see which side is more difficult to produce a sound on.\nUse a reed knife and scrape off wood from both sides surrounding the heart. Do not scrape off the tip or the heart of the reed. Remove more cane from the thicker side.  Be very careful not to scrape off too much.\nAgain, only an experienced lesson teacher or a very knowledgeable band director should be scraping reeds.\nTry pushing on the tip of the reed with the thumb while it is on the mouthpiece. Close the tip opening and then press a little more 2-3 times. Check to see if the reed is softer.\nAsk an older/more experienced private lesson teachers for even more tricks that may be out there!\nSometimes a student is simply dealing with a bad reed………and throwing it away is easier than the frustration it will cause………let alone the many attempts to fix/adjust the reed."

    ],
    "text": "SAXOPHONE ASSEMBLY AND\nINSTRUMENT/BODY RATIO\n•  As you begin to teach the saxophone, give only the “set-up” (mouthpiece, neck and\nligature), as well as all related maintenance kit items (reeds, reed guard, mouthpiece\ncap, swab and cork grease), to the students in a plastic bag with the student’s name on\nit.  The body will remain in the case until further instruction is given.\n•  Students should be told that after sound production has been taught on the “set-up,”\nthey will be allowed to take home the body of the saxophone as well. To sell this\nconcept to the parents, explain the money factor.  It is almost as expensive to replace\none broken item as it is to buy an entire instrument.\nAssembly of the mouthpiece and neck “set-up”\n1.  Open the case, which should be on the floor in front of the student.\n2.  Put the reed in the mouth to moisten and smooth the top and bottom of it.\nMoistening the bottom of a reed helps create a seal, which will result in better\nresponse.\n3.  Take out the neck, avoiding the octave key. Do not put pressure on the octave\nkey; instead, grasp on the top or bottom of the neck.\n4.  Hold the octave key down on the neck with the palm of the hand.\n5.  Place the mouthpiece without the ligature on the neck using slight, twisting\nmotions.  Leave 1/4 to 1/3 of the cork showing on the neck for beginners.\nApplication of cork grease may b necessary at this time. When placed\ncorrectly, it is possible for the teacher to make a mark on the cork with a felt\ntip pen.  Never grab the tip of the mouthpiece; always grasp around the\nmiddle.\n6.  Place the large end of the ligature over the mouthpiece carefully.  Make sure\nthe screws are on the right--in the back--as you look at them from the table of\nthe mouthpiece.  Bonade ligatures have two screws……BG ligatures have one\nscrew.  If using Rovner ligatures, the leather is in the front and there is one\nscrew in the back.\n7.  Lift the ligature slightly with the thumb and forefinger of a chosen hand, and\ncarefully slide the reed onto the table of the mouthpiece.  The reed is placed\nfat to fat, flat to flat and thin to thin.\n8.  Line the sides of the reed up with the rails.\n9.  Look for a thin black line/sliver at the tip of the mouthpiece.\n10. The ligature should be slightly below the line on the bottom of most quality\nmouthpieces.  Pertaining to C* mouthpieces, the ligature should line up with\nthe top line closest to the tip of the mouthpiece…….and the top line of the\nmouthpiece lines up with the line on the middle of the reed.\n11. For ligatures with two screws:  tighten the lower screw snuggly, and the top\nscrew to its first point of resistance.  For ligatures with one screw:  tighten the\nscrew to its first point of resistance.  Generally speaking, ligatures that are\nplaced too low result in control issues; ligatures that are placed too high\nprohibit reed vibration.\nAssembly of the body of the saxophone (assuming that the assembly of the\nmouthpiece and neck set-up is already completed and is kept in a safe place)\n1.  Take out the neck strap and put it on.  Students with hoodies need to make\nsure the neck strap is placed on the skin of their neck.  For neck straps\nwith visible logos (i.e. Protec), the logo should be facing up.\n2.  Take the body out and clip it onto the neck strap.  Never trust that the neck\nstrap will secure the saxophone, because the hooks can easily snap.  Grab\nthe body with the right hand and support the back of the saxophone with\nthe left hand.  Discourage students from grabbing the bell as opposed to\nthe body, because the bell could become unaligned with time.  DO NOT\nLET THE SAXOPHONE HANG FROM THE NECK STRAP.\n3.  Remove the plug from the saxophone.  The plug protects the octave key\nmechanism, which pushes the neck to open the tone holes.  This\nmechanism is very expensive to replace.  All saxophones must have a\nplug.  Check to make sure all students have a plug; students playing used\nor attic horns may not have one.\n4.  Loosen the neck screw, which will be on the right on all beginner\ninstruments. Students should turn the screw towards them.\n5.  Twist and push the neck and mouthpiece set-up (already assembled) onto\nthe body of the saxophone, avoiding the palm keys.  Line up the brace--on\nthe bottom of the neck--to the top of the octave key rod. More simply put,\nthe point that sticks out should be exactly in line with the brace on the\nbottom of the neck.\n6.  Turn the screw that supports the neck to the first point of resistance.  Too\nmuch pressure during this process may result in a stripped screw.\n• When the alto and tenor saxophones have to be set down on the chair or floor for any\nreason (leaving class, breathing exercises where students are standing, etc.), students\nshould first turn the neck slightly to their left. It is furthermore important that the rods\nare facing down with the low C key guard on the edge of the chair.  This is to prevent\nthe D palm key from being damaged.  However, regarding the baritone saxophone:\nthis instrument can be put down with the rods up; because the instrument rests on the\ncrook, the keys are higher and will therefore result in little if any chance of damage.\n• When students have to leave their chair during a class, the mouthpiece and neck needs\nto be removed and placed on the chair; the body of the instrument can then be placed\nunderneath the chair in the above-stated manner.\nInstrument Disassembly\n1.  Open the case, which should again be placed on the floor in front of the\nstudent.\n2.  Loosen the neck screw and put the neck and mouthpiece in a safe place.\nBe sure the octave key is depressed with the palm of the hand as the neck\nis removed.\n3.  Swab the body of the instrument.  Do not yank or pull the swab from\nside-to-side.  Using light tugs, pull the swab straight down from the top\nand out through the bell.  Leave the neck strap on to prevent the\ninstrument from being dropped. While doing this, one hand should\nalways be holding the body of the instrument.\n4.  Replace the plug in the body and tighten the screw.\n5.  Replace the body in the case.  Grab the body with the right hand and\nsupport the back of the saxophone with the left hand.\n6.  Pick up the neck and mouthpiece.  Loosen the ligature screw(s). Do not\nlet the students loosen the screw(s) so much that the screws fall out!\n7.  Remove the reed by lifting the ligature with the thumb and forefinger,\nbeing careful not to have any contact with the tip of the reed.  “Vacuum”\nthe reed through the lips……blot the reed on the pants/shorts if\nnecessary……and put in the reed guard.\n8.  Remove the ligature from the mouthpiece.\n9.  Remove the mouthpiece from the neck by using slight, twisting motions.\n10. Swab the neck once the mouthpiece has been removed.  The swab can be\npulled through the neck, but be aware that the neck has a little protrusion\n(octave flu) on which the swab can tear.\n11. Replace the neck in the case.\n12. The ligature must be left on the mouthpiece with a dry reed and a plastic\nprotector. Consider using an old or unused DRY reed to be placed on the\nmouthpiece at the end of each playing session, whether it is at school or\nat home.  Always leave the ligature on the mouthpiece with this “dry\nreed,” which is replacing the “class reed.”  This will prevent damage and\nallow the ligature to form and bond more correctly with the mouthpiece.\nA “USED/WET” REED WILL RESULT IN MOLD OR MILDEW\nFORMING ON THE REED, IN THE MOUTHPIECE AND THE\nCASE.\n13. Replace the mouthpiece in the case.\n14. Students should be given CLASS TIME to clean out their instrument,\nand store their reed and instrument properly in the case.\n15. SEND SEGMENTS OF THIS INFORMATION HOME TO\nPARENTS.  CHOOSE THE INFORMATION YOU THINK\nWOULD BE HELPFUL FOR HOME PRACTICE AND\nINSTRUMENT CARE.\nInstrument/Body Ratio\n•  All neck strap adjustments require the use of both hands (when body of saxophone is\nnot yet being used). When students have learned how to hold the saxophone, it can be\nlaid on their lap or in the case while they continue learning how to adjust their neck\nstrap.\n• Familiarize the student with the instrument/body ratio by using the fully assembled\nsaxophone but without the reed.  Be sure the saxophone is adjusted to the student by\nadjusting instrument placement and neck strap length.\n• In the beginning, the “baby position” for saxophone can be achieved by students\ngrasping the bell with their right hand and grasping gently around the top of the body.\n• There are three balance points when holding the saxophone:\n1.  both thumbs\n2.  side of the leg\n3.  neck strap\n• Make sure that the body is in its natural playing posture when finding these balance\npositions.  The student should feel comfortable at all times.  The right arm should\nfollow the line of the upper body.  It should never be placed back behind the chest\ncavity.  When these balance points are focused on at one time, the posture will look\nvery natural.\n• When the right arm incorrectly falls behind the chest cavity, students can:\n1.  loosen their neck strap\n2.  turn the neck\n3.  torque the mouthpiece\n• Correct playing position will be realized when all of the aforementioned details from\nthis handout are understood.  The weight of the saxophone is difficult to balance\nwithout the fulcrum created by the combination of the three balance points.\n• Watch for students to rest the bottom of the bell on either their knee or on the chair\nitself while playing (cid:1)."

    "text": "MAKING THE FIRST SAXOPHONE MOUTHPIECE\nAND NECK SOUND\n•\nInitial sound production cannot be introduced until correct posture and breathing\nhas been successfully taught.  Include these two essential components as “part” of\nthe first sound attempt(s).\n•  Relax position and ready position should already be taught and drilled prior to\nsound production.  As sound production is occurring, playing position must be\nincorporated.  Students need to understand that ready position means they are\nready to play.  Playing position means that they are set (physically) to play.\nStudents should not be allowed to sit in relax position during class, except maybe\nduring announcements, paperwork or things not pertaining to playing.  If one\nword instructions are preferred, then use “ready” and “set.”\n•  Try to get every student to make a sound on the first day of sound production.  If\nyou will not be able to accomplish this, make a disclaimer before you start.  The\nstudents who do not end up getting to make their first sound—on the first day—\nwill be the first students you will start with on the second day!  Students should\nnot be surprised or frustrated if you do not get to them on this first day.\n•  On day one of sound production, make another disclaimer if you suspect that you\nwill not get far enough along to allow any of the students to take home their “set-\nup”.\n•  At the end of each class, you must make the decision to allow just those who you\nassisted to take home their set-up…….or not allow set-ups to go home until\neveryone has made sounds with your assistance (day one, day two, etc.).\n•  Once you allow and require set-ups to go home on a daily basis, students should\nbe recording their practice time on whatever form of practice card you are using.\nBe realistic when designating ____ minutes to be spent on their set-up sounds\nduring their home practice.\nIt is not necessary to have students make sounds on just the mouthpiece (without\nthe neck).  It will be much easier for you……and eventually less awkward for the\nstudents…….to hold the mouthpiece and neck.  If you choose to start on just the\nmouthpiece, then you are encouraged to add the neck very soon.\n•  Do not use a metronome when assisting students to make their first sounds.  A\nmetronome should not be added until the class is at the point of making group\nsounds.\n•  Remind students that lipstick, Chapstick, etc. cannot be worn during class.\nStudents need to understand that their reeds will not last long, and they will begin\nto see mold.  (cid:1)\n•  When working one-on-one with students in your beginning class, it is important\nthat the students are ready as soon as the teacher reaches them.  While other\nstudents are waiting, they must either be paying attention to what you are\ndoing…..or working on a music theory worksheet, etc.\n•  While going around the room, students should not be allowed to make sounds on\ntheir set-up—even if they have already been assisted.  They should also not be\nallowed to improperly hold their set-up (i.e. putting a finger in the bottom of their\nneck…..twirling or playing with the set-up in general……etc.)\n•  The instructor must place all mouthpiece and neck for students.  This may\ncontinue for 2-5 days (if not longer), depending on the size and overall ability\nlevel of your class.\n•  You should be directly in front of each individual student when assisting them,\nand not to the side. It would be most effective if students were standing and\n“finding their horizon.”  Music stands should be elevated to the proper height,\nand a mirror should be properly positioned on each stand.  You will learn to\nmaneuver around each student’s equipment, etc.  At this point, all cases should be\ndirectly under or to the side of their chairs.\n•  As you are working with each student, your goal is to assist each student in\nmaking a quality sound on or in the vicinity of the correct pitch (second space A-\nflat).  Do not get on to students who do not produce the exact pitch—especially if\nthey are using brands of mouthpieces and ligatures that may be inferior and/or not\non your recommended list.  When listening to each student, listen for:\no  quality of sound\no  consistency of sound\no  pitch\n•  Unless the saxophone is your primary instrument, you should not be modeling\nsounds on the set-up.  As you assist each student, you will eventually find a “star\nstudent” who will become the model for future reference.  Be sure to periodically\nuse a keyboard or a metronome—with pitches—so as not to “lose sight” of the\ncorrect pitch (regardless of whether or not a model is used).\n•  Be aware of fragile and/or teary-eyed students. Move on to the next student in the\ninterest of time, but make an effort to return to these students by the end of class.\nDo not let a student leave class feeling unsuccessful.  If possible, offer a pass for\nstruggling students to come in at lunch or before/after school.\n•  The set-up always goes to the student; not the student to the set-up.\n•  Before bringing the set-up to the student, check for:\nligatures that have been placed correctly\nligature screws that are too tight\no\no  proper mouthpiece angles\no  proper alignment of the reed\no  condition of reeds\n•  Train students not to move their faces or body when you are placing the set-up. It\nmay take certain students multiple tries, and if they move after each attempt, they\n(and you!) basically have to start over each time.\n•  When students breathe, do not allow their corners to pull back at all.\nFurthermore, upper lips should not be coming off the plastic of the tops of the\nmouthpieces.  Students should breathe only through their corners, keeping their\nupper lips on the tops of the mouthpieces.\n•  With the set-up, students should progress through the following steps:\no  air (The sound starts and ends with air, making students aware of how\nthey can control their air.  This also helps students avoid undue tightness\nin the embouchure.)\no  air~vibration~air (The air “turns into” a vibration and returns to air.)\no  air~vibration\no  vibration (ultimate “final” sound)\n•  No articulation syllable should be used when making set-up sounds.  The ultimate\ngoal is for students to start their sounds with air.  An articulation syllable will be\nassigned after all students are making characteristic and consistent sounds on the\nset-up, as well as the fully-assembled saxophone.\n•  Students need to direct their air through an imaginary dot, which is at the center of\ntheir mouthpiece and reed, in order to achieve the desired sound.\n•  Make sure the students understand that “a sound” may not happen the very first\ntime. This is a trial and error process and may take multiple tries.\n•  Once the set-up has been placed correctly and students are making the sound you\nwant, they need to remember:\no  how it looks (by looking in the mirror)\no  how it feels\nAllow and instruct them to take the set-up from your hand without moving their\nbody and embouchure.  Have them try to reproduce the sound on their own.  Be\nprepared to further assist them if necessary.  When the sound is correct, students\nneed to remember how it sounds.\n•  Train students to freeze their body, face and embouchure at the end of whatever\ntype of sound is being made (whether it is air, a tone, etc.)  The student should not\nmove anything until the director calls the students to ready position.  This aspect\nof playing should transfer to any—and everything students play in the future (i.e.\nafter last notes of lines out of the book, last notes of songs, etc.)\n•  Whether students are making individual or group sounds, they need to stop when\nthey feel like they are running out of air.  It should never be thought of as a\ncontest to see who can hold their sounds the longest.  That serves absolutely no\nbenefit.\nIf a student feels dizzy or faint, allow them to bend over in their chair for a little\nwhile until they feel better.\nIf you feel or hear air escaping from the student’s embouchure, the student is most\nlikely not sealing properly.  This is usually caused by students pulling their\ncorners back.  Students need to constantly be told to bring their corners forward.\nAfter a student has been made aware that they are leaking air, the expectation\nshould be stated for the student to return to class the next day without that issue.\n•  While students are playing, it may be necessary to gently wiggle their mouthpiece\nfrom side to side, during which you will hear pitch variation.  This is simply\nmaking the student aware that their corners are not firm and/or their top teeth are\nnot on the top of the mouthpiece.  Ultimately, you should not be able to move the\nmouthpiece at all.\n•  The teacher should always forewarn a student before removing the mouthpiece\nfrom the student’s mouth.  The mouthpiece can easily scrape the teeth or create\ndiscomfort.\nIf you are too easily able to slide the mouthpiece out of a student’s mouth, their\ntop teeth are most likely not on the top of the mouthpiece like they should be.\nThis also means that students are holding the mouthpiece with their lips instead of\ntheir teeth.\n•  Extraneous noises at ends of sounds are a result of students collapsing their\nembouchures and/or postures.  Have students sing “la” or “dah”; then, apply that\nto the end of their sound.\nIt is your job, as the teacher, to diagnose any problems through this trial and error\nprocess.  As you go around the room, it may be helpful to you to take written\nnotes on students having problems.  Jot down any catchphrases, analogies or\nspecific things that you said to them that helped them in any way!\nIf you are struggling in your efforts to assist multiple students…..or are unsure\nabout what you are doing in general, then hire an outside consultant or\nexperienced private lesson teacher to come to your class and help.  As this\nprofessional goes around the room to hear your students, you need to follow\nthem……watch exactly what they are doing…..and take notes as well.  No\nmatter the scenario, reference these notes as you see fit in future classes.\nIf you have a large class, it may be necessary for “waiting” students to re-soak\ntheir reeds after ________ students have played.\n•  After _____ days, students will eventually need to be able to place their set-up\nand make a sound without your assistance.  The amount of time will vary year to\nyear, taking into consideration the size of the class, the overall quality of their\nsounds, and how many times you have assisted the students.\n•  Students need to constantly be reminded that characteristic and consistent\nset-up sounds are stepping stones to making sounds on the fully-assembled\nsaxophone!  Students who do not practice their set-up sounds at home are\nnot only slowing the class down, but are not contributing to the daily\nprogress and quality of the class.\n**Much of this information is applicable to beginner interviews."

    "text": "SAXOPHONE EXTENDED FINGER\nTECHNIQUES\nExtended finger techniques refer to the use of the pinky keys of the left and\nright hand as well as the palm keys. Developing efficient technique in these\nareas is vital to the student’s ability to play technically.\nPalm Keys (all played with the octave key)\n•  High D – “PK 1” (PK closest to the octave key)\no  Use the LH index finger; where the 1st (big) knuckle meets the\npalm.\no  Keep the other fingers curved and hovering over the pearls.\n•  High D # – “PK 1 and 2”\no  Use the LH index finger, 2nd (middle) knuckle\n*PK 2 is the highest key on the instrument (vertically) and\ncentered between the other two PKs (horizontally)\no  Keep the other fingers curved, relaxed, and hovering.\no  This is where tension begins to creep into the palm – keep it\nrelaxed.\n•  High E – “PK 1 and 2”  plus RH top side key\no  Left hand remains the same – keep it relaxed.\no  Add the top side key in the RH – use the space between the big\nand middle knuckle.\n(cid:1)  It is VERY IMPORTANT that the student’s right hand\nposition stay as close to normal as possible. Ensure the\nright hand fingers stay as close to hovering over the\npearls as possible. Students tend to contort and move the\nentire hand to activate this key, which is inefficient.\n•  High F – “PK 1, 2 and 3” plus RH top side key\no  Left hand adds the third palm key using the 2nd (middle\nknuckle) of the LH middle finger…not the index finger!\no  Keep the palm soft and relaxed.\no  Hand should remain curved.\no  Like high E, the RH hand position should stay as close to\nnormal as possible.\n*Remember, the higher the tone hole is, the higher the pitch is.\nBeginning students have smaller hands, so you will have to be forgiving if\ntheir hands are not quite big enough to execute the technique exactly as\nlisted. Some exceptions will have to be made. Have students practice palm\nkey exercises (provided) every other day for short intervals as their hands\nwill get tired.\nPinky Keys\nIt is most important that the pinkies to do not “lock up” when engaging these\nkeys in the left or right hand.\nRight Hand\n•  When moving from the D#/Eb (upstairs) key to the C (downstairs)\nkey, it is important to land on the roller, never past it.  Slide roller to\nroller, NOT key to key.\n•  Practice exercises moving from D#/Eb to C not playing and playing.\nPractice these in short intervals as the pinkies will get tired.  Teach\nyour students to work on these two or three times during their practice\nsession for short amounts of time every other day.\nLeft Hand\n•  When using the LH pinky, it is important that students NEVER pick\nthe pinky up when moving between keys!\n•  When using the C#/Db and the B key, slide roller to roller, NOT key\nto key.\n•  When using the A#/Bb key, students can either move roller to roller,\nor pivot the LH pinky down.  The pinky leans down and never leaves\nthe bottom of the B (inside) key, which means students must bring\ntheir hand lower.  The faster students play, the more they must pivot\nfrom their wrist.\no  The low A#/Bb keys on most Selmer saxophones can be raised\nby a skilled repairman, so there is less of a downwards motion.\n•  The B key is lower on all saxophones; however, a skilled repairman\ncan bend the key higher.\no  The B and C#/Db keys on beginner Yamaha saxophones should\nalready be flush.\n•  Practice exercises moving from C#/Db to B, and B to A#/Bb (harder).\nThe same practice rules apply.\nG #/ Ab (1)\nC# / Db (2)\n“outside”\nB (3) “inside”\nA# / Bb (4)\nYou can purchase PK and side key risers, which are black/rubber, at\nwww.wwbw.com.  They are very inexpensive (around $5 per set), are non-\nspecific, and can be used on any key.  These assist players with larger\nfingers, and decrease the distance the fingers have to travel to put the keys\ndown.  They tend to get loose over time, so buy a set as often as necessary."

    "text": "ALTO SAXOPHONE CASES,\nIDENTIFICATION OF PARTS AND\nREMOVING IT FROM ITS CASE\nGeneral Information About All Woodwind Instrument Cases\n•  Most cases have distinguishing marks somewhere on the case.\nIdentify these marks, and their relationship to the top and bottom of\nthe case. Most cases have the handles placed on the bottom section\nof each case. Check to make sure.\n•  Place all saxophone cases on the floor in front of the student.\n•  Be sure the student understands where each part of the instrument belongs in\nthe case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make\nsure the student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure\nthe parts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse order they\nwere removed.\n•  All instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure\nexplicitly every time.\n•  Never leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up,\nbut this is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.\nCheck each opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to\nyour students.\n•  Cases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom\nsetup for each student’s case.  If using an ensemble room for the class, the\ncases may be opened in the hall.  The empty case will remain closed and\nlatched in the hall during class.\n•  When instruments are in their cases, do not allow students to sit on their cases\nAT ANY TIME because the low E-flat and C key guards will get bent.\nIdentifying Parts of the Saxophone and Removing It Safely From Its Case\n•  Once the case information is understood, place the case on the floor.  Never let\nthe student place the case in his lap.\nIdentify the neck strap.\n•  Open the case from its correct position.  Remember, most latches will lift up.\n•\n•  When new instruments are delivered during the summer, be sure to remove the\nparts carefully from the plastic wrapping, and remove the corks (which are used\nto help pads keep their shape during shipping) between the rods.\n•  Corks on the neck of a new beginner instrument are usually really fat mainly\ndue to heat exposure during the delivery process.  The mouthpiece will not\neasily fit on the neck.  Only someone with experience should carefully sand the\ncork to the proper size.  Using very fine sand paper (400), take off a very small\namount and wrap it around and turn from side to side, being careful not to\nscrape too much as it could damage the laquer.  After this process, test it many\ntimes until you have the correct fit that can easily be controlled by a young\nstudent.\n•  For both new and used beginner instruments, it may be necessary to apply cork\ngrease lightly to the corks after instruments are delivered during the summer.\nMaking a ring with your thumb and forefinger, work the cork grease into each\ncork to create enough friction to properly lubricate the corks. Students will\neventually need to be taught to apply cork grease as well. Even if the student\nunderstands how little is needed, you still must watch them apply the cork\ngrease several times before you trust them to do the job alone.  Never let the\nstudent have his own tube of cork grease in the beginning of the learning\nprocess.  After he has proven his competence, he may have the tube.  If the\ncork looks dull, and the mouthpiece is difficult to fit with the neck, a small\namount of cork grease may be needed. Teach him to ask you first before\napplying. Once you know he has made the correct analysis, the student may\nmake his own decisions. Cork grease tubes or liquid grease can explode or melt\ninside the case if the respective lids are not completely closed. It is possible that\ndamage to the key mechanism will result if cork grease comes in contact with\nthe wood, metal or even other maintenance kit items.\n•  The body of the saxophone is one “unit” in the case and is easily placed into\nand taken from the case.\n•  The mouthpiece has a thin end and a fat end.  The top is curved, and the bottom\n(table) is flat.  The importance of these features will be explained later.\n•  The ligature is usually metal for the beginning instrument, having both a large\nend and a small end. The screws for the ligature will always appear on the right\nside of the mouthpiece as the student looks at the mouthpiece from the flat side.\nScrews for ligatures will never appear on the left side of the mouthpiece.\n•  The reed is basically the same shape as the mouthpiece.  It has a thin end and a\nfat end…..a flat side and a curved side.\n•  The reed/mouthpiece cap (protector) should be made of plastic (and sometimes\nmetal with attic horns) for the beginning instrument.  If metal protectors are\nused, be aware that they will most likely scratch the mouthpiece and perhaps\ndamage the tip of the reed.  Using a plastic protector will result in fewer broken\nreeds.  Students should always keep their mouthpiece in a mouthpiece cap\nwhen the instrument is not being played (including moving from a warm-up\nroom to a concert stage). A single chip in a mouthpiece can render it useless,\ncausing students to have to purchase a new one.\n•  Periodically have mouthpiece checks.  Check for chips on rails and on the tip.\nAlso check for chips on the inside of the tip.  Give written work to your\nstudents while you check each mouthpiece carefully.  A chipped mouthpiece\ncan be devastating to a beginning saxophone student’s embouchure\ndevelopment.\n•  No music, folders, flipfolders, rolled up music or unnecessary objects may be\nplaced in the case (especially on top of the instrument) at any time…..unless\nthey can fit inside the compartment meant for these items.\n•  Students should not be allowed to keep anything in the bell (i.e. rolled up\nmusic, neck straps, drill folders, reed boxes, water bottles, mouthpieces, etc.).\nPertaining specifically to baritone saxophone, some of these items could\nactually get stuck in the bell/instrument.\n•  Look at the case in relation to the parts of the saxophone.

    "text": "SAXOPHONE EXERCISES FOR GROUP SOUNDS\nGroup exercises—whether on the neck and mouthpiece (“short instrument” or “baby\ninstrument”) or the fully-assembled saxophone—should be performed with the assumption\nthat you have gone around the room as much as necessary before allowing students to\nmake sounds on their own in this group setting.\nYou must make the decision as to when to allow short instruments to go home with your\nstudents.\nThe use of mirrors is imperative so students are consistent with everything they are doing.\nBreathing should already be introduced by this point.\nThe metronome should already be introduced by this point.\nFor exercises 1-6, articulation has not been taught at this time; therefore, air starts are\nused.  The tongue should remain naturally at the bottom of the mouth.\nRemind students to always be thinking pulse……as well as “start” and “stop” when\nappropriate.\nWhen appropriate for a specific exercise, audiation of note names with actual pitches is\nhighly recommended.\nMOUTHPIECE AND NECK EXERCISES\n1.   Drill “ready position” and “playing/set position” DAILY.\na.  Call students to “ready position”….then to “playing/set position”……..and back\nto “ready position”, etc.  For shorter/faster instructions, simply say “ready” and\n“set/playing”.\nb.  Repeat this over and over and over.\nc.  This teaches students how to set their short instruments.\nd.  Students should look at their mirrors! DO NOT make them look at you.\n2.  Allow students to make sounds on their own.\na.  Students must exhibit good posture.\nb.  Students should be holding their short instrument correctly.\nc.  Students should be taking proper breaths.\nd.  You, the instructor, need to monitor students.  DO NOT bury your head in the\nstand.\nFor all exercises that use the metronome, make sure students lightly tap their right hand\nfingers on top of the neck for keeping track of the beats.  Quarter note = 80 (with\nsubdivisions) is a good tempo to perform all exercises at.\n3.   With a model playing (or you if saxophone is your primary instrument)\na.  All students should be looking at the model, who should be standing directly\ncentered and in front of the class.  The instructor should be walking around the\nclassroom and monitoring students.\nb.  There should never be an overlap of sound between the model and the class;\nalways place a whole rest between the model and the class.\nc.  Teach students the “start…stop” drill (using audiation).\nd.  The model and the entire class should breathe on beat 3 (when in 4/4 time).\ne.  Sound the subdivision on the metronome at ALL TIMES. Start this at the very\nbeginning.  If students are having trouble, help them with their foot tap by putting\nyour foot on top of theirs.\nf.  During rests and while the model is playing, you must talk to students about the\nnecessity about staying completely set.  This will more quickly help students to\nlearn where exactly to place their short instrument.  The students should look so\nstill to the point that they look like they are still playing!\ng.  The only embouchure movement that is allowed is for students that are having\ndifficulty making a sound…..and need to adjust something in order to achieve a\nsound.\n4.  Model, Student A, Model, Student B, Model, Student C, etc.\na.  Always place a whole rest in between the model and the student.\nb.  After every few students play, have the entire class play as a group.\nc.  The model should be walking around the classroom with the instructor, so that all\nstudents can easily see the model’s embouchure, etc..\nd.  Depending on the size of your class, it is your decision to have students stay in\n“playing/set position” the entire time…..or instead allow students to be in\n“playing/set position” after every ___ students.\n5.  Have all students stand and individually play one sound; if they do not get a sound for\nany reason, they have to sit down.  (cid:1)\na.  The metronome is not used for this exercise.\nb.  Tell students that do not get sounds that they need to practice more at home!\nc.  Have some sort of incentive for those students who are still standing at the end of\none or more rotations.\n6.  Entire class—without a model—playing whole note, whole rest, etc… with the\nmetronome.\na.  Perform this type of exercise when you feel the class is ready.\nb.  Before students play, have them audiate using “start……..stop”.\n7.  Entire class playing two articulated and connected whole notes followed by a whole rest,\nrepeat, etc.  At this point, articulation must have already been taught.\na.  Again, students can audiate the “start….stop” drill.\nb.  Students are thinking “dah”.\n8.  Entire class playing two articulated and connected half notes followed by a whole rest,\nrepeat, etc.\n9.  The instructor or model performs random—yet not complicated—rhythms, while the\nentire class imitates.\na.  Perform this exercise both with and without whole rests in between the\nmodel/instructor and the class.\nb.  It would be a good idea to incorporate rhythms—from the beginning band method\nbook used in your class—that not not yet been introduced.\n**EVERY CLASS FOR 1-2 WEEKS MUST BEGIN WITH SOME SORT OF A\nMOUTHPIECE AND NECK EXERCISE!!!!**\nFULLY-ASSEMBLED  SAXOPHONE EXERCISES\n1.  The first note students should play is 3rd space C#/Db.\n•  This note can be played before teaching actual hand position.\nAt this point, hand position should already be taught.\n2.  Slur diatonic notes from third space C down to middle C.\n3.  Typical exercises you will see in most beginner method books\n•  Should be audiated on pitch with actual note names…as well as with “start” and\n“stop”.\n•  Can be performed with or without articulation\n•  Changing notes; can be performed with or without articulation\n•  Progressive adding of more notes; can still be performed with or without\narticulation\n•  When you approach the first line in the book—which contains two or more back-\nto-back notes—these notes must obviously be articulated.  Therefore, you must\nhave already taught articulation with the proper syllable before these lines can be\nattempted.\n•  WHEN YOU TEACH ARTICULATION, YOU MUST FIRST INTRODUCE IT\nON THE MOUTHPIECE AND NECK."

    "text": "SOAKING, BREAKING IN AND ADJUSTING REEDS\nSoaking Reeds\n•  Soak/break in the very first reed…. for several minutes…. together in class while\nthe teacher is closely monitoring the students.  Following this process, the teacher\nshould assign three additional reeds to be broken in for homework.  With that said,\nreed guards should be going home with students each and every day—whether or not\nthe entire instrument is going home.\n1.  Remove the reed from the plastic reed holder.  The left hand should hold the plastic\nreed holder, with the thumb on the reed guard logo.  The right hand thumb and index\nfinger should carefully slide the reed out of the plastic reed holder, with the tip\ncoming out first.\n2.  Hold the reed with the thumb on the words and the index finger on the back.\n3.  Lay the reed on the tongue.  Talk to students about the unusual taste of the reed, and\nassure them that with time, this process will become second nature.\n4.  Draw the tongue in.  The teeth should not have any contact with the reed.\n5.  Place the reed in the mouth to moisten and smooth the top and bottom of it.\nMoistening the bottom of a reed helps create a seal around the mouthpiece, which\nwill result in better response.\n6.  Flatten the tip of the reed by putting the side with words on the table (flat part of the\nmouthpiece).  Place the thumb on the on the tip of the reed, (which is now on the\ntable) and wiggle the reed back and forth to get any warps out.  This helps with over-\nall reed vibration.\n7.  Vacuum reeds at the end of class (have students suck air through the mouthpiece to\neliminate water on the reed).\n8.  At the end of each class period/practice session, suck the air through the mouthpiece\nto eliminate water on the reed.  Reeds can now be “vacuumed” by carefully removing\nthe reed through the lips.  Reeds can furthermore be blotted on shorts/jeans/etc.  This\nwill eliminate excessive saliva to remain on the reed…which will eventually mold if\nnot vacuumed.  (cid:1)\n9.  With the plastic reed holder held in the same manner as discussed in #1, carefully\nslide the butt of the reed into the reed guard first, so that the tip is not destroyed.\nBreaking in Reeds\n•  There are two specific reasons why breaking in reeds is important:\n1.  so reeds last longer\n2.  so students will always have reeds on hand\n•  There is a process involved to properly and effectively break in a reed:\no  Break in two to four reeds at a time.  Most reed guards have four slots.  Break\nin two reeds at a time to avoid all four reeds dying at the same time.\no  Students should soak reeds as described in #5 in the previous section.  Reeds\nshould not be soaked for too long; otherwise, they will become waterlogged.\no  Students should play on each new reed for no longer than five minutes.  If the\ntip becomes transparent, then the student should switch reeds.  The reed\nshould not become waterlogged, and it should not be used when playing in\nextreme registers.\no  After following this procedure for three days, students can start playing on the\nreeds for a longer period of time.  As this takes place, students and teachers\ncan start to judge the sound quality of the reed and make any necessary\nadjustments.\nTricks for Adjusting Poor Quality Reeds\n•  Every reed is different and will sound different.\n•  Students should learn to be picky about the sound quality of reeds.\n•  When dealing with a reed that is too soft:\no  Move the reed up on the mouthpiece slightly.  This is only a temporary “quick\nfix” if there are no other reeds available.  The ligature can also be raised\nslightly on the reed/mouthpiece.  Do not raise the ligature above the bark\n(polished bottom part) of the reed.\no  Clip the reed using a reed clipper.  This cuts off part of the tip of the reed.\nOnly an experienced lesson teacher or a very knowledgeable band director\nshould be clipping reeds.\no  Set the reed aside and let it sit/age.  Time and weather will change the quality\n•\nof a reed.\no  Colder climates make certain reeds sound thinner.  Students may need to wait\nfor warmer weather before coming back to that particular reed.\nWhen dealing with a reed that is too hard:\no  For mildly hard reeds, “polish” the reed on a sheet of paper. Place the flat part\nof a reed (not the side with bark) on the paper and press/rub in circles with 2\nor 3 fingers. This must be done on a flat surface.\no  For mildly hard reeds, the reed can be lowered slightly on the mouthpiece so\nthat the thinner part of the reed is being played. Be aware, however, that this is\nonly a quick fix. The ligature can also be moved slightly lower on the\nreed/mouthpiece, if necessary.\no  For slightly harder reeds, sand down the flat part of the reed with 600 grit sand\npaper (or finer). The reed must then be polished.\no  For very hard reeds:\n(cid:2)  Determine which side of the reed is harder.\n(cid:2)  Play on the left and right side to see which side is more difficult to\nproduce a sound on.\n(cid:2)  Use a reed knife and scrape off wood from both sides surrounding the\nheart. Do not scrape off the tip or the heart of the reed. Remove\nmore cane from the thicker side.  Be very careful not to scrape off too\nmuch.\no  Again, only an experienced lesson teacher or a very knowledgeable band\ndirector should be scraping reeds.\no  Try pushing on the tip of the reed with the thumb while it is on the\nmouthpiece. Close the tip opening and then press a little more 2-3 times.\nCheck to see if the reed is softer.\no  Ask an older/more experienced private lesson teachers for even more tricks\nthat may be out there!\no  Sometimes a student is simply dealing with a bad reed………and throwing it\naway is easier than the frustration it will cause………let alone the many\nattempts to fix/adjust the reed.

    "text": "CHARACTERISTICS WHEN RECRUITING AND\nSELECTING SAXOPHONE PLAYERS\nPhysical Characteristics/Factors\n•  As the embouchure is rather simple to form correctly, many students are able to play\nsaxophone with the exception of those that have severe underbites.\n•  Unlike playing flute and high brass instruments, having braces or teeth abnormalities does\n•\nnot hinder students playing saxophone.\nIt is actually acceptable to recruit students on saxophone who are double-jointed, because the\nsize of the instrument and the strength of the key springs support the fingers more than\nsmaller woodwind instruments.\n•  There are fewer physical characteristic factors when considering saxophone than most other\nwoodwind instruments.\nNon-Physical Characteristics/Factors\n•  The alto saxophone is the most expensive student-owned instrument; thus, use the cost to\nlimit the class size.\n•  Parents need to understand that the monthly cost can be anywhere from $50-$70 per month—\nexcluding the maintenance kit.\n•  As much as possible, avoid placing students on saxophone whose family would have\nproblems supporting the cost of the instrument, upkeep and accessories.  (Consider single-\nparent families.)\n•  Even though it is easy to place students on saxophone, it should not be treated as a “dumping\nground.”  Depending on the number of returning students, the goal should be to allow\nbetween six to nine students in your saxophone class.\n•  Try to have a separate class for your saxophones. If this can not happen, combine the\nsaxophone class with your double reed class. Your double reed class will move as fast—if\nnot faster—than your saxophone class.\nIf combined with double reed students, find a private teacher or a specialist to periodically\ninstruct your saxophone students. If a specialist cannot be found for your saxophone students,\nfind a specialist/private teacher for your double reed students and pull those students out\nperiodically.\n•  DO NOT combine your saxophone class with your flute or clarinet classes. Flute and clarinet\nclasses will move much slower than your saxophone class because of the amount of time\nspent on the embouchure, hand position and flexibility (flute). Your saxophone students will\nbecome bored and possibly cause classroom management problems.\n•  The saxophone class needs to be taught in a smaller room. Not only will you be able to limit\nthe class size to 6-9 students, but you will find it easier to dissuade pushy\nparents/administrators from trying to force additional students into the class. Place your\nsaxophone class opposite a larger class like trumpet, clarinet, or flute. Place the larger class\nin the band hall and the saxophone class in a smaller room.\n•  Allowing a student to play the tenor saxophone in a beginner class should only be allowed\nunder extreme financial circumstances…..or with an unexpected move-in that allowed the\nstudent to play tenor saxophone at their previous school.  If you have a tenor saxophone\nplayer in your beginning class, give the student an alto saxophone book as well…..so that the\nstudent is playing “off a 4th” from the rest of the class.  You will then be able to monitor the\nstudent’s tone quality, articulation and accuracy of notes and rhythms more successfully.\nThings to look for when switching alto saxophone players to tenor/baritone\nsaxophone\n•  Students who have met/exceeded practice card requirements in the past\n•  Students who show a genuine interest and are excited to play a lower saxophone\n•  Students with high academic records\n•  Students who demonstrate a willingness to continue playing tenor/baritone saxophone during\nhigh school unless asked to switch back to the alto saxophone by a high school\ndirector……or students who are considering a music major in college\n•  Students willing to take the instruments home\no  Using a small dolly or luggage cart with two wheels and bungee cords\n•  Students with taller/bigger statures (especially for baritone saxophone)\nMiscellaneous\n•  When switching students to lower saxophones, take advantage of the opportunity to ask the\nparents about starting their child on private lessons.  You may need to offer some sort of\nfinancial assistance.\no  Inform the parents that in most cases, monthly lesson costs may be less than the\nmonthly alto saxophone rental costs would have been!\n•  A tenor saxophone can augment/enhance a small and/or weak French\nhorn/trombone/euphonium section.\n•  A baritone saxophone can augment/enhance a tuba section.\n•  Saxophone mouthpieces are all different, but the fingerings are all the same.\n•  Do not use a tenor saxophone/baritone saxophone section as a “dumping ground” for bad alto\nsaxophone players.\n•  Private lesson teachers must challenge low saxophone players in their lessons, simply\nbecause their ensemble music is not challenging with respect to technique and range.\n•  Do NOT assign a student to tenor/baritone saxophone (or any other instrument) and send\nthem in a practice room alone to “figure out” how to play the new instrument without any\nassistance/guidance (cid:1).\no  If you are not able or confident enough to help the student, then it is your job to\nfind someone that can teach them!"

Try to arrange it so students only buy reeds from the school.  Be sure the\nparents know that by purchasing the reeds from the school, they will receive a\n“___ percent” discount.  Make arrangements with your road man to facilitate this\nprocess.\nReed Strength\n•  Reeds generally come in half strength. Strengths that are offered vary by\nmanufacturer.\no  Strength is relative to the thickness of the reed. For example, a 2½ reed is\nthinner than a 3.\no  Larger strength reeds require more air; therefore, it is vital that beginners start\non a 2 or 2½, because they are still learning how to use their air properly. It is\nimportant to know that some reed manufacturers produce 1 and 1½ strength\nreeds!!!!! NOW….. considering the fact that professionals generally play\nbetween 3½ to 5 strength reeds, it would naturally make sense that MS/JH\nstudents not be playing on these stronger reeds!!!!!!!!\no  Reed strength is also dependent on the climate and player’s preference.\no  REFRAIN FROM PRESENTING THE “BADGE OF HONOR”\nPHILOSOPHY:\nFor example, if your students are playing on 2½ strength reeds in their\nbeginner class, they should not be told that they will advance to a 3 strength\nreed their second year…to a 3½ strength reed their third year…etc. You must\ncarefully base your decision to advance a student’s reed strength on the\nfollowing characteristics:\n1.  How students look—do their faces look natural when they are playing?\n2.  How students use their air—if they are not using air correctly, they will\nnot have success on any reed strength.\n3.  How students sound—is their sound stuffy?  Do you hear more air than\ntonal resonance in their sound?\nIf a clinician or mentor, after hearing your students, suggests a softer\nreed strength, students should be trained to accept this professional\nadvice. It is your job (as well as experienced private teachers if\napplicable) to closely monitor each individual student, as they will be\nplaying and developing at different levels. With that said, students\nshould move up a reed strength when the teachers feel it is time.\n•  It is perfectly acceptable for first/second year students to remain\non 2 or 2 ½ strength reeds for a long period of time. Second and\nthird year players may progress to 3 strength reeds as time goes by.\n•  Young band directors are encouraged to consult with an experienced\nprivate lesson teacher or band director/colleague when trying to make\ndecisions regarding appropriate times to advance reed strengths for\nstudents.\nReed Strengths Specifics Regarding Saxophone\n•  Most advanced alto saxophone players should remain on Vandoren 3s for classical\nsaxophone playing throughout the duration of their public school experience.\n•  MS/JH tenor and baritone saxophone players should begin on Vandoren 2 ½s.\n•  HS tenor saxophone players may progress to Vandoren 3s…maybe 3 ½s.\n•  HS baritone saxophone players may progress to Vandoren 3s.\nReed Qualities\n•  All reeds are hand-made. Every reed will sound different and will slightly vary in\nthickness as well as quality. The strength can be the same, but the individual cut will\nhave effects on the sound quality. Hard and soft does not refer to the actual reed\nstrength, but instead the individual cut of the reed. There are two distinct categories:\no  Hard\n(cid:1)  Thicker (more wood)\n(cid:1)  Requires more air\n(cid:1)  Requires a firmer embouchure\n(cid:1)  Can potentially allow students to bite more\n(cid:1)  Generally sounds airy/fuzzy, brittle, unclear, and is sharper in pitch\n(cid:1)  Playing with a hard reed can create tension in the face/embouchure, as\nwell as the jaw and neck.\no  Soft\n(cid:1)  Thinner (less wood)\n(cid:1)  The embouchure does not have to be as firm to produce a good sound.\n(cid:1)  Does not allow you to bite as much\n(cid:1)  The sound will be soft, honky, less resonant, unfocused, and\nsometimes spread.\n(cid:1)  Playing softly will be easier, but louder dynamics will have a bright\nsound. Louder dynamics will also be flat in pitch.\no  Try to find a medium “in between” reed that produces the best, desirable\nsound for each individual student.\nReed Life Cycle\n•  The cane is hand cut in the south of France in Var. Reeds are then individually\npackaged and shipped.\n•  Breaking in a reed (explained in Soaking, Breaking In and Adjusting Reeds\nhandout).\n•  Reeds that are rotated can last for 2-4 weeks depending on how much they are played\non.\no  The more a reed is played on, the softer it gets.\no  As reeds get older, they lose resonance.\no  If a reed is used too long in one sitting, the moisture that has been collecting\nin the pores of the reed will cause mold to build up.\n•  Reeds that are too thin and/or worn down from excessive use will become\nunacceptable in terms of quality and sound.\no  The response will be slow.\no  Vibrations will be slow.\no  The reed becomes thin and will produce an undesirable, spread sound.\no  Students will start to squeak on starts because the reed is harder to control.\no  MOLD will become visible.\no  These are all signs that a reed needs to be replaced.\nFinding a Good Reed\n•  Just because a reed is new, it does not mean that it will sound good.\n•  You can tell a good reed from a bad reed by sight.\no  Good reeds are yellow or crème colored on the heart.\no  Good reeds look “clean.”\no  Bad reeds have visible veins.\no  Bad reeds have a tip that is too transparent (this can be seen if a reed is held\nup to a light).\n•  You—as the teacher—reserve the right to tell a student that a reed can no longer be\nplayed.  Be professional and sensitive when telling a student a reed is bad and needs\nto be thrown away.  Parents should be made aware of this information before\ntheir child is officially recruited to play a single reed instrument.\n•  It is also important for parents to understand that as their child becomes more\nadvanced/experienced, their reeds can last longer…..AS LONG AS THE\nSTUDENTS ARE FOLLOWING ALL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN DURING\nCLASS!!  As this process evolves over time, reeds may not need to be purchased\nas often as they were when the students were first and second year players!\n•  You are encouraged to create a “Reed Graveyard” for students to deposit reeds that\nneed to be disposed of. This can be labeled and decorated as a motivating factor for\nstudents to want to deposit reeds… as opposed to leaving them on music stands, the\nfloor, or in their cases. (cid:2)\n•  To monitor quality of reeds, be sure to hear students play individually EVERY\nDAY…. regardless of their experience and/or playing ability.\nReed Guards and Reed Rotation\n•  Students must have reed guards with four completely broken in reeds.\n•  Students must be taught from the beginning to rotate each of their four reeds, which\nshould always be in their reed guard.\n•  Students should be trained to play on a DIFFERENT, BROKEN IN REED during\nevery class period/rehearsal or performance opportunity.  For example, a student\nshould not play on a reed more than one performance opportunity on any given day\n(exceptions—warm-ups and/or rehearsals prior to major individual or group\nauditions/performances).\n•  Reeds with chips, mold, etc., should never be played on—or even kept—in the reed\nguard. In addition, reeds that are too thin—or do not sound good for whatever\nreason—should never be kept in the reed guard.\n•  Reed guard checks should be daily in beginning classes at first. Daily grades should\nbe given when having a reed guard check. Each of the four reeds should be 25%.\n•  Reed guard checks can be periodic in MS/JH and HS ensembles as often as you feel\nnecessary.  Grades can be given as motivation.\n•  Reed guards should be accessible during daily rehearsals, as well as any off campus\nrehearsal, performance, contest, festival, etc. Reed guard accessibility pertains to\nthem being outside of their cases, not inside."

    "text": "SAXOPHONE HAND POSITION\nRIGHT HAND POSITION\n1.  Always place the right hand first. The left hand should grasp in a non-delicate\narea.\n2.  The second knuckle of the thumb should be placed under the right edge of the\nthumb rest.\n3.  Fingers should be placed on the pearls. The fleshy part will touch the pearls.\n4.  The little finger should rest on the roller keys. “Home position” will be the E-\nflat key, which is the higher of the two keys.\n5.  Fingers should remain on the pearls and be curved and round, and not ever go\npast the pearls (resulting in flat fingers).  Double-jointed students can extend\ntheir fingers “out”/past the pearls more as opposed to keeping them close to\nthe pearls.\n6.  The wrist must stay in line with the rest of the forearm. The wrist should not\ncollapse into the side keys.\n7.  Practice moving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles. Do not let the\nother two knuckles move.  The finger pads should stay on the pearls at all\ntimes. In the beginning the little finger can move up and down also.\n8.  Do not include side keys in the initial hand position information. If asked, tell\nthem once the hands can move correctly using the pearls, they will be allowed\nto learn to use the keys on the side.\nLEFT HAND POSITION\n** While teaching left hand position, the right hand can gently grasp the bell.\n1.  The left thumb rests on the back thumb rest and never leaves.  The second\nknuckle should basically be in the middle of the thumb rest.\n2.  Place the index finger on the first pearl.  The Yamaha YAS-23 and other\nbrands feature an extra pearl, or “teardrop key” which will need to be skipped.\n3.  Skip the small pearl (bis key).\n4.  Place the middle and ring finger on the next two pearls.  The finger pads\nshould stay on the pearls at all times.\n5.  The pinky should rest on the “home key,” which is the G#/Ab key.  The pinky\nshould not be straight; it needs to be curved. Watch for pinkies that disappear\neither under the saxophone or under the pinky keys.\n6.  Fingers should remain on the pearls and be curved and round, and not ever go\npast the pearls (resulting in flat fingers). As stated earlier, double-jointed\nstudents can extend their fingers “out”/past the pearls more as opposed to\nkeeping them close to the pearls.\n7.  Keep the hand in an adjusted “flat-C” position and the wrist slightly up.  The\nwrist must stay in line with the rest of the forearm.\n8.  Always feel the palm of the hands to check for the softness of the fingers.\nThere are more bones in this area of the hand than any other part of the body.\nIf the palm is soft, all other parts of the hand will be as naturally soft as is\npossible.  The little fingers should have comfortable “home keys” they touch\nall of the time in the beginning stages.\nFINGER EXERCISES\n1.  All fingers in each hand move together.  Call out the hand you wish to move.\nThe students move all of the fingers in that hand down never leaving the\npearls.  The right hand thumb obviously does not ever move when the teacher\nasks for “RIGHT”, but the left hand thumb can move with the fingers of the\nleft hand when the teacher asks for “LEFT”.\n2.  Next, we move the fingers one at a time beginning with the left hand.  The\nthumb and first finger are already down in this exercise, and each additional\nfinger in both hands will be numbered two through six from top of the body to\nthe bottom of the body. The fingers will move down or up depending on their\nstarting position, as the number is called by the teacher.  We do not use the\nlittle fingers when we first begin this exercise.\n3.  Watch the fingers to see that they move smoothly in constant contact with the\npearls, in natural position and move up and down from the big knuckle only.\nThe student should understand that the movement is aided by the soft tissue of\nthe palm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand.\n4.  Constantly watch and monitor students who have “fly-away-fingers”… as\nwell as unused fingers pressing into “used” fingers. To avoid “fly-away-\nfingers”, use double-sided tape, which is safe to put on the pearls.\n5.  Next, we move the fingers in combinations: one, two….one, two\nthree…….one, two, three, four……one, two, three, four, five…..one, two,\nthree, four, five, six………six, five, four, three, two, one……five, four, three,\ntwo, one…….four, three, two, one……three, two, one………two, one……\nLater the development of moving the first and second finger separately is\nadded.\n6.  Using these exercises, the fingers move in all of the ways they move to play\nthe saxophone: all together, one at a time, and in combinations.  This exercise\nwill be demonstrated.\n7.  Refer to your supplemental page regarding exercises to perfect the usage of\nthe roller keys and palm keys.  These exercises must not be introduced too\nearly in the development of a student’s hand position."

    "text": "SAXOPHONE EMBOUCHURE\n•  Students must be able to use air correctly before beginning to learn the\nsaxophone embouchure.\n•  Use the neck and mouthpiece for better control.\n•  The  teacher  should  place  the  neck  and  mouthpiece  in  the  beginning.    Place  the\nbottom lip first, then the upper teeth and top lip.\n•  The student needs to remember how it feels and sounds.\n•  Once the teacher has demonstrated how it feels and sounds, the\nstudent can hold the neck and mouthpiece in place and watch\nhis  face  in  a  mirror  to  make  sure  nothing  moves  or  looks  unnatural.    Then,  the\nstudent remembers how it looks, feels and sounds.\nIt  is  best  to  hold  the  neck  and  mouthpiece  with  two  fingers  and  a  thumb  in  a\nbalanced  manner.    The  fingers  should  have  absolutely  no  contact  with  the\nmouthpiece or ligature.\n•\n•  The mouthpiece is held by the teeth, not the lips.\n•  The upper teeth rest on the mouthpiece material (patch).\n•  The lower teeth feel the reed through the lower lip that covers them.\n•  The lower lip covers the lower teeth like a fitted sheet covers a mattress.\n•  The back teeth are naturally apart.\n•  The  tongue  is  in  the  “ah”  or  “ew”  position…..and  not  pulled  back.    For  tenor\nsaxophone,  the  tongue  is  in  the  “ah”  position,  and  “oh”  for  the  baritone\nsaxophone.\n•  Using the index finger, gently push the lower lip toward, but not rolled\nover the lower teeth.  Lick the part that goes over.  That is the correct amount.\n•  The  saxophone  embouchure  is  created  with  a  natural  overbite  position  with  a\nslight valley in the chin.\n•  The  corners  are  toward  the  mouthpiece.    Ultimately,  the  corners  will  be  toward\nthe mouthpiece and down.\n•  There should be no wrinkles in the lower lip and red flesh must be seen\non either side of the mouthpiece.\n•  The lower lip that is not under the reed stays in front of the teeth.\n•  Never tell students to pull their lips over their teeth.  Pulling and stretching makes\nlips thicker.\n•  The upper lip rests on top of the mouthpiece in front of the upper teeth.\n•  The upper lip should be soft and pliable, and follow the shape/contour of the\nmouthpiece.\n•  Both the top and bottom lip should always feel soft and natural.\n•  There should be no lines or dimples that do not appear in the natural face.  The\nface essentially should be “zombie”-like.\n•  The air is directed through an imaginary dot, which is at the center of the\nmouthpiece and reed.\n•  Enough mouthpiece must be past the lips into the chamber of the mouth to allow\nthe reed to freely vibrate.  Usually less than half the mouthpiece is sufficient.\n•  There must be a resonant second space treble clef concert A-flat sounded.\nIf the sound is stuffy, the student may be holding the mouthpiece with the lips.\nIf the sound is strident and brittle, the student may have too much mouthpiece\nin his mouth or may be using too much unfocused air.\n•  Be sure the student can control the air well enough to find the correct balance of\nair and resistance to create the sound you want on the neck and mouthpiece.\n•  Remember that the mouth can be too open; the teeth can be out of position; the\nlips can be too loose and puffy or can grip; the tongue can be too far back in the\nmouth; the student can be lifting too little.  All of these will result in a sound you\nwill not wish to create.\n•  Keep making subtle adjustments to the angle, amount of mouthpiece taken, etc.\nJust a slight movement can really improve the resonance of the vibration.\n•  Keep the body and face calm and still while learning this embouchure.\n•  The embouchure is a constant work in progress.  Special attention should be given\nto the contact of the upper teeth with the mouthpiece material.  The teacher can\nattempt to move the mouthpiece out of position to make the student aware that\nsomething is incorrect.\nIt is easier to make something firmer than to get rid of unnecessary tightness.\nIf the sound is not clear, instant and resonant on the neck and mouthpiece, the\nsound on the saxophone will not be resonant and beautiful.\n•  When the neck and mouthpiece is placed on the body of the saxophone, the first\nattempt at sound production should be made with the teacher’s assistance.\nIf a student plays above pitch, they may be biting down on their mouthpiece or the\nmouthpiece may be too far in the mouth.  If a student is below pitch, their air may\nbe too slow, their embouchure may be too loose, or their mouthpiece may be out\ntoo far.\nQualities of Uncharacteristic Sounds and Their Causes\n•  Grainy sound:  tension in the mouth~~or “waterlogged” reed\n•  Buzzy sound:  reed is too hard~~or too much tension from the bottom lip\n•  Thin  sound:    reed  is  too  thin/soft~~or  not  enough  mouthpiece~~or  insufficient\namount of air\n•  Unfocused  sound:    too  much  mouthpiece~~or  uncontrolled  air~~or  too  soft  of  a\nreed\n•  No sound:  lower teeth not in contact with the bottom lip~~or reed too hard\n•  Flat sound:  corners not firm~~or cheeks uncontrolled (puffing) ~~or teeth not on\nthe mouthpiece"

    "text": "SAXOPHONE ARTICULATION EXERCISES\n•  When starting articulation exercises, the use of mirrors is vital.\n•  Remind students that the tongue only interrupts the air – it never stops the air.\n•  Articulating with black notes as opposed to white notes, encourages students to move\ntheir tongues down quicker.\n•  Make sure from the very beginning, students sing and play in a connected/legato style.\n•  Exercises to be taught in the following order:\n1.  Have students sing on “dah” and then ultimately on the French syllable “dih” or even\n“doo.” If students are unable to sing in a connected style, they should not progress to\nthe next step.\n2.  Have students put their hand or index finger in front of their face and feel their air.\nStudents should feel continuous air and not “puffs” of air.\n3.  Go around the room and have each student tongue air at your hand, so you can assess\ntheir ability to do it correctly.\n4.  Using a mirror, students should articulate with or without their hand/index finger,\nmaking sure that their face, chin, and throat are not moving.\n5.  When you feel students have mastered the previous exercises, allow them to articulate\n– using the syllable “dah” or “dih” – on the mouthpiece and neck.  Students should\nput their left hands under their neck so they can feel a continuous stream of air while\nthey are articulating.  Students who do not feel continuous air need to be verbally\nmade aware that they are not articulating correctly.\n** Students should start with their tongue on the reed to create the articulation.\nThe tongue then falls down and returns to its “at rest” position in the bottom of the\nmouth.  One taste bud of the student’s tongue should touch the flat part of the reed,\nwhere the imaginary “dot” at the tip has been all along.  The air and tongue go to\nthis same “dot.”\n6.  Allow students to articulate as fast as they can.\n7.  Allow the students to start the sound and use the \"ta-day\" syllable.\n8.  Allow the students to start the sound and articulate by snapping your finger on\ncommand.\n9.  With the metronome, begin to incorporate easy follow-the-leader rhythms with you\nsinging or modeling – and the students echoing on their mouthpiece and neck.  Whole\nrests may or may not be necessary between you and the students.  As with your initial\nsound production exercises, students need to continue counting with their fingers –\nwith their left hand – while they are playing.  This ensures that students are thinking\ninternal subdivision.\n10. Before progressing to the fully-assembled saxophone, assign the following playing\ntest on the mouthpiece and neck:\n•  Attach the mouthpiece and neck to the saxophone and begin articulation.  Students must\nbe constantly reminded that they should be articulating in the same way as they were\nwhen just using the mouthpiece and neck.\n•  Whether students are playing white notes or black notes, they must constantly be\nreminded that the tongue moves down quickly.\n•  When students can successfully sing note names on the same pitch, allow them to\narticulate multiple notes on the same pitch.\n•  When pulse and foot pat are learned, students articulate every time their foot touches the\nfloor – and then when their foot touches the floor and as it comes up.\n•  Once the student is able to read music, call the articulation \"rhythmic articulation\".\nStudents should be tonguing as the music moves across the page.\n•  Do not allow students to articulate back-to-back notes on different pitches until they are\nplaying with absolute connected style on notes of the same pitch.\n•  When the tongue is moving correctly, you must decide when it is appropriate to have\nstudents begin coordinating finger movement with articulation.\n•  When students articulate back-to-back notes on different pitches, they cannot stop their\nair as they change fingerings.\n•  Teach Mary Had a Little Lamb in four segments by singing and then playing:\n•  After all students have successfully played each segment of Mary Had a Little Lamb,\nbegin to string together the segments into the following finished product:\n•  Ultimately, students should be able to execute any or all of the following on a daily basis:\no  articulate as fast as they can\no  articulate using the \"ta-day\" syllable\no  articulate on command\no  articulate with foot pat and articulate rhythms\n•  When playing exercises out of the method book, you can return to previously-learned\nlines and add articulation.  Do not feel like all lines must be executed again during class;\nassign students to perform all lines at home with articulation."

Metal resonators produce a brighter\n•  The newer Yamaha saxophones have highly improved key action, and\nare smoother to play and have a better “feel.”\n•  The Yamaha saxophones tend to be more consistent instruments due\nto the fact that they are machine-made as opposed to hand-made.\n•  In general “heavier” saxophones result in warmer/darker sounds, thus\nmaking it easier to play in terms of response and resistance.\n•  While the Yamaha alto saxophones are highly recommended, the\ntenor and baritone Selmer saxophones have a very good sound\nquality.\n•  Avoid the Yamaha “Custom Z” model. This model produces a\nbrighter sound, but has an easier lower register.\n•  For quality reasons, if possible, avoid the alto saxophone Selmer\nSuper Action 80 “Series III” with a harmonic mechanism. This\ninstrument has extra frills (an extra vent on the neck and key next to\nthe octave key) and is very expensive.  The “newer” it is, the more\nlikely it is to have something wrong with it.\n•  Avoid the Selmer “Mark VI” and “Mark VII,” which are no longer\nmade, but are “out there.”  These models are hand-made, have a\ndarker sound, have heavier key action and are not recommended.\n•  Regarding  Mark VI alto saxophones:  these instruments were\nmanufactured between 1958-1967 and currently cost around $6000;\nthus, they are obviously considered professional models.  Although\nsome may say this instrument has the most desirable sound quality,\nothers would argue that point and say they are very difficult to play.\nThe Mark VI is a great saxophone for jazz playing, but not for\nclassical/ensemble playing.\n•  Yanagisawa saxophones are a good brand for alto saxophones, and\nparticularly for baritone saxophones. Yanisagawa will eventually be\nan “up and coming” brand. This brand would be a very acceptable\nsubstitution for the more expensive brands (i.e. Selmer).\n•  Keilworth produces acceptable tenor saxophones; however, their alto\nsaxophones are not as consistent.\n•  Saxophone necks greatly affect tone and intonation; with that said, a\ndamaged saxophone neck is going to affect the playability of that\ninstrument greatly. Yamaha V1 alto and tenor saxophone necks are\nexcellent and affordable (MSRP $422.00 and $618.00 respectively).\nSelmer Rose Brass necks are even more affordable and have great\nintonation and tone quality. Yamaha G3 necks are ideal for tenor\nsaxophone but are no longer manufactured and difficult to find. DO\nNOT MIX AND MATCH NECKS between the Series II and III\ninstruments."

The straight neck will produce a slightly\nbrighter tone and the curved neck will produce a slightly darker tone.\n•  Older instruments/cheaper models will have an attached neck.\n•  Some soprano saxophones will have a high G key.\n•  Almost every work written for concert band by Percy Grainger (i.e. Shepherd’s\nHey, Lincolnshire Posy, Mock Morris) will have a soprano saxophone part.\n•  Used in: The Planets and “Song Without Words” from Second Suite in F for\nMilitary Band by Holst; Bolero by Ravel (the original orchestral arrangement)\n•  Used in most contemporary pieces written by John Mackey\n•  A student-owned instrument\n•  Sounds a major 6th lower than written\n•  Sounds one octave lower than Eb sopranino saxophone\n•  Students should begin instruction on the alto saxophone.\n•  Step-up instruments cost about $4,000 (MSRP $5,700)\n•  The professional alto saxophone models will have the options of high F#/Gb keys.\n•  The alto saxophone is accepted as part of standard concert band instrumentation.\n•  A school-owned instrument in most cases\n•  Longer than an Eb alto saxophone\n•  Sounds one octave and one whole step lower than written\n•  Sounds one octave below Bb soprano saxophone\n•  Should be used in middle school and high school, but not during the beginner year\n•  Costs about $7,600 (MSRP $10,750)\n•  The professional tenor saxophone models will have the options of high F#/Gb\nkeys.\n•  The tenor saxophone is accepted as part of standard concert band instrumentation,\nbut if your ensemble does not have a tenor saxophonist, the part may be played\ndirectly on a Bb bass clarinet with no part re-writing necessary.\n•  The embouchure must be more relaxed/flexible.\n•  Students with larger oral cavities tend to be more successful on the instrument.\n•  Tenor saxophones will have the option of a high F#/Gb key.\n•  Used in: Lieutenant Kijé by Prokofiev\n•  A school-owned instrument\n•  Sounds one octave and a major 6th lower than written\n•  Sounds one octave lower than Eb alto saxophone\n•  Costs about $13,500 (MSRP $20,000)\n•  Standard instrument for middle school and high school students, but not during\nthe beginning year\n•  Baritone saxophones have a spit valve key under the crook.\n•  Baritone saxophones have a low A key (the only instrument that has this feature);\ntherefore, there is more brass added to the instrument.\n•  Baritone saxophones will have the options of high F#/Gb and/or low A keys. The\nhigh F#/Gb key is not necessary, but the low A key is necessary in advanced\nmiddle school literature.\n•  While the part will be written in treble clef, scores will often notate the baritone\nsaxophone part in bass clef.\n•  Must be specifically ordered\n•  Sounds one octave lower than a tenor saxophone\n•  Sounds two octaves and one whole step lower than written\n•  Can be used in a high school band, but usually used in advanced college chamber\ngroups\n•  Costs about $22,000 (MSRP: $32,000)\n•  A baritone saxophone mouthpiece will fit on a bass saxophone neck, but a bass\nsaxophone mouthpiece with bass saxophone reeds (or bass clarinet reeds in a\npinch) will sound much better.\n•  Many Percy Grainger works have a bass saxophone part, but it is non-essential.\n•  Also used in Music for Prague by Karel Husa\n*The larger the instrument, the more susceptible they are to bent keys,\nbent rods and leaks.\nMiddle School and High School Inventory\n•  Tenor Saxophone\n•  Baritone Saxophone\nCHARACTERISTICS WHEN RECRUITING AND\nSELECTING SAXOPHONE PLAYERS\nPhysical Characteristics/Factors\n•  As the embouchure is rather simple to form correctly, many students are able to play\nsaxophone with the exception of those that have severe underbites.\n•  Unlike playing flute and high brass instruments, having braces or teeth abnormalities does\n•\nnot hinder students playing saxophone.\nIt is actually acceptable to recruit students on saxophone who are double-jointed, because the\nsize of the instrument and the strength of the key springs support the fingers more than\nsmaller woodwind instruments.\n•  There are fewer physical characteristic factors when considering saxophone than most other\nwoodwind instruments.\nNon-Physical Characteristics/Factors\n•  The alto saxophone is the most expensive student-owned instrument; thus, use the cost to\nlimit the class size.\n•  Parents need to understand that the monthly cost can be anywhere from $50-$70 per month—\nexcluding the maintenance kit.\n•  As much as possible, avoid placing students on saxophone whose family would have\nproblems supporting the cost of the instrument, upkeep and accessories.  (Consider single-\nparent families.)\n•  Even though it is easy to place students on saxophone, it should not be treated as a “dumping\nground.”  Depending on the number of returning students, the goal should be to allow\nbetween six to nine students in your saxophone class.\n•  Try to have a separate class for your saxophones. If this can not happen, combine the\nsaxophone class with your double reed class. Your double reed class will move as fast—if\nnot faster—than your saxophone class.\nIf combined with double reed students, find a private teacher or a specialist to periodically\ninstruct your saxophone students. If a specialist cannot be found for your saxophone students,\nfind a specialist/private teacher for your double reed students and pull those students out\nperiodically.\n•  DO NOT combine your saxophone class with your flute or clarinet classes. Flute and clarinet\nclasses will move much slower than your saxophone class because of the amount of time\nspent on the embouchure, hand position and flexibility (flute). Your saxophone students will\nbecome bored and possibly cause classroom management problems.\n•  The saxophone class needs to be taught in a smaller room. Not only will you be able to limit\nthe class size to 6-9 students, but you will find it easier to dissuade pushy\nparents/administrators from trying to force additional students into the class. Place your\nsaxophone class opposite a larger class like trumpet, clarinet, or flute. Place the larger class\nin the band hall and the saxophone class in a smaller room.\n•  Allowing a student to play the tenor saxophone in a beginner class should only be allowed\nunder extreme financial circumstances…..or with an unexpected move-in that allowed the\nstudent to play tenor saxophone at their previous school.  If you have a tenor saxophone\nplayer in your beginning class, give the student an alto saxophone book as well…..so that the\nstudent is playing “off a 4th” from the rest of the class.  You will then be able to monitor the\nstudent’s tone quality, articulation and accuracy of notes and rhythms more successfully.\nThings to look for when switching alto saxophone players to tenor/baritone\nsaxophone\n•  Students who have met/exceeded practice card requirements in the past\n•  Students who show a genuine interest and are excited to play a lower saxophone\n•  Students with high academic records\n•  Students who demonstrate a willingness to continue playing tenor/baritone saxophone during\nhigh school unless asked to switch back to the alto saxophone by a high school\ndirector……or students who are considering a music major in college\n•  Students willing to take the instruments home\no  Using a small dolly or luggage cart with two wheels and bungee cords\n•  Students with taller/bigger statures (especially for baritone saxophone)\nMiscellaneous\n•  When switching students to lower saxophones, take advantage of the opportunity to ask the\nparents about starting their child on private lessons.  You may need to offer some sort of\nfinancial assistance.\no  Inform the parents that in most cases, monthly lesson costs may be less than the\nmonthly alto saxophone rental costs would have been!\n•  A tenor saxophone can augment/enhance a small and/or weak French\nhorn/trombone/euphonium section.\n•  A baritone saxophone can augment/enhance a tuba section.\n•  Saxophone mouthpieces are all different, but the fingerings are all the same.\n•  Do not use a tenor saxophone/baritone saxophone section as a “dumping ground” for bad alto\nsaxophone players.\n•  Private lesson teachers must challenge low saxophone players in their lessons, simply\nbecause their ensemble music is not challenging with respect to technique and range.\n•  Do NOT assign a student to tenor/baritone saxophone (or any other instrument) and send\nthem in a practice room alone to “figure out” how to play the new instrument without any\nassistance/guidance (cid:1).\no  If you are not able or confident enough to help the student, then it is your job to\nfind someone that can teach them!\nBEGINNING SAXOPHONE CLASSROOM AND\nENSEMBLE SET-UP\nBeginning Classroom Set-Up\n•  Your beginning saxophone class should be taught in a smaller room (i.e. ensemble room\nor secondary band hall).\n•  Configure your classroom based on how many students you have in the class.\n•  Start off the semester by putting students in alphabetical order so you can learn their\nnames faster.  Once music stands and mirrors are utilized in class, hanging name tags can\ncontinue to help you learn student names quicker. These can and should also be used on\nany days you have clinicians/consultants visit.\nTypes of Band Hall Set-Ups\n1.  Arched set-up\n(cid:1)\nIf using your “ensemble set-up” for your class, have students sit in a “box,” so all\nstudents receive the same amount of attention/eye contact from you.\n(cid:1)  Have students sit in every other chair (if all chairs have to remain in your set-up\nthroughout the day).\n(cid:1)  The aisles between your rows must be large enough so that you will have quick and\neasy access to any student--both from the front and the back.\n(cid:1)  As much as possible, have students in “windows.”\n(cid:1)  You must be able to see each student from the front and the back.  With that said, you\nare not always able to correct student’s posture, hand position, etc. from the front of\nthe room; thus, you need to be walking around the room instead of “parking” on a\nstool!\n(cid:1)  Once you start determining playing ability levels of your students, place weaker\nplayers in the front of the classroom and stronger players in the back. Less attention is\ntypically given to players who are further back in the set-up.\n2.  Horseshoe set-up\n(cid:1)  This set-up is not recommended because you have a limited range of vision.\nIf you decide to use this set-up, you will need to pull the stand/podium far enough\nback in order to have clear vision of every student.\n3.  Arched with aisle\n(cid:1)  This is a very acceptable set-up, even with full ensembles.\n4.  Straight line set-up\n(cid:1)  This type of set-up should only be used with bigger facilities.\nIn order for you to have visual contact with all of the students, the students on the\nends of the rows will have to adjust their chairs/ bodies towards you or you need to\nhave them sitting in a “box” (see arched set-up).\n5.  Straight line set-up with aisle\nAISLE\n6.  Circular set up\n(cid:1)  One teacher teaches from the inside and one from the periphery. Students face in\ntowards middle.\nIf you are teaching alone, it will be too hard to maneuver when teaching outside of\nthe circle.\n(cid:1)  This set-up is typical in elementary school cafeterias or small stage “cafetoriums.”\nEnsemble Room Set-Up\n•  Beginner Classroom set-up\n•  Remember: 90% of tone holes are on the right side of the instrument\nFull Ensemble Set-Up\n•  Saxophone players need to be in the middle of the ensemble. The first chair alto\nsaxophone player should be near the 1st French horn player so they can more easily\nbalance and match in terms of balance, pitch, etc.\nAlto Sax\n1\n2\n3\nTS\nBS\nHorns\n•  There should be a pod of low woodwinds—who should be sitting relatively close to each\nother--since these instruments tend to have similar parts in their music.\n•  Low saxophone players should never be placed with the low brass in the back of the\nensemble…regardless of whether or not risers are utilized.\nTrombone\nTuba\nB Sax  T Sax (cid:2)\nLow Saxes\nLow Clar.\nBassoons\nClar.\nFlutes\nSaxophone Quartet\nUniversity of Houston Set-up\nAS                     BS\nAS\nSS\nOR\nSS                              TS\nAudience\n•  The set-up should always form an arc with all players. This makes communication easier\nsince standing on the outside would place them in the blind spot of the other two\nmusicians.\n•  The two inner voices (alto and tenor) should not stand next to each other. This helps with\nbalance and prevents these two voices from getting lost in complex passages or in\nsituations where they function as a solo voice.\n•  All players should be angling their bodies and instruments in towards the audience.\n•  The set-up is subject to change depending on the strengths and weaknesses of each player\nas well as the repertoire being performed.\nRECOMMENDED SAXOPHONE BRANDS\nAlto Saxophone\nBeginner:\nBrand: Yamaha**\nModel: YAS-26 (formerly YAS-23)\nPricing:\nMSRP $2040.00 - wwbw.com\nMSRP $2040.00 - musicarts.com\nMonthly Rental Price:\n$61.00 (including insurance) - Music & Arts Center\n•  Rent-to-Own\n•  All payments go toward the instrument\n•  Parents can do a “trade-in” to a step-up instrument--$100 off sale\nprice of new instrument\no  Will be encouraged to pay off instrument and use as marching\no  Keep in mind that a re-pad job on an alto saxophone can be\nbetween $100-$150 and unfortunately “changes” the\ninstrument.\nDescription:\n•  Great beginner saxophone\n•  Can be used through high school\n•  Mid-grade construction quality (pearls tend to fall off if ill-treated) in\nregard to materials\n•  Machine-manufactured (as opposed to hand-made)\n•  Great for use as a marching saxophone (in better financial situations)\n•  No high F# key\n**Yamaha alto saxophones are moisture-prone due to the coating inside of\nthe instrument;

Metal resonators produce a brighter\n•  The newer Yamaha saxophones have highly improved key action, and\nare smoother to play and have a better “feel.”\n•  The Yamaha saxophones tend to be more consistent instruments due\nto the fact that they are machine-made as opposed to hand-made.\n•  In general “heavier” saxophones result in warmer/darker sounds, thus\nmaking it easier to play in terms of response and resistance.\n•  While the Yamaha alto saxophones are highly recommended, the\ntenor and baritone Selmer saxophones have a very good sound\nquality.\n•  Avoid the Yamaha “Custom Z” model. This model produces a\nbrighter sound, but has an easier lower register.\n•  For quality reasons, if possible, avoid the alto saxophone Selmer\nSuper Action 80 “Series III” with a harmonic mechanism. This\ninstrument has extra frills (an extra vent on the neck and key next to\nthe octave key) and is very expensive.  The “newer” it is, the more\nlikely it is to have something wrong with it.\n•  Avoid the Selmer “Mark VI” and “Mark VII,” which are no longer\nmade, but are “out there.”  These models are hand-made, have a\ndarker sound, have heavier key action and are not recommended.\n•  Regarding  Mark VI alto saxophones:  these instruments were\nmanufactured between 1958-1967 and currently cost around $6000;\nthus, they are obviously considered professional models.  Although\nsome may say this instrument has the most desirable sound quality,\nothers would argue that point and say they are very difficult to play.\nThe Mark VI is a great saxophone for jazz playing, but not for\nclassical/ensemble playing.\n•  Yanagisawa saxophones are a good brand for alto saxophones, and\nparticularly for baritone saxophones. Yanisagawa will eventually be\nan “up and coming” brand. This brand would be a very acceptable\nsubstitution for the more expensive brands (i.e. Selmer).\n•  Keilworth produces acceptable tenor saxophones; however, their alto\nsaxophones are not as consistent.\n•  Saxophone necks greatly affect tone and intonation; with that said, a\ndamaged saxophone neck is going to affect the playability of that\ninstrument greatly. Yamaha V1 alto and tenor saxophone necks are\nexcellent and affordable (MSRP $422.00 and $618.00 respectively).\nSelmer Rose Brass necks are even more affordable and have great\nintonation and tone quality. Yamaha G3 necks are ideal for tenor\nsaxophone but are no longer manufactured and difficult to find. DO\nNOT MIX AND MATCH NECKS between the Series II and III\ninstruments.\nRECOMMENDED SAXOPHONE\nMOUTHPIECES AND LIGATURES\nAlto Saxophone Mouthpieces\nBrand:  Vandoren Optimum\nModel: AL3\nPricing: MSRP $232.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  Made of hard rubber\n•  Smaller mouthpiece\n•  More circular chamber\n•  Sound is easier to control\n•  More responsive\n•  Has a tendency to wear out with hard use after\nseveral years\n•  The Vandoren AL4 mouthpiece is typically to be avoided, but is still a\ngood crossover mouthpiece for classical/ensemble and jazz playing.\nBrand:  Selmer\nModel: S-80 Series\nPricing: MSRP $281.00 @ wwbw.com\n•  C* is the recommended facing.

It will\naffect the rental price of the saxophone.\n•  Metal mouthpieces for middle school and high school students, with\nthe exception of advanced jazz players\no  A private lesson teacher should be the one to suggest a metal\nmouthpiece to a more advanced student who is in your jazz\nensemble. Metal mouthpieces should not be used under any\nother circumstances.\n•  Students are recommended to keep their “beginner” mouthpiece and\nligature if and when they move to a step-up instrument, so they can\nuse them for marching band.\n•  Selmer “Soloist” mouthpieces\no  Chamber of mouthpiece is too large\nLigatures to avoid:\n•  Rovner and BG leather\no  Eats up the sound\no  Produces a darker, non-resonant sound\no  Prohibits reed vibration\no  Does not hold the reed properly, resulting in the ligature\nslipping\no  Material stretches over time\n***If you do use these ligatures, the fabric is on the side of the reed and\nthe screw is on the right.\nHow to store the mouthpiece and ligature:\n•  Do not allow students to leave:\no  the reed they are currently playing on the mouthpiece\no  the assembled mouthpiece and ligature in the case\nThis usually happens because students are lazy or not given enough\ntime to clean their instruments. (cid:1)\n•  Do NOT allow students to simply store the assembled  mouthpiece\nand ligature in the case!\n•  Ideal way to store the mouthpiece/ligature:\no  Students should put an unused, dry reed (that has never been\nplayed on before) on their mouthpiece which is secured by the\nligature while it is stored.  Tighten the screw to its first point of\nresistance.  This prevents the ligature from losing shape and the\nface of the mouthpiece being scratched.\no  Students should have a plastic mouthpiece cap over the\nmouthpiece/reed/ligature while in the case at all times.  Caps\nprotect the entire “set-up.”\nCleaning the mouthpiece:\n•  After EACH CLASS, students need to use the end of their silk swab\nto dry out the receiver and tip of the mouthpiece.  It is recommended\nto use the pinky so that it can fit into the receiver and the tip.\n•  At home, students are recommended to clean the inside of the\nmouthpiece by using a damp cloth with warm running water and\nantibacterial soap.\n•  At home, students are recommended to clean the outside of the\nmouthpiece by putting it in a tea/coffee cup with water and lemon\njuice or vinegar. The mouthpiece can be submerged. This should be\ndone at least 1-2 times a year for 30 minutes. Be aware that the\nexterior of the mouthpiece can turn brown/yellow/green for 1-2\nweeks, because of the sulfur in the rubber.\n•  When cleaning the outsides of mouthpieces, students should be very\ncareful not to scratch the mouthpiece with any hard brushes, sponges\nor “other” things (ligature, pencil, pen, etc.).\n•  DO NOT BOIL THE MOUTHPIECE OR USE HOT WATER TO\nCLEAN IT! It is hard rubber, and will be destroyed!\nNECK STRAPS\nFor all saxophones, having the proper neck strap is very important. The\nproper neck strap is not only important for comfort, but also to ensure the\ninstrument is being played correctly.\n•  The neck strap affects the way students play the instrument.\no  Hand position\no  Angle of the instrument into the mouth\no  Ability to use air correctly\no  Posture\nGeneral Neck Strap Information\n•  Avoid “spongy/stretchy” neck straps, such as the Neotech neck straps.\no  the older the neck strap gets, the more the materials stretch out\no  does not create ease when holding instrument correctly\no  hard to place height correctly\n•  Try to use neck straps without excess padding.\no  Alto saxophone players can use the “stock” neck straps that\ncome with the instruments, which cost between $10-$15.\no  For tenor saxophone and bari saxophone players, some padding\nmay be necessary for comfort with younger students, because\nthese instruments are heavier. These cost between $10-$15.\nAvoid neoprene material (same material Neotech neck straps\nare made of).\no  For young bari saxophone players, a harness may be necessary.\nThese cost around $25. Again, try to avoid neoprene material.\n“spongy/stretchy”\nneoprene neck straps to\navoid\nAcceptable bari saxophone harness\nRecommended regular neck\nstrap with a reliable hook—\nmetal is not recommended\nbecause it scratches the\ninstrument\nAcceptable, more cotton-like\npadded neckstrap for tenor\nand bari player’s comfort\nSAXOPHONE MAINTENANCE KIT LIST -\nRECOMMENDED ITEMS\nVandoren Traditional Alto Saxophone\nReeds\nMSRP $54.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  These reeds come individually wrapped\nin cellophane because their quality\nfluctuates due to climate changes.\n•  Students are encouraged to unwrap all\nthe reeds in the box to allow the reeds to\nadjust to the climate.\n**See additional handout regarding packaging.\nVandoren Mouthpiece Patches\nPackage of 6: MSRP $16.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  Patches are flat, clear, and inexpensive\n•  Preferred over the Runyon rubber\npatches, which are spongy and add\nheight to the mouthpiece\nIdeal for students who have braces or\nare getting braces\n•  Keeps teeth from slipping off the\nmouthpiece and does not dampen the\nvibration as much as the Runyon\npatches\n•  Over time, teeth marks will appear\nmaking the student more aware of how\nmuch mouthpiece to use.\n•  Recommended for use in marching\nband\nOne of the following reed guards can be chosen depending on socio-economic environment,\navailability, or preference.\nVandoren Reed Guard\nHolds 6 - $54.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  The de-humidifier can cause the reeds\nto dry out very quickly and become\nwarped, or cause the moisture to linger\nand grow mold.\n•  Each reed slot is already numbered with\ndots.\n•  Tips of the reeds face toward the bottom\nof the reed case to prevent students\nfrom damaging the tips of the reeds.\n•  Does not include a de-humidifier\n•  Tips of the reeds face toward the hinges\nto prevent students from touching the\ntips of the reeds.\nVito Reed Guard\nMSRP $4.00 @wwbw.com\n•  Vito is another type of reed guard that is\nless expensive than Vandoren.\n•  Recommended for marching band use\n•  Will need to be numbered with a silver\nsharpie, paint-pen, or stickers\nYamaha Plastic Mouthpiece Cap\nMSRP $7.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  Plastic is absolutely preferred to metal\nto protect the tip of the mouthpiece and\nreed.\n•  Make sure that students playing on an\n“attic horn” have a mouthpiece cap.\nBG Saxophone Strap with Plastic\nSnap Hook\nMSRP $21.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  Comes with a built-in neck cushion, as\nwell as a sturdy plastic enclosed hook\n(like a keychain)\n•  The ring has to snap over the hook.\n•  Avoid any straps with open hooks.\nOne of the following can be chosen when assisting students with proper maintenance regarding\ncorks.\nSelmer Tuning Slide and Cork Grease\nMSRP $3.99 @ jwpepper.com\n•  The Selmer cork grease is a liquid and\nlasts much longer than the normal\nChapStick-style grease.\nCaution should be used when using this\nbecause it is very sticky.\n•  Must be stored in a plastic Ziploc bag as\nit may explode.\nIf it hits something in the case or if\nexposed to heat, it will damage other\nmaintenance kit items.\n•  To apply, squeeze a tiny bit of the\ngrease up and down onto the cork.\nThen, making a ring with the thumb and\nforefinger, work the cork grease into the\ncork to create enough friction to\nproperly lubricate the cork.\nWoodwind Cork Grease\nMSRP $2.25 @ wwbw.com\nit may explode or melt.\n•  Do not leave out at home unattended, as\nyounger children may actually use it as\nChapStick.\nGEM Swabs Silk Saxophone Swab\nMSRP $14.00 @ wwbw.com\n•  Do not use a cloth swab or a “shove-it”\n(currently called “Pad Saver”), which\nare often found with “attic horns.”\nNeither of these items will take\nsufficient moisture out of the body of\nthe instrument. The fibers also tend to\nget stuck.\n•  Very absorbent and features a tapered\ncut to limit the chance of getting stuck\nin the instrument\n•  The GEM swabs have a weight that is\nto be put through the bell and pulled\nthrough the body of the instrument. Be\ncareful that it does not go through the\nkey holes, as tension from pulling the\nswab will create leaks or may harm the\npads. Be sure to put the string in all the\nway so it will come out quicker.\n•  Do not yank or pull the swab from side-\nto-side. Pull the swab straight down and\nleave the neck strap on to prevent the\ninstrument from being dropped. While\ndoing this, one hand should always be\nholding the body of the instrument.\nPulling the swab too forcefully or\nquickly may result in the swab getting\nstuck or torn by the octave flu.\n•  Do not store the swab in the bell, as the\nmoisture will keep the pads wet.\n•  Hand wash the swab with dish soap or\nWoolite and warm water.\n•  The swab can be pulled through the\nneck, but be careful to take the same\nprecautions as pulling it through the\nbody.\n•  Be aware that a mouthpiece/neck swab\nmade of fleece/microfiber can be\npurchased at TMEA or wwbw.com for\n~$20.00\n8x10 Plexiglass\nBinswangerglass.com\n•  Prices vary depending on where mirrors\nare purchased.\n•  Mirrors purchased through Binswanger\ncan be purchased in bulk and cut to a\ndesired size.

Check to make sure.\n•  Place all saxophone cases on the floor in front of the student.\n•  Be sure the student understands where each part of the instrument belongs in\nthe case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make\nsure the student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure\nthe parts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse order they\nwere removed.\n•  All instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure\nexplicitly every time.\n•  Never leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up,\nbut this is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.\nCheck each opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to\nyour students.\n•  Cases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom\nsetup for each student’s case.  If using an ensemble room for the class, the\ncases may be opened in the hall.  The empty case will remain closed and\nlatched in the hall during class.\n•  When instruments are in their cases, do not allow students to sit on their cases\nAT ANY TIME because the low E-flat and C key guards will get bent.\nIdentifying Parts of the Saxophone and Removing It Safely From Its Case\n•  Once the case information is understood, place the case on the floor.  Never let\nthe student place the case in his lap.\nIdentify the neck strap.\n•  Open the case from its correct position.  Remember, most latches will lift up.\n•  When new instruments are delivered during the summer, be sure to remove the\nparts carefully from the plastic wrapping, and remove the corks (which are used\nto help pads keep their shape during shipping) between the rods.\n•  Corks on the neck of a new beginner instrument are usually really fat mainly\ndue to heat exposure during the delivery process.  The mouthpiece will not\neasily fit on the neck.  Only someone with experience should carefully sand the\ncork to the proper size.  Using very fine sand paper (400), take off a very small\namount and wrap it around and turn from side to side, being careful not to\nscrape too much as it could damage the laquer.  After this process, test it many\ntimes until you have the correct fit that can easily be controlled by a young\nstudent.\n•  For both new and used beginner instruments, it may be necessary to apply cork\ngrease lightly to the corks after instruments are delivered during the summer.\nMaking a ring with your thumb and forefinger, work the cork grease into each\ncork to create enough friction to properly lubricate the corks. Students will\neventually need to be taught to apply cork grease as well. Even if the student\nunderstands how little is needed, you still must watch them apply the cork\ngrease several times before you trust them to do the job alone.  Never let the\nstudent have his own tube of cork grease in the beginning of the learning\nprocess.  After he has proven his competence, he may have the tube.  If the\ncork looks dull, and the mouthpiece is difficult to fit with the neck, a small\namount of cork grease may be needed. Teach him to ask you first before\napplying. Once you know he has made the correct analysis, the student may\nmake his own decisions. Cork grease tubes or liquid grease can explode or melt\ninside the case if the respective lids are not completely closed. It is possible that\ndamage to the key mechanism will result if cork grease comes in contact with\nthe wood, metal or even other maintenance kit items.\n•  The body of the saxophone is one “unit” in the case and is easily placed into\nand taken from the case.\n•  The mouthpiece has a thin end and a fat end.  The top is curved, and the bottom\n(table) is flat.  The importance of these features will be explained later.\n•  The ligature is usually metal for the beginning instrument, having both a large\nend and a small end. The screws for the ligature will always appear on the right\nside of the mouthpiece as the student looks at the mouthpiece from the flat side.\nScrews for ligatures will never appear on the left side of the mouthpiece.\n•  The reed is basically the same shape as the mouthpiece.  It has a thin end and a\nfat end…..a flat side and a curved side.\n•  The reed/mouthpiece cap (protector) should be made of plastic (and sometimes\nmetal with attic horns) for the beginning instrument.  If metal protectors are\nused, be aware that they will most likely scratch the mouthpiece and perhaps\ndamage the tip of the reed.  Using a plastic protector will result in fewer broken\nreeds.  Students should always keep their mouthpiece in a mouthpiece cap\nwhen the instrument is not being played (including moving from a warm-up\nroom to a concert stage). A single chip in a mouthpiece can render it useless,\ncausing students to have to purchase a new one.\n•  Periodically have mouthpiece checks.  Check for chips on rails and on the tip.\nAlso check for chips on the inside of the tip.  Give written work to your\nstudents while you check each mouthpiece carefully.  A chipped mouthpiece\ncan be devastating to a beginning saxophone student’s embouchure\ndevelopment.\n•  No music, folders, flipfolders, rolled up music or unnecessary objects may be\nplaced in the case (especially on top of the instrument) at any time…..unless\nthey can fit inside the compartment meant for these items.\n•  Students should not be allowed to keep anything in the bell (i.e. rolled up\nmusic, neck straps, drill folders, reed boxes, water bottles, mouthpieces, etc.).\nPertaining specifically to baritone saxophone, some of these items could\nactually get stuck in the bell/instrument.\n•  Look at the case in relation to the parts of the saxophone.  Most cases are\nmolded to the shape of the particular parts.  Be specific when making this point\nto your students.  Take your time, and repeat the information many times.\nStorage of Mouthpiece and Neck (when allowed to be taken home by the students\nbut not in the actual saxophone case)\n•  Provide students a Ziploc bag…..or have students bring a sock or padded bag\nwith some sort of indentifying feature\n•  Ziploc bags/socks should be kept in a box in the front of the classroom, or\nstored safely in an office or filing cabinet.\n•  Bags/socks should only be taken out of the classroom by students after school.\n•  Bags/socks should only be brought into the classroom prior to the start of\nschool.\n•  Contents of bags/socks should never be kept in backpacks, bookbags, pencil\npouches, etc.\n•  Have some sort of accountability system in place when students leave their\nbags/socks overnight.  (cid:1)\n•  Be on the lookout for students coming into your classroom with bags/socks\n(and later saxophone cases) which were kept in their lockers or gym lockers.\nContents of Ziploc Bags/Socks\n•  Neck\n•  Mouthpiece\n•  Mouthpiece Cap\n•  Ligature\n•  Reed Guard\n•  Reeds\n•  Cork Grease\n•  Swab\nPARTS OF THE SAXOPHONE\nBis Bb/A#\nFront “tear-drop” key\nUpper Stack & Palm Keys\nLigature\nOctave Key\nSide Keys\nOn back\nE Palm Key\nSide C Key\nSide Bb/A#\nKey\nHigh F#/Gb\nFacilitator**\n“Fork” or\nside F#/Gb\n4\n5\n6\nEb/D# Palm\nD Palm Key\nF Palm\nLow Db/C# Key\nAb/G# Key\n“Spatula” Keys\nLow B Key\nLow Bb/A# Key\nLower Stack\nLow Eb/D# Key\nLow C Key\n**\nThe high F#/Gb facilitator is a\nfeature that is present on all\nprofessional and some intermediate\nsaxophone models.\nSAXOPHONE ASSEMBLY AND\nINSTRUMENT/BODY RATIO\n•  As you begin to teach the saxophone, give only the “set-up” (mouthpiece, neck and\nligature), as well as all related maintenance kit items (reeds, reed guard, mouthpiece\ncap, swab and cork grease), to the students in a plastic bag with the student’s name on\nit.  The body will remain in the case until further instruction is given.\n•  Students should be told that after sound production has been taught on the “set-up,”\nthey will be allowed to take home the body of the saxophone as well. To sell this\nconcept to the parents, explain the money factor.  It is almost as expensive to replace\none broken item as it is to buy an entire instrument.\nAssembly of the mouthpiece and neck “set-up”\n1.  Open the case, which should be on the floor in front of the student.\n2.  Put the reed in the mouth to moisten and smooth the top and bottom of it.\nMoistening the bottom of a reed helps create a seal, which will result in better\nresponse.\n3.  Take out the neck, avoiding the octave key. Do not put pressure on the octave\nkey; instead, grasp on the top or bottom of the neck.\n4.  Hold the octave key down on the neck with the palm of the hand.\n5.  Place the mouthpiece without the ligature on the neck using slight, twisting\nmotions.  Leave 1/4 to 1/3 of the cork showing on the neck for beginners.\nApplication of cork grease may b necessary at this time. When placed\ncorrectly, it is possible for the teacher to make a mark on the cork with a felt\ntip pen.  Never grab the tip of the mouthpiece; always grasp around the\nmiddle.\n6.  Place the large end of the ligature over the mouthpiece carefully.  Make sure\nthe screws are on the right--in the back--as you look at them from the table of\nthe mouthpiece.  Bonade ligatures have two screws……BG ligatures have one\nscrew.  If using Rovner ligatures, the leather is in the front and there is one\nscrew in the back.\n7.  Lift the ligature slightly with the thumb and forefinger of a chosen hand, and\ncarefully slide the reed onto the table of the mouthpiece.  The reed is placed\nfat to fat, flat to flat and thin to thin.\n8.  Line the sides of the reed up with the rails.\n9.  Look for a thin black line/sliver at the tip of the mouthpiece.\n10. The ligature should be slightly below the line on the bottom of most quality\nmouthpieces.  Pertaining to C* mouthpieces, the ligature should line up with\nthe top line closest to the tip of the mouthpiece…….and the top line of the\nmouthpiece lines up with the line on the middle of the reed.\n11. For ligatures with two screws:  tighten the lower screw snuggly, and the top\nscrew to its first point of resistance.  For ligatures with one screw:  tighten the\nscrew to its first point of resistance.  Generally speaking, ligatures that are\nplaced too low result in control issues; ligatures that are placed too high\nprohibit reed vibration.\nAssembly of the body of the saxophone (assuming that the assembly of the\nmouthpiece and neck set-up is already completed and is kept in a safe place)\n1.  Take out the neck strap and put it on.  Students with hoodies need to make\nsure the neck strap is placed on the skin of their neck.  For neck straps\nwith visible logos (i.e. Protec), the logo should be facing up.\n2.  Take the body out and clip it onto the neck strap.  Never trust that the neck\nstrap will secure the saxophone, because the hooks can easily snap.  Grab\nthe body with the right hand and support the back of the saxophone with\nthe left hand.  Discourage students from grabbing the bell as opposed to\nthe body, because the bell could become unaligned with time.  DO NOT\nLET THE SAXOPHONE HANG FROM THE NECK STRAP.\n3.  Remove the plug from the saxophone.  The plug protects the octave key\nmechanism, which pushes the neck to open the tone holes.  This\nmechanism is very expensive to replace.  All saxophones must have a\nplug.  Check to make sure all students have a plug; students playing used\nor attic horns may not have one.\n4.  Loosen the neck screw, which will be on the right on all beginner\ninstruments. Students should turn the screw towards them.\n5.  Twist and push the neck and mouthpiece set-up (already assembled) onto\nthe body of the saxophone, avoiding the palm keys.  Line up the brace--on\nthe bottom of the neck--to the top of the octave key rod. More simply put,\nthe point that sticks out should be exactly in line with the brace on the\nbottom of the neck.\n6.  Turn the screw that supports the neck to the first point of resistance.  Too\nmuch pressure during this process may result in a stripped screw.\n• When the alto and tenor saxophones have to be set down on the chair or floor for any\nreason (leaving class, breathing exercises where students are standing, etc.), students\nshould first turn the neck slightly to their left. It is furthermore important that the rods\nare facing down with the low C key guard on the edge of the chair.  This is to prevent\nthe D palm key from being damaged.  However, regarding the baritone saxophone:\nthis instrument can be put down with the rods up; because the instrument rests on the\ncrook, the keys are higher and will therefore result in little if any chance of damage.\n• When students have to leave their chair during a class, the mouthpiece and neck needs\nto be removed and placed on the chair; the body of the instrument can then be placed\nunderneath the chair in the above-stated manner.\nInstrument Disassembly\n1.  Open the case, which should again be placed on the floor in front of the\n2.  Loosen the neck screw and put the neck and mouthpiece in a safe place.\nBe sure the octave key is depressed with the palm of the hand as the neck\nis removed.\n3.  Swab the body of the instrument.  Do not yank or pull the swab from\nside-to-side.  Using light tugs, pull the swab straight down from the top\nand out through the bell.  Leave the neck strap on to prevent the\ninstrument from being dropped. While doing this, one hand should\nalways be holding the body of the instrument.\n4.  Replace the plug in the body and tighten the screw.\n5.  Replace the body in the case.  Grab the body with the right hand and\nsupport the back of the saxophone with the left hand.\n6.  Pick up the neck and mouthpiece.  Loosen the ligature screw(s). Do not\nlet the students loosen the screw(s) so much that the screws fall out!\n7.  Remove the reed by lifting the ligature with the thumb and forefinger,\nbeing careful not to have any contact with the tip of the reed.  “Vacuum”\nthe reed through the lips……blot the reed on the pants/shorts if\nnecessary……and put in the reed guard.\n8.  Remove the ligature from the mouthpiece.\n9.  Remove the mouthpiece from the neck by using slight, twisting motions.\n10. Swab the neck once the mouthpiece has been removed.  The swab can be\npulled through the neck, but be aware that the neck has a little protrusion\n(octave flu) on which the swab can tear.\n11. Replace the neck in the case.\n12. The ligature must be left on the mouthpiece with a dry reed and a plastic\nprotector. Consider using an old or unused DRY reed to be placed on the\nmouthpiece at the end of each playing session, whether it is at school or\nat home.  Always leave the ligature on the mouthpiece with this “dry\nreed,” which is replacing the “class reed.”  This will prevent damage and\nallow the ligature to form and bond more correctly with the mouthpiece.\nA “USED/WET” REED WILL RESULT IN MOLD OR MILDEW\nFORMING ON THE REED, IN THE MOUTHPIECE AND THE\nCASE.\n13. Replace the mouthpiece in the case.\n14. Students should be given CLASS TIME to clean out their instrument,\nand store their reed and instrument properly in the case.\n15. SEND SEGMENTS OF THIS INFORMATION HOME TO\nPARENTS.  CHOOSE THE INFORMATION YOU THINK\nWOULD BE HELPFUL FOR HOME PRACTICE AND\nINSTRUMENT CARE.\nInstrument/Body Ratio\n•  All neck strap adjustments require the use of both hands (when body of saxophone is\nnot yet being used). When students have learned how to hold the saxophone, it can be\nlaid on their lap or in the case while they continue learning how to adjust their neck\nstrap.\n• Familiarize the student with the instrument/body ratio by using the fully assembled\nsaxophone but without the reed.  Be sure the saxophone is adjusted to the student by\nadjusting instrument placement and neck strap length.\n• In the beginning, the “baby position” for saxophone can be achieved by students\ngrasping the bell with their right hand and grasping gently around the top of the body.\n• There are three balance points when holding the saxophone:\n1.  both thumbs\n2.  side of the leg\n3.  neck strap\n• Make sure that the body is in its natural playing posture when finding these balance\npositions.  The student should feel comfortable at all times.  The right arm should\nfollow the line of the upper body.  It should never be placed back behind the chest\ncavity.  When these balance points are focused on at one time, the posture will look\nvery natural.\n• When the right arm incorrectly falls behind the chest cavity, students can:\n1.  loosen their neck strap\n2.  turn the neck\n3.  torque the mouthpiece\n• Correct playing position will be realized when all of the aforementioned details from\nthis handout are understood.  The weight of the saxophone is difficult to balance\nwithout the fulcrum created by the combination of the three balance points.\n• Watch for students to rest the bottom of the bell on either their knee or on the chair\nitself while playing (cid:1).\nSAXOPHONE HAND POSITION\nRIGHT HAND POSITION\n1.  Always place the right hand first. The left hand should grasp in a non-delicate\narea.\n2.  The second knuckle of the thumb should be placed under the right edge of the\nthumb rest.\n3.  Fingers should be placed on the pearls. The fleshy part will touch the pearls.\n4.  The little finger should rest on the roller keys. “Home position” will be the E-\nflat key, which is the higher of the two keys.\n5.  Fingers should remain on the pearls and be curved and round, and not ever go\npast the pearls (resulting in flat fingers).  Double-jointed students can extend\ntheir fingers “out”/past the pearls more as opposed to keeping them close to\nthe pearls.\n6.  The wrist must stay in line with the rest of the forearm. The wrist should not\ncollapse into the side keys.\n7.  Practice moving the fingers up and down from the big knuckles. Do not let the\nother two knuckles move.  The finger pads should stay on the pearls at all\ntimes. In the beginning the little finger can move up and down also.\n8.  Do not include side keys in the initial hand position information. If asked, tell\nthem once the hands can move correctly using the pearls, they will be allowed\nto learn to use the keys on the side.\nLEFT HAND POSITION\n** While teaching left hand position, the right hand can gently grasp the bell.\n1.  The left thumb rests on the back thumb rest and never leaves.  The second\nknuckle should basically be in the middle of the thumb rest.\n2.  Place the index finger on the first pearl.  The Yamaha YAS-23 and other\nbrands feature an extra pearl, or “teardrop key” which will need to be skipped.\n3.  Skip the small pearl (bis key).\n4.  Place the middle and ring finger on the next two pearls.  The finger pads\nshould stay on the pearls at all times.\n5.  The pinky should rest on the “home key,” which is the G#/Ab key.  The pinky\nshould not be straight; it needs to be curved. Watch for pinkies that disappear\neither under the saxophone or under the pinky keys.\n6.  Fingers should remain on the pearls and be curved and round, and not ever go\npast the pearls (resulting in flat fingers). As stated earlier, double-jointed\nstudents can extend their fingers “out”/past the pearls more as opposed to\nkeeping them close to the pearls.\n7.  Keep the hand in an adjusted “flat-C” position and the wrist slightly up.  The\nwrist must stay in line with the rest of the forearm.\n8.  Always feel the palm of the hands to check for the softness of the fingers.\nThere are more bones in this area of the hand than any other part of the body.\nIf the palm is soft, all other parts of the hand will be as naturally soft as is\npossible.  The little fingers should have comfortable “home keys” they touch\nall of the time in the beginning stages.\nFINGER EXERCISES\n1.  All fingers in each hand move together.  Call out the hand you wish to move.\nThe students move all of the fingers in that hand down never leaving the\npearls.  The right hand thumb obviously does not ever move when the teacher\nasks for “RIGHT”, but the left hand thumb can move with the fingers of the\nleft hand when the teacher asks for “LEFT”.\n2.  Next, we move the fingers one at a time beginning with the left hand.  The\nthumb and first finger are already down in this exercise, and each additional\nfinger in both hands will be numbered two through six from top of the body to\nthe bottom of the body. The fingers will move down or up depending on their\nstarting position, as the number is called by the teacher.  We do not use the\nlittle fingers when we first begin this exercise.\n3.  Watch the fingers to see that they move smoothly in constant contact with the\npearls, in natural position and move up and down from the big knuckle only.\nThe student should understand that the movement is aided by the soft tissue of\nthe palm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand.\n4.  Constantly watch and monitor students who have “fly-away-fingers”… as\nwell as unused fingers pressing into “used” fingers. To avoid “fly-away-\nfingers”, use double-sided tape, which is safe to put on the pearls.\n5.  Next, we move the fingers in combinations: one, two….one, two\nthree…….one, two, three, four……one, two, three, four, five…..one, two,\nthree, four, five, six………six, five, four, three, two, one……five, four, three,\ntwo, one…….four, three, two, one……three, two, one………two, one……\nLater the development of moving the first and second finger separately is\nadded.\n6.  Using these exercises, the fingers move in all of the ways they move to play\nthe saxophone: all together, one at a time, and in combinations.  This exercise\nwill be demonstrated.\n7.  Refer to your supplemental page regarding exercises to perfect the usage of\nthe roller keys and palm keys.  These exercises must not be introduced too\nearly in the development of a student’s hand position.\nREED MANUFACTURERS AND REED STRENGTH\nReed Manufacturers:\nVandoren (blue box)\n•  Most widely used and recommended for any\nlevel of playing\n•  Available in strengths 1 through 5\n•  Clarinet – MSRP $41.99 @ wwbw.com\nAlto saxophone – MSRP $53.99\nVandoren V-12 (silver box)\n•  For more advanced players\n•  More consistent reed to reed, but do not last\nas long  as blue box reeds (has to do with\nhow they are cut)\n•  More expensive than blue box reeds\n•  Better “out of the box” than blue box reeds\n•  Slightly harder than blue box reeds\n•  Clarinet – MSRP $55.99 @ wwbw.com\nAlto saxophone – MSRP $61.99\nVandoren 56 (made for clarinet only)\n•  Cut from thicker cane\n•  MSRP $55.99 @ wwbw.com\nMitchell Lurie (made for clarinet only)\n•  For lower socio-economic areas, these reeds\nare an acceptable brand.\n•  A cheaper substitute for Vandoren blue box\nreeds\n•  MSRP $32.75 @ wwbw.com\nRico Reeds\n•  Less expensive, but not the best\nquality\n•  Acceptable for beginners in a\nlower socio-economic area, but not\nrecommended for long term use\n•  Clarinet – MSRP $29.50\nAlto saxophone –MSRP $42.00\nD’Addario Reserve\nClarinet Reserve – blue/white box\nClarinet Reserve Classic – purple/white\nbox\nAlto saxophone Reserve – green/white box\n•  Softer reeds which produce a stuffier\n•  Considered perfect “out of the box”,\nbut do not last a long time\n•  Clarinet – MSRP $58.75\nAlto saxophone – MSRP $54.75\nGonzalez (made for saxophone only)\n•  Cane comes from Argentina.\n•  More consistent than Vandoren\nreeds, but will not sound as good\n•  Available in ¼ strengths\nLa Voz (recommended for saxophone only)\n•  Acceptable for beginners in a lower socio-\neconomic area, but not  recommended for long\nterm use\n•  Less expensive option\n•  MSRP $45.25 @ wwbw.com\n•  Brands to avoid\no  Legere\no  Rico Royal\no  Riyin\no  Rigotti\no  Marca\no  La Voz – Acceptable for beginners in lower socio-economic areas\no  Alexander\no  any flavored reeds\no  any plastic reeds\n•  Specifically for saxophone, you are recommended to avoid:\no  Vandoren Java (green box) or Vandoren ZZ (black box), as these are file-\ncut Java reeds\no  Vandoren V16 (green box), which are reeds used for jazz playing\no  Vandoren “hand select” reeds (black box); these reeds are over $40 a box!\nIn handouts given out at the beginning of the year, inform parents about purchasing\nreeds.  Try to arrange it so students only buy reeds from the school.  Be sure the\nparents know that by purchasing the reeds from the school, they will receive a\n“___ percent” discount.  Make arrangements with your road man to facilitate this\nprocess.\nReed Strength\n•  Reeds generally come in half strength. Strengths that are offered vary by\nmanufacturer.\no  Strength is relative to the thickness of the reed. For example, a 2½ reed is\nthinner than a 3.\no  Larger strength reeds require more air; therefore, it is vital that beginners start\non a 2 or 2½, because they are still learning how to use their air properly. It is\nimportant to know that some reed manufacturers produce 1 and 1½ strength\nreeds!!!!! NOW….. considering the fact that professionals generally play\nbetween 3½ to 5 strength reeds, it would naturally make sense that MS/JH\nstudents not be playing on these stronger reeds!!!!!!!!\no  Reed strength is also dependent on the climate and player’s preference.\no  REFRAIN FROM PRESENTING THE “BADGE OF HONOR”\nPHILOSOPHY:\nFor example, if your students are playing on 2½ strength reeds in their\nbeginner class, they should not be told that they will advance to a 3 strength\nreed their second year…to a 3½ strength reed their third year…etc. You must\ncarefully base your decision to advance a student’s reed strength on the\nfollowing characteristics:\n1.  How students look—do their faces look natural when they are playing?\n2.  How students use their air—if they are not using air correctly, they will\nnot have success on any reed strength.\n3.  How students sound—is their sound stuffy?  Do you hear more air than\ntonal resonance in their sound?\nIf a clinician or mentor, after hearing your students, suggests a softer\nreed strength, students should be trained to accept this professional\nadvice. It is your job (as well as experienced private teachers if\napplicable) to closely monitor each individual student, as they will be\nplaying and developing at different levels. With that said, students\nshould move up a reed strength when the teachers feel it is time.\n•  It is perfectly acceptable for first/second year students to remain\non 2 or 2 ½ strength reeds for a long period of time. Second and\nthird year players may progress to 3 strength reeds as time goes by.\n•  Young band directors are encouraged to consult with an experienced\nprivate lesson teacher or band director/colleague when trying to make\ndecisions regarding appropriate times to advance reed strengths for\nstudents.\nReed Strengths Specifics Regarding Saxophone\n•  Most advanced alto saxophone players should remain on Vandoren 3s for classical\nsaxophone playing throughout the duration of their public school experience.\n•  MS/JH tenor and baritone saxophone players should begin on Vandoren 2 ½s.\n•  HS tenor saxophone players may progress to Vandoren 3s…maybe 3 ½s.\n•  HS baritone saxophone players may progress to Vandoren 3s.\nReed Qualities\n•  All reeds are hand-made. Every reed will sound different and will slightly vary in\nthickness as well as quality. The strength can be the same, but the individual cut will\nhave effects on the sound quality. Hard and soft does not refer to the actual reed\nstrength, but instead the individual cut of the reed. There are two distinct categories:\no  Hard\n(cid:1)  Thicker (more wood)\n(cid:1)  Requires more air\n(cid:1)  Requires a firmer embouchure\n(cid:1)  Can potentially allow students to bite more\n(cid:1)  Generally sounds airy/fuzzy, brittle, unclear, and is sharper in pitch\n(cid:1)  Playing with a hard reed can create tension in the face/embouchure, as\nwell as the jaw and neck.\no  Soft\n(cid:1)  Thinner (less wood)\n(cid:1)  The embouchure does not have to be as firm to produce a good sound.\n(cid:1)  Does not allow you to bite as much\n(cid:1)  The sound will be soft, honky, less resonant, unfocused, and\nsometimes spread.\n(cid:1)  Playing softly will be easier, but louder dynamics will have a bright\nsound. Louder dynamics will also be flat in pitch.\no  Try to find a medium “in between” reed that produces the best, desirable\nsound for each individual student.\nReed Life Cycle\n•  The cane is hand cut in the south of France in Var. Reeds are then individually\npackaged and shipped.\n•  Breaking in a reed (explained in Soaking, Breaking In and Adjusting Reeds\nhandout).\n•  Reeds that are rotated can last for 2-4 weeks depending on how much they are played\non.\no  The more a reed is played on, the softer it gets.\no  As reeds get older, they lose resonance.\no  If a reed is used too long in one sitting, the moisture that has been collecting\nin the pores of the reed will cause mold to build up.\n•  Reeds that are too thin and/or worn down from excessive use will become\nunacceptable in terms of quality and sound.\no  The response will be slow.\no  Vibrations will be slow.\no  The reed becomes thin and will produce an undesirable, spread sound.\no  Students will start to squeak on starts because the reed is harder to control.\no  MOLD will become visible.\no  These are all signs that a reed needs to be replaced.\nFinding a Good Reed\n•  Just because a reed is new, it does not mean that it will sound good.\n•  You can tell a good reed from a bad reed by sight.\no  Good reeds are yellow or crème colored on the heart.\no  Good reeds look “clean.”\no  Bad reeds have visible veins.\no  Bad reeds have a tip that is too transparent (this can be seen if a reed is held\nup to a light).\n•  You—as the teacher—reserve the right to tell a student that a reed can no longer be\nplayed.  Be professional and sensitive when telling a student a reed is bad and needs\nto be thrown away.  Parents should be made aware of this information before\ntheir child is officially recruited to play a single reed instrument.\n•  It is also important for parents to understand that as their child becomes more\nadvanced/experienced, their reeds can last longer…..AS LONG AS THE\nSTUDENTS ARE FOLLOWING ALL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN DURING\nCLASS!!  As this process evolves over time, reeds may not need to be purchased\nas often as they were when the students were first and second year players!\n•  You are encouraged to create a “Reed Graveyard” for students to deposit reeds that\nneed to be disposed of. This can be labeled and decorated as a motivating factor for\nstudents to want to deposit reeds… as opposed to leaving them on music stands, the\nfloor, or in their cases. (cid:2)\n•  To monitor quality of reeds, be sure to hear students play individually EVERY\nDAY…. regardless of their experience and/or playing ability.\nReed Guards and Reed Rotation\n•  Students must have reed guards with four completely broken in reeds.\n•  Students must be taught from the beginning to rotate each of their four reeds, which\nshould always be in their reed guard.\n•  Students should be trained to play on a DIFFERENT, BROKEN IN REED during\nevery class period/rehearsal or performance opportunity.  For example, a student\nshould not play on a reed more than one performance opportunity on any given day\n(exceptions—warm-ups and/or rehearsals prior to major individual or group\nauditions/performances).\n•  Reeds with chips, mold, etc., should never be played on—or even kept—in the reed\nguard. In addition, reeds that are too thin—or do not sound good for whatever\nreason—should never be kept in the reed guard.\n•  Reed guard checks should be daily in beginning classes at first. Daily grades should\nbe given when having a reed guard check. Each of the four reeds should be 25%.\n•  Reed guard checks can be periodic in MS/JH and HS ensembles as often as you feel\nnecessary.  Grades can be given as motivation.\n•  Reed guards should be accessible during daily rehearsals, as well as any off campus\nrehearsal, performance, contest, festival, etc. Reed guard accessibility pertains to\nthem being outside of their cases, not inside.\nSOAKING, BREAKING IN AND ADJUSTING REEDS\nSoaking Reeds\n•  Soak/break in the very first reed…. for several minutes…. together in class while\nthe teacher is closely monitoring the students.  Following this process, the teacher\nshould assign three additional reeds to be broken in for homework.  With that said,\nreed guards should be going home with students each and every day—whether or not\nthe entire instrument is going home.\n1.  Remove the reed from the plastic reed holder.  The left hand should hold the plastic\nreed holder, with the thumb on the reed guard logo.  The right hand thumb and index\nfinger should carefully slide the reed out of the plastic reed holder, with the tip\ncoming out first.\n2.  Hold the reed with the thumb on the words and the index finger on the back.\n3.  Lay the reed on the tongue.  Talk to students about the unusual taste of the reed, and\nassure them that with time, this process will become second nature.\n4.  Draw the tongue in.  The teeth should not have any contact with the reed.\n5.  Place the reed in the mouth to moisten and smooth the top and bottom of it.\nMoistening the bottom of a reed helps create a seal around the mouthpiece, which\nwill result in better response.\n6.  Flatten the tip of the reed by putting the side with words on the table (flat part of the\nmouthpiece).  Place the thumb on the on the tip of the reed, (which is now on the\ntable) and wiggle the reed back and forth to get any warps out.  This helps with over-\nall reed vibration.\n7.  Vacuum reeds at the end of class (have students suck air through the mouthpiece to\neliminate water on the reed).\n8.  At the end of each class period/practice session, suck the air through the mouthpiece\nto eliminate water on the reed.  Reeds can now be “vacuumed” by carefully removing\nthe reed through the lips.  Reeds can furthermore be blotted on shorts/jeans/etc.  This\nwill eliminate excessive saliva to remain on the reed…which will eventually mold if\nnot vacuumed.  (cid:1)\n9.  With the plastic reed holder held in the same manner as discussed in #1, carefully\nslide the butt of the reed into the reed guard first, so that the tip is not destroyed.\nBreaking in Reeds\n•  There are two specific reasons why breaking in reeds is important:\n1.  so reeds last longer\n2.  so students will always have reeds on hand\n•  There is a process involved to properly and effectively break in a reed:\no  Break in two to four reeds at a time.  Most reed guards have four slots.  Break\nin two reeds at a time to avoid all four reeds dying at the same time.\no  Students should soak reeds as described in #5 in the previous section.  Reeds\nshould not be soaked for too long; otherwise, they will become waterlogged.\no  Students should play on each new reed for no longer than five minutes.  If the\ntip becomes transparent, then the student should switch reeds.  The reed\nshould not become waterlogged, and it should not be used when playing in\nextreme registers.\no  After following this procedure for three days, students can start playing on the\nreeds for a longer period of time.  As this takes place, students and teachers\ncan start to judge the sound quality of the reed and make any necessary\nadjustments.\nTricks for Adjusting Poor Quality Reeds\n•  Every reed is different and will sound different.\n•  Students should learn to be picky about the sound quality of reeds.\n•  When dealing with a reed that is too soft:\no  Move the reed up on the mouthpiece slightly.  This is only a temporary “quick\nfix” if there are no other reeds available.  The ligature can also be raised\nslightly on the reed/mouthpiece.  Do not raise the ligature above the bark\n(polished bottom part) of the reed.\no  Clip the reed using a reed clipper.  This cuts off part of the tip of the reed.\nOnly an experienced lesson teacher or a very knowledgeable band director\nshould be clipping reeds.\no  Set the reed aside and let it sit/age.  Time and weather will change the quality\nof a reed.\no  Colder climates make certain reeds sound thinner.  Students may need to wait\nfor warmer weather before coming back to that particular reed.\nWhen dealing with a reed that is too hard:\no  For mildly hard reeds, “polish” the reed on a sheet of paper. Place the flat part\nof a reed (not the side with bark) on the paper and press/rub in circles with 2\nor 3 fingers. This must be done on a flat surface.\no  For mildly hard reeds, the reed can be lowered slightly on the mouthpiece so\nthat the thinner part of the reed is being played. Be aware, however, that this is\nonly a quick fix. The ligature can also be moved slightly lower on the\nreed/mouthpiece, if necessary.\no  For slightly harder reeds, sand down the flat part of the reed with 600 grit sand\npaper (or finer). The reed must then be polished.\no  For very hard reeds:\n(cid:2)  Determine which side of the reed is harder.\n(cid:2)  Play on the left and right side to see which side is more difficult to\nproduce a sound on.\n(cid:2)  Use a reed knife and scrape off wood from both sides surrounding the\nheart. Do not scrape off the tip or the heart of the reed. Remove\nmore cane from the thicker side.  Be very careful not to scrape off too\nmuch.\no  Again, only an experienced lesson teacher or a very knowledgeable band\ndirector should be scraping reeds.\no  Try pushing on the tip of the reed with the thumb while it is on the\nmouthpiece. Close the tip opening and then press a little more 2-3 times.\nCheck to see if the reed is softer.\no  Ask an older/more experienced private lesson teachers for even more tricks\nthat may be out there!\no  Sometimes a student is simply dealing with a bad reed………and throwing it\naway is easier than the frustration it will cause………let alone the many\nattempts to fix/adjust the reed. (cid:1)\nSAXOPHONE EMBOUCHURE\n•  Students must be able to use air correctly before beginning to learn the\nsaxophone embouchure.\n•  Use the neck and mouthpiece for better control.\n•  The  teacher  should  place  the  neck  and  mouthpiece  in  the  beginning.    Place  the\nbottom lip first, then the upper teeth and top lip.\n•  The student needs to remember how it feels and sounds.\n•  Once the teacher has demonstrated how it feels and sounds, the\nstudent can hold the neck and mouthpiece in place and watch\nhis  face  in  a  mirror  to  make  sure  nothing  moves  or  looks  unnatural.    Then,  the\nstudent remembers how it looks, feels and sounds.\nIt  is  best  to  hold  the  neck  and  mouthpiece  with  two  fingers  and  a  thumb  in  a\nbalanced  manner.    The  fingers  should  have  absolutely  no  contact  with  the\nmouthpiece or ligature.\n•  The mouthpiece is held by the teeth, not the lips.\n•  The upper teeth rest on the mouthpiece material (patch).\n•  The lower teeth feel the reed through the lower lip that covers them.\n•  The lower lip covers the lower teeth like a fitted sheet covers a mattress.\n•  The back teeth are naturally apart.\n•  The  tongue  is  in  the  “ah”  or  “ew”  position…..and  not  pulled  back.    For  tenor\nsaxophone,  the  tongue  is  in  the  “ah”  position,  and  “oh”  for  the  baritone\nsaxophone.\n•  Using the index finger, gently push the lower lip toward, but not rolled\nover the lower teeth.  Lick the part that goes over.  That is the correct amount.\n•  The  saxophone  embouchure  is  created  with  a  natural  overbite  position  with  a\nslight valley in the chin.\n•  The  corners  are  toward  the  mouthpiece.    Ultimately,  the  corners  will  be  toward\nthe mouthpiece and down.\n•  There should be no wrinkles in the lower lip and red flesh must be seen\non either side of the mouthpiece.\n•  The lower lip that is not under the reed stays in front of the teeth.\n•  Never tell students to pull their lips over their teeth.  Pulling and stretching makes\nlips thicker.\n•  The upper lip rests on top of the mouthpiece in front of the upper teeth.\n•  The upper lip should be soft and pliable, and follow the shape/contour of the\nmouthpiece.\n•  Both the top and bottom lip should always feel soft and natural.\n•  There should be no lines or dimples that do not appear in the natural face.  The\nface essentially should be “zombie”-like.\n•  The air is directed through an imaginary dot, which is at the center of the\nmouthpiece and reed.\n•  Enough mouthpiece must be past the lips into the chamber of the mouth to allow\nthe reed to freely vibrate.  Usually less than half the mouthpiece is sufficient.\n•  There must be a resonant second space treble clef concert A-flat sounded.\nIf the sound is stuffy, the student may be holding the mouthpiece with the lips.\nIf the sound is strident and brittle, the student may have too much mouthpiece\nin his mouth or may be using too much unfocused air.\n•  Be sure the student can control the air well enough to find the correct balance of\nair and resistance to create the sound you want on the neck and mouthpiece.\n•  Remember that the mouth can be too open; the teeth can be out of position; the\nlips can be too loose and puffy or can grip; the tongue can be too far back in the\nmouth; the student can be lifting too little.  All of these will result in a sound you\nwill not wish to create.\n•  Keep making subtle adjustments to the angle, amount of mouthpiece taken, etc.\nJust a slight movement can really improve the resonance of the vibration.\n•  Keep the body and face calm and still while learning this embouchure.\n•  The embouchure is a constant work in progress.  Special attention should be given\nto the contact of the upper teeth with the mouthpiece material.  The teacher can\nattempt to move the mouthpiece out of position to make the student aware that\nsomething is incorrect.\nIt is easier to make something firmer than to get rid of unnecessary tightness.\nIf the sound is not clear, instant and resonant on the neck and mouthpiece, the\nsound on the saxophone will not be resonant and beautiful.\n•  When the neck and mouthpiece is placed on the body of the saxophone, the first\nattempt at sound production should be made with the teacher’s assistance.\nIf a student plays above pitch, they may be biting down on their mouthpiece or the\nmouthpiece may be too far in the mouth.  If a student is below pitch, their air may\nbe too slow, their embouchure may be too loose, or their mouthpiece may be out\ntoo far.\nQualities of Uncharacteristic Sounds and Their Causes\n•  Grainy sound:  tension in the mouth~~or “waterlogged” reed\n•  Buzzy sound:  reed is too hard~~or too much tension from the bottom lip\n•  Thin  sound:    reed  is  too  thin/soft~~or  not  enough  mouthpiece~~or  insufficient\namount of air\n•  Unfocused  sound:    too  much  mouthpiece~~or  uncontrolled  air~~or  too  soft  of  a\nreed\n•  No sound:  lower teeth not in contact with the bottom lip~~or reed too hard\n•  Flat sound:  corners not firm~~or cheeks uncontrolled (puffing) ~~or teeth not on\nthe mouthpiece\nMAKING THE FIRST SAXOPHONE MOUTHPIECE\nAND NECK SOUND\nInitial sound production cannot be introduced until correct posture and breathing\nhas been successfully taught.  Include these two essential components as “part” of\nthe first sound attempt(s).\n•  Relax position and ready position should already be taught and drilled prior to\nsound production.  As sound production is occurring, playing position must be\nincorporated.  Students need to understand that ready position means they are\nready to play.  Playing position means that they are set (physically) to play.\nStudents should not be allowed to sit in relax position during class, except maybe\nduring announcements, paperwork or things not pertaining to playing.  If one\nword instructions are preferred, then use “ready” and “set.”\n•  Try to get every student to make a sound on the first day of sound production.  If\nyou will not be able to accomplish this, make a disclaimer before you start.  The\nstudents who do not end up getting to make their first sound—on the first day—\nwill be the first students you will start with on the second day!  Students should\nnot be surprised or frustrated if you do not get to them on this first day.\n•  On day one of sound production, make another disclaimer if you suspect that you\nwill not get far enough along to allow any of the students to take home their “set-\nup”.\n•  At the end of each class, you must make the decision to allow just those who you\nassisted to take home their set-up…….or not allow set-ups to go home until\neveryone has made sounds with your assistance (day one, day two, etc.).\n•  Once you allow and require set-ups to go home on a daily basis, students should\nbe recording their practice time on whatever form of practice card you are using.\nBe realistic when designating ____ minutes to be spent on their set-up sounds\nduring their home practice.\nIt is not necessary to have students make sounds on just the mouthpiece (without\nthe neck).  It will be much easier for you……and eventually less awkward for the\nstudents…….to hold the mouthpiece and neck.  If you choose to start on just the\nmouthpiece, then you are encouraged to add the neck very soon.\n•  Do not use a metronome when assisting students to make their first sounds.  A\nmetronome should not be added until the class is at the point of making group\nsounds.\n•  Remind students that lipstick, Chapstick, etc. cannot be worn during class.\nStudents need to understand that their reeds will not last long, and they will begin\nto see mold.  (cid:1)\n•  When working one-on-one with students in your beginning class, it is important\nthat the students are ready as soon as the teacher reaches them.  While other\nstudents are waiting, they must either be paying attention to what you are\ndoing…..or working on a music theory worksheet, etc.\n•  While going around the room, students should not be allowed to make sounds on\ntheir set-up—even if they have already been assisted.  They should also not be\nallowed to improperly hold their set-up (i.e. putting a finger in the bottom of their\nneck…..twirling or playing with the set-up in general……etc.)\n•  The instructor must place all mouthpiece and neck for students.  This may\ncontinue for 2-5 days (if not longer), depending on the size and overall ability\nlevel of your class.\n•  You should be directly in front of each individual student when assisting them,\nand not to the side. It would be most effective if students were standing and\n“finding their horizon.”  Music stands should be elevated to the proper height,\nand a mirror should be properly positioned on each stand.  You will learn to\nmaneuver around each student’s equipment, etc.  At this point, all cases should be\ndirectly under or to the side of their chairs.\n•  As you are working with each student, your goal is to assist each student in\nmaking a quality sound on or in the vicinity of the correct pitch (second space A-\nflat).  Do not get on to students who do not produce the exact pitch—especially if\nthey are using brands of mouthpieces and ligatures that may be inferior and/or not\non your recommended list.  When listening to each student, listen for:\no  quality of sound\no  consistency of sound\no  pitch\n•  Unless the saxophone is your primary instrument, you should not be modeling\nsounds on the set-up.  As you assist each student, you will eventually find a “star\nstudent” who will become the model for future reference.  Be sure to periodically\nuse a keyboard or a metronome—with pitches—so as not to “lose sight” of the\ncorrect pitch (regardless of whether or not a model is used).\n•  Be aware of fragile and/or teary-eyed students. Move on to the next student in the\ninterest of time, but make an effort to return to these students by the end of class.\nDo not let a student leave class feeling unsuccessful.  If possible, offer a pass for\nstruggling students to come in at lunch or before/after school.\n•  The set-up always goes to the student; not the student to the set-up.\n•  Before bringing the set-up to the student, check for:\nligatures that have been placed correctly\nligature screws that are too tight\no\no  proper mouthpiece angles\no  proper alignment of the reed\no  condition of reeds\n•  Train students not to move their faces or body when you are placing the set-up. It\nmay take certain students multiple tries, and if they move after each attempt, they\n(and you!) basically have to start over each time.\n•  When students breathe, do not allow their corners to pull back at all.\nFurthermore, upper lips should not be coming off the plastic of the tops of the\nmouthpieces.  Students should breathe only through their corners, keeping their\nupper lips on the tops of the mouthpieces.\n•  With the set-up, students should progress through the following steps:\no  air (The sound starts and ends with air, making students aware of how\nthey can control their air.  This also helps students avoid undue tightness\nin the embouchure.)\no  air~vibration~air (The air “turns into” a vibration and returns to air.)\no  air~vibration\no  vibration (ultimate “final” sound)\n•  No articulation syllable should be used when making set-up sounds.  The ultimate\ngoal is for students to start their sounds with air.  An articulation syllable will be\nassigned after all students are making characteristic and consistent sounds on the\nset-up, as well as the fully-assembled saxophone.\n•  Students need to direct their air through an imaginary dot, which is at the center of\ntheir mouthpiece and reed, in order to achieve the desired sound.\n•  Make sure the students understand that “a sound” may not happen the very first\ntime. This is a trial and error process and may take multiple tries.\n•  Once the set-up has been placed correctly and students are making the sound you\nwant, they need to remember:\no  how it looks (by looking in the mirror)\no  how it feels\nAllow and instruct them to take the set-up from your hand without moving their\nbody and embouchure.  Have them try to reproduce the sound on their own.  Be\nprepared to further assist them if necessary.  When the sound is correct, students\nneed to remember how it sounds.\n•  Train students to freeze their body, face and embouchure at the end of whatever\ntype of sound is being made (whether it is air, a tone, etc.)  The student should not\nmove anything until the director calls the students to ready position.  This aspect\nof playing should transfer to any—and everything students play in the future (i.e.\nafter last notes of lines out of the book, last notes of songs, etc.)\n•  Whether students are making individual or group sounds, they need to stop when\nthey feel like they are running out of air.  It should never be thought of as a\ncontest to see who can hold their sounds the longest.  That serves absolutely no\nbenefit.\nIf a student feels dizzy or faint, allow them to bend over in their chair for a little\nwhile until they feel better.\nIf you feel or hear air escaping from the student’s embouchure, the student is most\nlikely not sealing properly.  This is usually caused by students pulling their\ncorners back.  Students need to constantly be told to bring their corners forward.\nAfter a student has been made aware that they are leaking air, the expectation\nshould be stated for the student to return to class the next day without that issue.\n•  While students are playing, it may be necessary to gently wiggle their mouthpiece\nfrom side to side, during which you will hear pitch variation.  This is simply\nmaking the student aware that their corners are not firm and/or their top teeth are\nnot on the top of the mouthpiece.  Ultimately, you should not be able to move the\nmouthpiece at all.\n•  The teacher should always forewarn a student before removing the mouthpiece\nfrom the student’s mouth.  The mouthpiece can easily scrape the teeth or create\ndiscomfort.\nIf you are too easily able to slide the mouthpiece out of a student’s mouth, their\ntop teeth are most likely not on the top of the mouthpiece like they should be.\nThis also means that students are holding the mouthpiece with their lips instead of\ntheir teeth.\n•  Extraneous noises at ends of sounds are a result of students collapsing their\nembouchures and/or postures.  Have students sing “la” or “dah”; then, apply that\nto the end of their sound.\nIt is your job, as the teacher, to diagnose any problems through this trial and error\nprocess.  As you go around the room, it may be helpful to you to take written\nnotes on students having problems.  Jot down any catchphrases, analogies or\nspecific things that you said to them that helped them in any way!\nIf you are struggling in your efforts to assist multiple students…..or are unsure\nabout what you are doing in general, then hire an outside consultant or\nexperienced private lesson teacher to come to your class and help.  As this\nprofessional goes around the room to hear your students, you need to follow\nthem……watch exactly what they are doing…..and take notes as well.  No\nmatter the scenario, reference these notes as you see fit in future classes.\nIf you have a large class, it may be necessary for “waiting” students to re-soak\ntheir reeds after ________ students have played.\n•  After _____ days, students will eventually need to be able to place their set-up\nand make a sound without your assistance.  The amount of time will vary year to\nyear, taking into consideration the size of the class, the overall quality of their\nsounds, and how many times you have assisted the students.\n•  Students need to constantly be reminded that characteristic and consistent\nset-up sounds are stepping stones to making sounds on the fully-assembled\nsaxophone!  Students who do not practice their set-up sounds at home are\nnot only slowing the class down, but are not contributing to the daily\nprogress and quality of the class.\n**Much of this information is applicable to beginner interviews.\nSAXOPHONE NECK AND MOUTHPIECE PITCHES\nIt is important when teaching embouchure to have students begin with the neck and mouthpiece.\nSounding pitches the saxophone neck and mouthpiece will produce:\nSoprano Saxophone\nw\n&\nwb\nw#(\n)\nTenor Saxophone\nBaritone Saxophone\nWhen teaching other concepts such as articulation and vibrato, have students begin on the neck and mouthpiece.\nCHARACTERISTICS OF A GOOD\nSAXOPHONE SOUND\nResonant\nConsistent\nRelaxed\nFull\nRich\nClear\nSmooth\nFocused\nVibrant\nCentered\nBuoyant\nOpen\nFree\nSAXOPHONE EXERCISES FOR GROUP SOUNDS\nGroup exercises—whether on the neck and mouthpiece (“short instrument” or “baby\ninstrument”) or the fully-assembled saxophone—should be performed with the assumption\nthat you have gone around the room as much as necessary before allowing students to\nmake sounds on their own in this group setting.\nYou must make the decision as to when to allow short instruments to go home with your\nThe use of mirrors is imperative so students are consistent with everything they are doing.\nBreathing should already be introduced by this point.\nThe metronome should already be introduced by this point.\nFor exercises 1-6, articulation has not been taught at this time; therefore, air starts are\nused.

Drill “ready position” and “playing/set position” DAILY.\na.  Call students to “ready position”….then to “playing/set position”……..and back\nto “ready position”, etc.  For shorter/faster instructions, simply say “ready” and\n“set/playing”.\nb.  Repeat this over and over and over.\nc.  This teaches students how to set their short instruments.\nd.  Students should look at their mirrors! DO NOT make them look at you.\n2.  Allow students to make sounds on their own.\na.  Students must exhibit good posture.\nb.  Students should be holding their short instrument correctly.\nc.  Students should be taking proper breaths.\nd.  You, the instructor, need to monitor students.  DO NOT bury your head in the\nstand.\nFor all exercises that use the metronome, make sure students lightly tap their right hand\nfingers on top of the neck for keeping track of the beats.  Quarter note = 80 (with\nsubdivisions) is a good tempo to perform all exercises at.\n3.   With a model playing (or you if saxophone is your primary instrument)\na.  All students should be looking at the model, who should be standing directly\ncentered and in front of the class.  The instructor should be walking around the\nclassroom and monitoring students.\nb.  There should never be an overlap of sound between the model and the class;\nalways place a whole rest between the model and the class.\nc.  Teach students the “start…stop” drill (using audiation).\nd.  The model and the entire class should breathe on beat 3 (when in 4/4 time).\ne.  Sound the subdivision on the metronome at ALL TIMES. Start this at the very\nbeginning.  If students are having trouble, help them with their foot tap by putting\nyour foot on top of theirs.\nf.  During rests and while the model is playing, you must talk to students about the\nnecessity about staying completely set.  This will more quickly help students to\nlearn where exactly to place their short instrument.  The students should look so\nstill to the point that they look like they are still playing!\ng.  The only embouchure movement that is allowed is for students that are having\ndifficulty making a sound…..and need to adjust something in order to achieve a\n4.

The model should be walking around the classroom with the instructor, so that all\nstudents can easily see the model’s embouchure, etc..\nd.  Depending on the size of your class, it is your decision to have students stay in\n“playing/set position” the entire time…..or instead allow students to be in\n“playing/set position” after every ___ students.\n5.  Have all students stand and individually play one sound; if they do not get a sound for\nany reason, they have to sit down.  (cid:1)\na.  The metronome is not used for this exercise.\nb.  Tell students that do not get sounds that they need to practice more at home!\nc.  Have some sort of incentive for those students who are still standing at the end of\none or more rotations.\n6.

Therefore, you must\nhave already taught articulation with the proper syllable before these lines can be\nattempted.\n•  WHEN YOU TEACH ARTICULATION, YOU MUST FIRST INTRODUCE IT\nON THE MOUTHPIECE AND NECK.\nSAXOPHONE - TEACHING FINGERINGS AND\nUSING FINGERING CHARTS\nIt is your choice whether or not you use the fingering chart in your book with your\n•  When you begin learning new notes, learn only a few notes per day.\no  DO NOT overwhelm your students!!\n•  Upper register notes should not be attempted until you have taught all necessary\nflexibility exercises in order to perform octave slurs (Set 1, Octave Slur Exercises and\nPalm Key Exercises).  By the end of the beginning year, all students should have\nmastered these vital exercises.\n•  Monitor unused fingers while students are playing.\no  NO FLY AWAY FINGERS!\n•  Make it your goal to teach new fingerings before you get to the new fingering (or even\nthe note itself) in the method book.\no  This will make the students feel like they are smart, and that they are moving\nmore quickly through the book\nSaxophone Fingering Chart\nA#/Bb\nB\nC\nC#/Db\nD\nD#/Eb\nE\nF\nF#/Gb\nRegular\nChromatic\nG\nG#/Ab\nA\nSAXOPHONE – EVEN EXERCISE\nThe “Even Exercise” is to instill even technique during the early stages of learning the\n•  Students must think “squeeze, release” throughout the exercise.\n•  This should be taught without using music at first and without a written rhythm.\nInstead, use the phrase “I must do this exercise” to express the rhythm.\n•  As presented on this page, use note names before using notes in the staff.

This also can be used as a Pre-Set to “SAXOPHONE SET 1.”\nSAXOPHONE – WORKING OUT BLIPS AND\nFINGER/TONGUE COORDINATION PROBLEMS\nBlips\nBlips can be defined as the uncoordinated movement of multiple fingers that should\nbe moving at the same time—but are not.  As with the teaching of all woodwind\ninstruments, the most problematic fingers in both hands are the ring finger and the\npinky.  Most blips occur with the use of either or both of these fingers.\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 1-2 involve moving\neither the LH/RH ring finger and pinky at the same time.\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 3-4 involve moving\neither the LH/RH middle finger, ring finger, and pinky at the same time.\n•  For lines 1-4:\n•  Students should articulate every note.\n•  Students can audiate the counting while they are positioning.\n•  Students can audiate the note names while they are positioning.\n•  Students can audiate “long…short long….short long…short long,” while\nthey are positioning.\nIn the event you have not yet taught dotted rhythms to your students, these\nexercises are already reinforcing a very challenging rhythm--in general--\nthat students will encounter all the way through their public school\nexperience.\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 5-6 involve moving\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 7-8 involve moving\n•  For lines 5-8:\n•  Students should slur every note.\n•  Students can perform these exercises without articulating.\n•  Using the same note names as lines 1-8, lines 9-12 are notated with the\nrhythms inverted.\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 9-10 involve moving\n•  Lines 11-12 involve moving either the LH/RH middle finger, ring finger, and\npinky at the same time.\n•  For lines 9-12:\n•  Students can audiate “short long…short long….short long…short,” while\n•  Using the same note names as lines 1-8, lines 13-16 are notated with the\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 13-14 involve moving\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 15-16 involve moving\n•  For lines 13-16:\nMISCELLANEOUS\n•  These exercises can be very effective, but must be audiated--in the various\nways previously discussed--and positioned at the same time.\n•  Playing tests can and should be given on these exercises to promote their\nregular practice.\n•  While positioning and/or performing these lines, it is imperative that students’\nfingers are hovering and staying very close to the keys.  If students’ fingers\nare too far away from the keys, these exercises will not be effective in\npreventing blips.\n•  Fingering patterns found in these exercises will more than likely appear in\nvirtually every genre of music, whether it be scales, All-Region/All-State\netudes, performance music, etc.\nFinger/Tongue Coordination Problems\nThere are two types of finger/tongue coordination problems that occur when passages are\narticulated:\n1.  students changing to the next fingering before they articulate (most common)\n2.  students articulating before they change to the next fingering\n•  Students can audiate the counting.\n•  Students can audiate the note names.\n•  Students can use their air and position through their embouchures—without\nactually producing sounds/vibrations.\nSAXOPHONE EXTENDED FINGER\nTECHNIQUES\nExtended finger techniques refer to the use of the pinky keys of the left and\nright hand as well as the palm keys. Developing efficient technique in these\nareas is vital to the student’s ability to play technically.\nPalm Keys (all played with the octave key)\n•  High D – “PK 1” (PK closest to the octave key)\no  Use the LH index finger; where the 1st (big) knuckle meets the\npalm.\no  Keep the other fingers curved and hovering over the pearls.\n•  High D # – “PK 1 and 2”\no  Use the LH index finger, 2nd (middle) knuckle\n*PK 2 is the highest key on the instrument (vertically) and\ncentered between the other two PKs (horizontally)\no  Keep the other fingers curved, relaxed, and hovering.\no  This is where tension begins to creep into the palm – keep it\nrelaxed.\n•  High E – “PK 1 and 2”  plus RH top side key\no  Left hand remains the same – keep it relaxed.\no  Add the top side key in the RH – use the space between the big\nand middle knuckle.\n(cid:1)  It is VERY IMPORTANT that the student’s right hand\nposition stay as close to normal as possible. Ensure the\nright hand fingers stay as close to hovering over the\npearls as possible. Students tend to contort and move the\nentire hand to activate this key, which is inefficient.\n•  High F – “PK 1, 2 and 3” plus RH top side key\no  Left hand adds the third palm key using the 2nd (middle\nknuckle) of the LH middle finger…not the index finger!\no  Keep the palm soft and relaxed.\no  Hand should remain curved.\no  Like high E, the RH hand position should stay as close to\nnormal as possible.\n*Remember, the higher the tone hole is, the higher the pitch is.\nBeginning students have smaller hands, so you will have to be forgiving if\ntheir hands are not quite big enough to execute the technique exactly as\nlisted. Some exceptions will have to be made. Have students practice palm\nkey exercises (provided) every other day for short intervals as their hands\nwill get tired.\nPinky Keys\nIt is most important that the pinkies to do not “lock up” when engaging these\nkeys in the left or right hand.\nRight Hand\n•  When moving from the D#/Eb (upstairs) key to the C (downstairs)\nkey, it is important to land on the roller, never past it.  Slide roller to\nroller, NOT key to key.\n•  Practice exercises moving from D#/Eb to C not playing and playing.\nPractice these in short intervals as the pinkies will get tired.  Teach\nyour students to work on these two or three times during their practice\nsession for short amounts of time every other day.\nLeft Hand\n•  When using the LH pinky, it is important that students NEVER pick\nthe pinky up when moving between keys!\n•  When using the C#/Db and the B key, slide roller to roller, NOT key\nto key.\n•  When using the A#/Bb key, students can either move roller to roller,\nor pivot the LH pinky down.  The pinky leans down and never leaves\nthe bottom of the B (inside) key, which means students must bring\ntheir hand lower.  The faster students play, the more they must pivot\nfrom their wrist.\no  The low A#/Bb keys on most Selmer saxophones can be raised\nby a skilled repairman, so there is less of a downwards motion.\n•  The B key is lower on all saxophones; however, a skilled repairman\ncan bend the key higher.\no  The B and C#/Db keys on beginner Yamaha saxophones should\nalready be flush.\n•  Practice exercises moving from C#/Db to B, and B to A#/Bb (harder).\nThe same practice rules apply.\nG #/ Ab (1)\nC# / Db (2)\n“outside”\nB (3) “inside”\nA# / Bb (4)\nYou can purchase PK and side key risers, which are black/rubber, at\nwww.wwbw.com.  They are very inexpensive (around $5 per set), are non-\nspecific, and can be used on any key.  These assist players with larger\nfingers, and decrease the distance the fingers have to travel to put the keys\ndown.  They tend to get loose over time, so buy a set as often as necessary.\nSAXOPHONE PALM KEY EXERCISES\n& 4\nœ\nœ#\nœb\n˙\nœn\n˙n\nÓ\n˙b\n9\n7\n10\n12\n13\n14\n16\n#œ\nb˙\n20\nbœ\n23\n18\n21\nn˙\n24\n26\n27\n©johnbenzer.com\n28\n8\n11\n15\n17\n19\n22\n25\nSAXOPHONE ARTICULATION\n•  Do not attempt to teach articulation until all students are producing characteristic\nand  consistent  sounds  on  the  neck  and  mouthpiece,  as  well  as  the  entire\nIntroduce articulation on the neck and mouthpiece.\n•  The tongue is down 98% and up 2% of the time.\n•  The tongue moves up and down, not back and forth.\n•  The tongue never touches the teeth or gums.\n•  The  purpose  of  the  tongue  is  to  release  the  air  which  causes  the  reed  to  vibrate\nwhich  creates  the  sound.    The  tongue’s  release  of  the  air  simply  defines  the\nbeginning/start of the vibration/sound.\n•  Articulation  is  used  to  define  the  vibrations  necessary  to  create  musical  rhythm,\nstyle  and  movement--to  contrast  the  use  of  slurring  (which  also  creates  similar\nmusical entities).\n•  One taste bud of the student’s tongue should touch where the flat part of the reed\nwhere the imaginary “dot” at the tip has been all along.  The tongue touches this\nspot, and immediately returns to its “at rest” position.\n•  The student must always touch and interrupt a vibrating reed.\n•  The articulation does not stop the reed vibration.\n•  There should be no movement in the face, chin or throat.  All that moves when the\nstudent articulates is the air and the tongue.\n•  The tongue must touch in the same spot with the same energy/strength every time.\nThe spot should be where the flat part of the reed meets the tip.\nYOU WILL NOW BE SHOWN COMBINED EXERCISES THAT WILL HELP\nIMPROVE THE STUDENT’S TONE QUALITY IN ALL OF THE REGISTERS,\nINCREASE RANGE, CREATE EVEN ARTICULATION IN ALL REGISTERS,\nAND TEACH YOUNG STUDENTS HOW TO CONTROL THE ENTIRE\nINSTRUMENT DURING THE FIRST YEAR.\nSAXOPHONE ARTICULATION EXERCISES\n•  When starting articulation exercises, the use of mirrors is vital.\n•  Remind students that the tongue only interrupts the air – it never stops the air.\n•  Articulating with black notes as opposed to white notes, encourages students to move\ntheir tongues down quicker.\n•  Make sure from the very beginning, students sing and play in a connected/legato style.\n•  Exercises to be taught in the following order:\n1.  Have students sing on “dah” and then ultimately on the French syllable “dih” or even\n“doo.” If students are unable to sing in a connected style, they should not progress to\nthe next step.\n2.  Have students put their hand or index finger in front of their face and feel their air.\nStudents should feel continuous air and not “puffs” of air.\n3.  Go around the room and have each student tongue air at your hand, so you can assess\ntheir ability to do it correctly.\n4.  Using a mirror, students should articulate with or without their hand/index finger,\nmaking sure that their face, chin, and throat are not moving.\n5.  When you feel students have mastered the previous exercises, allow them to articulate\n– using the syllable “dah” or “dih” – on the mouthpiece and neck.  Students should\nput their left hands under their neck so they can feel a continuous stream of air while\nthey are articulating.  Students who do not feel continuous air need to be verbally\nmade aware that they are not articulating correctly.\n** Students should start with their tongue on the reed to create the articulation.\nThe tongue then falls down and returns to its “at rest” position in the bottom of the\nmouth.  One taste bud of the student’s tongue should touch the flat part of the reed,\nwhere the imaginary “dot” at the tip has been all along.  The air and tongue go to\nthis same “dot.”\n6.  Allow students to articulate as fast as they can.\n7.  Allow the students to start the sound and use the \"ta-day\" syllable.\n8.  Allow the students to start the sound and articulate by snapping your finger on\ncommand.\n9.  With the metronome, begin to incorporate easy follow-the-leader rhythms with you\nsinging or modeling – and the students echoing on their mouthpiece and neck.  Whole\nrests may or may not be necessary between you and the students.  As with your initial\nsound production exercises, students need to continue counting with their fingers –\nwith their left hand – while they are playing.  This ensures that students are thinking\ninternal subdivision.\n10. Before progressing to the fully-assembled saxophone, assign the following playing\ntest on the mouthpiece and neck:\n•  Attach the mouthpiece and neck to the saxophone and begin articulation.  Students must\nbe constantly reminded that they should be articulating in the same way as they were\nwhen just using the mouthpiece and neck.\n•  Whether students are playing white notes or black notes, they must constantly be\nreminded that the tongue moves down quickly.\n•  When students can successfully sing note names on the same pitch, allow them to\narticulate multiple notes on the same pitch.\n•  When pulse and foot pat are learned, students articulate every time their foot touches the\nfloor – and then when their foot touches the floor and as it comes up.\n•  Once the student is able to read music, call the articulation \"rhythmic articulation\".\nStudents should be tonguing as the music moves across the page.\n•  Do not allow students to articulate back-to-back notes on different pitches until they are\nplaying with absolute connected style on notes of the same pitch.\n•  When the tongue is moving correctly, you must decide when it is appropriate to have\nstudents begin coordinating finger movement with articulation.\n•  When students articulate back-to-back notes on different pitches, they cannot stop their\nair as they change fingerings.\n•  Teach Mary Had a Little Lamb in four segments by singing and then playing:\n•  After all students have successfully played each segment of Mary Had a Little Lamb,\nbegin to string together the segments into the following finished product:\n•  Ultimately, students should be able to execute any or all of the following on a daily basis:\no  articulate as fast as they can\no  articulate using the \"ta-day\" syllable\no  articulate on command\no  articulate with foot pat and articulate rhythms\n•  When playing exercises out of the method book, you can return to previously-learned\nlines and add articulation.  Do not feel like all lines must be executed again during class;\nassign students to perform all lines at home with articulation.\nSAXOPHONE-LEVELS OF ACHIEVEMENT FOR\nARTICULATION\nIntroduces skill of tonguing and finger change at the same time\nIntroduces skill of tonguing and multiple finger changes within a measure\n4 Teaching Techniques\n1.

    "text": "BEGINNING SAXOPHONE CLASSROOM AND\nENSEMBLE SET-UP\nBeginning Classroom Set-Up\n•  Your beginning saxophone class should be taught in a smaller room (i.e. ensemble room\nor secondary band hall).\n•  Configure your classroom based on how many students you have in the class.\n•  Start off the semester by putting students in alphabetical order so you can learn their\nnames faster.  Once music stands and mirrors are utilized in class, hanging name tags can\ncontinue to help you learn student names quicker. These can and should also be used on\nany days you have clinicians/consultants visit.\nTypes of Band Hall Set-Ups\n1.  Arched set-up\n(cid:1)\nIf using your “ensemble set-up” for your class, have students sit in a “box,” so all\nstudents receive the same amount of attention/eye contact from you.\n(cid:1)  Have students sit in every other chair (if all chairs have to remain in your set-up\nthroughout the day).\n(cid:1)  The aisles between your rows must be large enough so that you will have quick and\neasy access to any student--both from the front and the back.\n(cid:1)  As much as possible, have students in “windows.”\n(cid:1)  You must be able to see each student from the front and the back.  With that said, you\nare not always able to correct student’s posture, hand position, etc. from the front of\nthe room; thus, you need to be walking around the room instead of “parking” on a\nstool!\n(cid:1)  Once you start determining playing ability levels of your students, place weaker\nplayers in the front of the classroom and stronger players in the back. Less attention is\ntypically given to players who are further back in the set-up.\n2.  Horseshoe set-up\n(cid:1)  This set-up is not recommended because you have a limited range of vision.\nIf you decide to use this set-up, you will need to pull the stand/podium far enough\nback in order to have clear vision of every student.\n3.  Arched with aisle\n(cid:1)  This is a very acceptable set-up, even with full ensembles.\n4.  Straight line set-up\n(cid:1)  This type of set-up should only be used with bigger facilities.\nIn order for you to have visual contact with all of the students, the students on the\nends of the rows will have to adjust their chairs/ bodies towards you or you need to\nhave them sitting in a “box” (see arched set-up).\n5.  Straight line set-up with aisle\nAISLE\n6.  Circular set up\n(cid:1)  One teacher teaches from the inside and one from the periphery. Students face in\ntowards middle.\nIf you are teaching alone, it will be too hard to maneuver when teaching outside of\nthe circle.\n(cid:1)  This set-up is typical in elementary school cafeterias or small stage “cafetoriums.”\nEnsemble Room Set-Up\n•  Beginner Classroom set-up\n•  Remember: 90% of tone holes are on the right side of the instrument\nFull Ensemble Set-Up\n•  Saxophone players need to be in the middle of the ensemble. The first chair alto\nsaxophone player should be near the 1st French horn player so they can more easily\nbalance and match in terms of balance, pitch, etc.\nAlto Sax\n1\n2\n3\nTS\nBS\nHorns\n•  There should be a pod of low woodwinds—who should be sitting relatively close to each\nother--since these instruments tend to have similar parts in their music.\n•  Low saxophone players should never be placed with the low brass in the back of the\nensemble…regardless of whether or not risers are utilized.\nTrombone\nTuba\nB Sax  T Sax (cid:2)\nLow Saxes\nLow Clar.\nBassoons\nClar.\nFlutes\nSaxophone Quartet\nUniversity of Houston Set-up\nAS                     BS\nAS\nSS\nOR\nSS                              TS\nAudience\n•  The set-up should always form an arc with all players. This makes communication easier\nsince standing on the outside would place them in the blind spot of the other two\nmusicians.\n•  The two inner voices (alto and tenor) should not stand next to each other. This helps with\nbalance and prevents these two voices from getting lost in complex passages or in\nsituations where they function as a solo voice.\n•  All players should be angling their bodies and instruments in towards the audience.\n•  The set-up is subject to change depending on the strengths and weaknesses of each player\nas well as the repertoire being performed."

Metal mouthpieces should not be used under any\nother circumstances.\n•  Students are recommended to keep their “beginner” mouthpiece and\nligature if and when they move to a step-up instrument, so they can\nuse them for marching band.\n•  Selmer “Soloist” mouthpieces\no  Chamber of mouthpiece is too large\nLigatures to avoid:\n•  Rovner and BG leather\no  Eats up the sound\no  Produces a darker, non-resonant sound\no  Prohibits reed vibration\no  Does not hold the reed properly, resulting in the ligature\nslipping\no  Material stretches over time\n***If you do use these ligatures, the fabric is on the side of the reed and\nthe screw is on the right.\nHow to store the mouthpiece and ligature:\n•  Do not allow students to leave:\no  the reed they are currently playing on the mouthpiece\no  the assembled mouthpiece and ligature in the case\nThis usually happens because students are lazy or not given enough\ntime to clean their instruments. (cid:1)\n•  Do NOT allow students to simply store the assembled  mouthpiece\nand ligature in the case!\n•  Ideal way to store the mouthpiece/ligature:\no  Students should put an unused, dry reed (that has never been\nplayed on before) on their mouthpiece which is secured by the\nligature while it is stored.  Tighten the screw to its first point of\nresistance.  This prevents the ligature from losing shape and the\nface of the mouthpiece being scratched.\no  Students should have a plastic mouthpiece cap over the\nmouthpiece/reed/ligature while in the case at all times.  Caps\nprotect the entire “set-up.”\nCleaning the mouthpiece:\n•  After EACH CLASS, students need to use the end of their silk swab\nto dry out the receiver and tip of the mouthpiece.  It is recommended\nto use the pinky so that it can fit into the receiver and the tip.\n•  At home, students are recommended to clean the inside of the\nmouthpiece by using a damp cloth with warm running water and\nantibacterial soap.\n•  At home, students are recommended to clean the outside of the\nmouthpiece by putting it in a tea/coffee cup with water and lemon\njuice or vinegar. The mouthpiece can be submerged. This should be\ndone at least 1-2 times a year for 30 minutes. Be aware that the\nexterior of the mouthpiece can turn brown/yellow/green for 1-2\nweeks, because of the sulfur in the rubber.\n•  When cleaning the outsides of mouthpieces, students should be very\ncareful not to scratch the mouthpiece with any hard brushes, sponges\nor “other” things (ligature, pencil, pen, etc.).\n•  DO NOT BOIL THE MOUTHPIECE OR USE HOT WATER TO\nCLEAN IT! It is hard rubber, and will be destroyed!"

    "text": "TUBA INSTRUMENT/BODY RATIO AND HAND POSITION\nInstrument/Body Ratio/Instrument Carriage\nAssuming that the student is either sitting with correct posture, instruct them to pick up the body of the tuba with both arms and simply move it into position on their laps.  As students are doing this, have them notice how it affects the balance of the body.  Eventually, the body should feel as balanced with or without the instrument in hand.\nMake sure students bring instruments to them… and not them to the instruments.  When done incorrectly, their body collapses and their air is obstructed.\nShelf liner can be placed on the right leg…or draped across both legs…to help establish correct posture and positioning of the instrument.\nDepending on the size of the student and the space they have to work with, a tuba stand could be used.  It is important that when using a tuba stand, students are not contorting their bodies or doing anything abnormal.\nShoulders should be straight across when facing the director and it should feel the same way when doing breathing exercises  (do not twist or shift the upper body out of the breathing position)\nThe tuba should not be slanted in a manner in which moves the students’ head from its natural position.\nAngles of mouthpieces should be slightly lower than level.\nHand Position\nThe most natural shape of everyone’s hands forms a flat “C”.\nAll hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall behind the wrist.\nThere should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the tuba.\nThe inside of the arms must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding the tuba correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\nElbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be hampered.\nPlace both the left and the right hand in their correct position.  Remember the left hand does not “grip” the instrument.  No tension should be felt in this hand when holding the instrument.\nThe left hand should not contain any tension, as it holds the majority of the weight of the instrument.  The palm of the left hand should be placed naturally across the body of the tuba (similar to holding a baby).\nThe thumb must never bend in any direction!  The index, middle, ring finger, and pinky are curved and the fleshy part of the fingertips are placed on the pearls of the valve caps (for piston valves), and on the largest part of the rotary (for rotary valves).  The fleshy part of the fingertips should never lose contact with these specific areas.\nRight hand fingers should have curvature; the pads of the fingers should not extend past the pearls (or too far down any given rotary valve), which incorrectly results students playing with flat fingers.\nStudents with fourth valves must move their pinky (NOT third finger) in the same manner that they move their other valves.  Students will have to build finger strength and dexterity once starting to play an instrument with four valves.\nThough not a part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling the instrument toward the student’s face.  Instruct students to keep their elbows soft while playing the tuba.\nThe palms of both hands should feel soft.  Regardless of whether piston or rotary valves are used, the palm of the right hand should never touch the instrument.\nThe student should understand that finger movement is aided by the soft tissue of the palm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand.\nSpecific Information Regarding Piston Valves\nPiston valves are approached basically the same as trumpet.\nThe right hand thumb and 1st finger should point in same direction when playing top action piston valves.  The thumb should not be wrapped around the valve casing…which results in the palm collapsing into the cross brace.\nThe right hand thumb is placed in its natural position with the side/very tip of the right hand thumb being the only thing that touches the bottom of the cross brace.\nIf the student’s right hand is in the correct position, the teacher should be able to clearly see a “circular” opening between the right hand and the instrument.\nSpecific Information Regarding Rotary Valves\nRotary valves are basically approached the same as French horn.\nThe right hand thumb and 1st finger should point in the same direction when playing rotary valves.  The thumb should be placed naturally into the thumb ring without any tension in the hand.\nThe palm should not collapse into the body of the instrument."

    "text": "TUBA MAINTENANCE\nMouthpiece Maintenance\nOver time, grime and other dirty objects build up in the mouthpiece.\nTo clean the mouthpiece:\nTake a mouthpiece brush and run it through the mouthpiece under warm water in the sink.\nThe brush will not go all the way through, so insert the brush to the throat, twist and pull out.\nSoap is not necessary, but it does not hurt the mouthpiece to use it. The same goes for mouthwash. If these are used, simply rinse the mouthpiece thoroughly afterwards and let it air dry so that the alcohol evaporates.\nThis process should be done every week to two weeks.\nSlide Maintenance\nThe insides of the slides and various tubes build up grime, various dirt particles, and germs, so the slides must be snaked at least once a month.\nTo snake a horn:\nTake out the appropriate slide, pressing down the appropriate valve while taking it out, and place the slide on a towel or soft surface.\nRun water through the unattached slide, preferably in the opposite direction of air flow.\nIn the case of the main tuning slide and the lead pipe, also run water through the lead pipe – starting on the end with the tuning slide, not the end with the mouthpiece receiver.\nTake the snake and run it through the slide which was taken out, preferably in the opposite direction of air flow.\nRepeat the above step with all slides, including the main tuning slide, the 1st valve slide, 2nd valve slide, 3rd valve slide, and 4th valve slide.\nApply slide grease as necessary according to the below steps.\nDepending on the model of tuba, there can be many slides that require maintenance. Each of these must be well-lubricated with slide grease. Refer to the “Maintenance Kit” handout for pictures of slide greases.\nTo apply the grease:\nTake out the slide to be greased, pressing down the appropriate valve.\nWith some cheesecloth, wipe off the slide to clean the grease and any grime on the slide.\nIf the grease is a liquid, squeeze the bottle and apply a line of grease down two sides of the slide. If the grease is more of a cream, use the index finger to apply the grease along most of the length of the slide.\nDo not apply too much grease, as the slides can become too lubricated and fall out.\nRe-insert the slide and slide it fully in and out a few times. Insert only one side of the slide in and rotate the slide while moving it in and out. Press down the appropriate valve the entire time during this process.\nPush the slide all the way in and use a paper towel to wipe off any extra grease located where the immovable and movable parts of the slide meet.\nRepeat this process for all slides as needed.\nThis process should be done every month or so.\nValve Maintenance\nIf consistently played on, a tuba should have no “sticky valves” for a few weeks.\nOn the other hand, a tuba that is not played on for 2-3 days in a row the valve can begin to stick.\nTo re-oil the valves:\nBegin twisting from the top valve cap until the cap comes off of the valve casing.\nHolding the valve by the finger button, completely remove the valve without twisting or rotating it inside the casing.\nWith some cheesecloth, wipe down any old oil from the piston.\nApply a healthy coat of oil on the whole piston, but do not intentionally apply any oil inside the ports as it will simply go to waste once air is blown through the horn.\nTake a look inside the valve casing:\nThere should be two notches on the sides of the valve casing; this is where the guides on the valve will be placed.\nOne notch should be slightly bigger/different from the other one. Be sure to align the correct guide with the correct slot.\nCarefully insert the valve, without twisting or rotating it, inside the appropriate valve casing.\nRepeat for any other “sticky” valves."

    "text": "TUBA COMPENSATING SYSTEM\nA compensating system is commonly found on more intermediate and advanced tubas; this system is not typically used on beginner instruments.\nA compensating tuba works exactly like a compensating, just an octave lower.\nThe compensating system works like the F-attachment on trombone.  When 4th valve is depressed, the instrument is pitched in the key of F.\nThe compensating system allows for the possibility to play a full chromatic scale between the 1st and 2nd partials (low B-flat – low E specifically)\nWith all valves depressed on a compensating Bb tuba (1-2-3-4), the instrument will sound a low B-natural.  That same valve combination on a non-compensating tuba will only produce a low C.  This makes the low B-natural a non-existent note on a non-compensating horn.\nWhen using a compensating-style instrument, one has the advantage of being able to play lower octaves using conventional fingerings and pressing down 4th valve (for example, below the staff D-flat would be played 2-3).  To play the octave below, one would depress the 2-3-valve combination and add 4th valve.  This would be a different fingering on a non-compensating tuba (1-3-4)\nHaving a compensating tuba is extremely beneficial in extending the lower range chromatically.\n1-3 and 1-2-3 valve combinations can be played 4 and 2-4, respectively, to help with resonance, clarity, and tuning difficulties.\nMost 4th valves will be located directly next to the 3rd valve, and is to be played with the right hand pinky only.\nSome compensating tubas will have a 5th valve that is activated with the right hand thumb or left hand index finger. This 5th valve can either be a rotary valve or a trigger.\nNot all 4 valve instruments are compensating; you must look behind the valves to see if the instrument includes extra tubing that goes through the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd valves."

    "text": "TUBA FLEXIBILITY AND RANGE EXTENSION\nBrass playing is based upon flexibility.\nThere are two types of flexibility: flexibility within the instrument and flexibility within the note.\nStudents eventually need to be flexible through each of the harmonic series in order to move up and down within the range of the instrument.\nOnce the student can reproduce at will a given pitch, the teacher must decide whether flexibility up or down is needed first.\nFlexibility is controlled by air direction and the isometrics created by the corners and canine/eye teeth.  The head must always stay in its natural, balanced position at all times.  The angle of the instrument must not change at any time.\nStudents must learn to angle the air in the cup of the mouthpiece without changing the position of the lips and/or the relationship of the upper and lower teeth.\nFlexibility is also enhanced by vowel sounds used in various registers.  These sounds can be “ah” for the middle register….”ee” for the upper register….and “oh” for the lower register.  Have students practice saying these vowel sounds with vocalization on appropriate lower, middle and higher sounds.\nThe speed of the air and the shape of the vowel guide flexibility.  The tongue assists the air speed similar to the way one’s thumb assists the water speed from a hose.  The tongue relaxes when descending into the lower register and arches when ascending into the upper register.\nBring to the students’ attention that the shape of the tongue changes dramatically from vowel sound to vowel sound.  All students should be aware that vowel sounds are the middles of words that they speak every day.  Practice saying words that use the required vowel sounds (i.e.  bow, ball, beep).\nRange is developed through flexibility.  It is more important to create a resonant sound while practicing flexibility than to create wider intervals.  The student can enhance their range by making more resonant sounds in the middle register before trying to extend higher or lower.\nWhile it is important to create resonant sounds in the register students can play in, it is important for students to occasionally try exploring both the upper and lower range they struggle to make a good sound in.  This should be practiced perhaps twice a week.\nMake sure students understand the texture of the lips have nothing to do with range. For example, students should never be told to “tighten” their lips in order to play in the higher register."

The same goes for mouthwash. If these are used, simply rinse the mouthpiece thoroughly afterwards and let it air dry so that the alcohol evaporates.\nThis process should be done every week to two weeks.\nSlide Maintenance\nThe insides of the slides and various tubes build up grime, various dirt particles, and germs, so the slides must be snaked at least once a month.\nTo snake a horn:\nTake out the appropriate slide, pressing down the appropriate valve while taking it out, and place the slide on a towel or soft surface.\nRun water through the unattached slide, preferably in the opposite direction of air flow.\nIn the case of the main tuning slide and the lead pipe, also run water through the lead pipe – starting on the end with the tuning slide, not the end with the mouthpiece receiver.\nTake the snake and run it through the slide which was taken out, preferably in the opposite direction of air flow.\nRepeat the above step with all slides, including the main tuning slide, the 1st valve slide, 2nd valve slide, 3rd valve slide, and 4th valve slide.\nApply slide grease as necessary according to the below steps.\nDepending on the model of tuba, there can be many slides that require maintenance. Each of these must be well-lubricated with slide grease. Refer to the “Maintenance Kit” handout for pictures of slide greases.\nTo apply the grease:\nTake out the slide to be greased, pressing down the appropriate valve.\nWith some cheesecloth, wipe off the slide to clean the grease and any grime on the slide.\nIf the grease is a liquid, squeeze the bottle and apply a line of grease down two sides of the slide. If the grease is more of a cream, use the index finger to apply the grease along most of the length of the slide.\nDo not apply too much grease, as the slides can become too lubricated and fall out.\nRe-insert the slide and slide it fully in and out a few times. Insert only one side of the slide in and rotate the slide while moving it in and out. Press down the appropriate valve the entire time during this process.\nPush the slide all the way in and use a paper towel to wipe off any extra grease located where the immovable and movable parts of the slide meet.\nRepeat this process for all slides as needed.\nThis process should be done every month or so.\nValve Maintenance\nIf consistently played on, a tuba should have no “sticky valves” for a few weeks.\nOn the other hand, a tuba that is not played on for 2-3 days in a row the valve can begin to stick.\nTo re-oil the valves:\nBegin twisting from the top valve cap until the cap comes off of the valve casing.\nHolding the valve by the finger button, completely remove the valve without twisting or rotating it inside the casing.\nWith some cheesecloth, wipe down any old oil from the piston.\nApply a healthy coat of oil on the whole piston, but do not intentionally apply any oil inside the ports as it will simply go to waste once air is blown through the horn.\nTake a look inside the valve casing:\nThere should be two notches on the sides of the valve casing; this is where the guides on the valve will be placed.\nOne notch should be slightly bigger/different from the other one. Be sure to align the correct guide with the correct slot.\nCarefully insert the valve, without twisting or rotating it, inside the appropriate valve casing.\nRepeat for any other “sticky” valves.\nTUBA METHOD BOOKS\nSUPPLEMENTAL TUBA BOOKS\nTUBA CASES, IDENTIFICATION OF PARTS AND REMOVING IT FROM ITS CASE\nGeneral Information About All Brass Cases\nMost cases have distinguishing marks somewhere on the case.  Identify these marks, and their relationship to the top and bottom of the case.  Most cases have the handles placed on the bottom section of each case.  Check to make sure.\nPlace all tuba cases on the floor in front of the student.\nBe sure the student understands where and which direction each part of the instrument belongs in the case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make sure the student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure the parts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse order they were removed.\nThe tuba should be removed first, followed by the mouthpiece.  When putting instrument back, the order is reversed – mouthpiece first, followed by the tuba.\nAll instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure explicitly every time.\nNever leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up, but this is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.  Check each opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to your students.\nCases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom setup for each student’s case.  If using an ensemble room for the class, the cases may be opened in the hall.  The empty case will remain closed and latched in the hall during class.\nWhen instruments are in their cases, do not allow students to sit on their cases AT ANY TIME because the lead pipe and/or bell will get bent.\nPARTS OF THE TUBA\nTUBA INSTRUMENT/BODY RATIO AND HAND POSITION\nInstrument/Body Ratio/Instrument Carriage\nAssuming that the student is either sitting with correct posture, instruct them to pick up the body of the tuba with both arms and simply move it into position on their laps.  As students are doing this, have them notice how it affects the balance of the body.  Eventually, the body should feel as balanced with or without the instrument in hand.\nMake sure students bring instruments to them… and not them to the instruments.  When done incorrectly, their body collapses and their air is obstructed.\nShelf liner can be placed on the right leg…or draped across both legs…to help establish correct posture and positioning of the instrument.\nDepending on the size of the student and the space they have to work with, a tuba stand could be used.  It is important that when using a tuba stand, students are not contorting their bodies or doing anything abnormal.\nShoulders should be straight across when facing the director and it should feel the same way when doing breathing exercises  (do not twist or shift the upper body out of the breathing position)\nThe tuba should not be slanted in a manner in which moves the students’ head from its natural position.\nAngles of mouthpieces should be slightly lower than level.\nHand Position\nThe most natural shape of everyone’s hands forms a flat “C”.\nAll hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall behind the wrist.\nThere should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the tuba.\nThe inside of the arms must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding the tuba correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\nElbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be hampered.\nPlace both the left and the right hand in their correct position.  Remember the left hand does not “grip” the instrument.  No tension should be felt in this hand when holding the instrument.\nThe left hand should not contain any tension, as it holds the majority of the weight of the instrument.  The palm of the left hand should be placed naturally across the body of the tuba (similar to holding a baby).\nThe thumb must never bend in any direction!  The index, middle, ring finger, and pinky are curved and the fleshy part of the fingertips are placed on the pearls of the valve caps (for piston valves), and on the largest part of the rotary (for rotary valves).  The fleshy part of the fingertips should never lose contact with these specific areas.\nRight hand fingers should have curvature; the pads of the fingers should not extend past the pearls (or too far down any given rotary valve), which incorrectly results students playing with flat fingers.\nStudents with fourth valves must move their pinky (NOT third finger) in the same manner that they move their other valves.  Students will have to build finger strength and dexterity once starting to play an instrument with four valves.\nThough not a part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling the instrument toward the student’s face.  Instruct students to keep their elbows soft while playing the tuba.\nThe palms of both hands should feel soft.  Regardless of whether piston or rotary valves are used, the palm of the right hand should never touch the instrument.\nThe student should understand that finger movement is aided by the soft tissue of the palm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand.\nSpecific Information Regarding Piston Valves\nPiston valves are approached basically the same as trumpet.\nThe right hand thumb and 1st finger should point in same direction when playing top action piston valves.  The thumb should not be wrapped around the valve casing…which results in the palm collapsing into the cross brace.\nThe right hand thumb is placed in its natural position with the side/very tip of the right hand thumb being the only thing that touches the bottom of the cross brace.\nIf the student’s right hand is in the correct position, the teacher should be able to clearly see a “circular” opening between the right hand and the instrument.\nSpecific Information Regarding Rotary Valves\nRotary valves are basically approached the same as French horn.\nThe right hand thumb and 1st finger should point in the same direction when playing rotary valves.  The thumb should be placed naturally into the thumb ring without any tension in the hand.\nThe palm should not collapse into the body of the instrument.\nTUBA FACE/EMBOUCHURE\nEach student should use their own “safe/unbreakable” mirror—both in the classroom and at home.\nUsing the mirror, have each student notice how natural their face looks.  They will have to later remember and memorize how it looks and feels.\nThe head must be balanced on the shoulders in a comfortable position—not too far forward and not too far backward.\nThe eyes should be soft and natural, and the “sight line” should be exactly level.  The distance between eyebrows should not change as air goes in and out of the body.\nLook for natural creases in the face, and allow any that are naturally present to exist while playing.  No other creases are allowed.\nThe corners should move in toward the canine/eye teeth.  The corners should never look or feel pulled back.\nThe corners can move down from the natural position as the student progresses but they can never move up.\nThe texture of both the upper and lower lip should be very soft and relaxed.\nThere should be natural space between the inside of the lips and the gums and teeth.  This space should not change or feel different when the lips vibrate inside the cup of the mouthpiece.\nThe back teeth are slightly apart and should feel the same as when the student is reading, watching television, etc.  The teeth should not be pressed into each other when doing these other activities.\nBrass instrument embouchures are formed with a natural overbite.  A student with an underbite should be steered away from brass instrument.\nThe thickness of a student’s lips should correspond to the size of the cup of the mouthpiece for the chosen instrument.  Students with a very full top or bottom lip should be steered towards low brass instruments rather than trumpet.\nThe bottom of the front of the tongue should lie in the soft tissue area which is located in the front of the mouth just behind the ridge of the bottom gum.\nRemember that when playing the tuba, cheeks will only “puff out” if the air is not freely going into the instrument.\nAssuming that the above has been achieved, the embouchure will be formed with special attention to the following:\nThe mouthpiece must be placed in the middle of the mouth—up and down as well as side to side.\nThe corners are in their natural position and should be set against the canine/eye teeth.\nThe lips must be allowed to freely vibrate in response to the airstream rather than made to “buzz” in front of the airstream.\nThe lips must feel natural so that air can freely move past them—they must not be pulled back against the teeth or blown away from the teeth and gums.\nThe students should remember that the mouthpiece “gathers” the air—not the lips.\nThere must never be more energy placed against the upper lip than the lower lip; hence the instrument will angle slightly downwards.\nTUBA ARTICULATION\nThe tongue moves in the same manner when articulating a brass instrument as it does when you speak.  The tongue moves up and down—not back and forth—both when speaking and when articulation on an instrument.\nThe purpose of the tongue is to release the air which causes the lips to vibrate and creates the sound.  The tongue’s release of the air simply defines the beginning/start of the vibration/sound.\nArticulation is used to define the vibrations necessary to create musical rhythm, style and movement--to contrast the use of slurring (which also creates similar musical entities).\nThe students should think that the tongue “articulates” the sound created by the airstream.  If the student is taught to create the sound correctly, articulation will be an easy transition.\nsound occurs when the air moves past the naturally vibrating lips\narticulate the sound that is already present\nteach students to articulate at the moment the sound begins\nWithout the instrument or mouthpiece, use the following procedure:\n1.   Say the word “DOG”.\nSing the syllable “DAH”.\nOnce these are mastered, have the student use the mouthpiece and instrument and reproduce the “DAH” syllable in their brain to create an articulated sound.\nThe tongue should feel the same when saying, singing and playing the mouthpiece and instrument.\nThe tongue should touch the enamel of the upper teeth directly below the gum line—in the same spot with the same strength every time.\nUse the syllable “DAH” because it creates smoother and more easily controlled air as opposed to the “TAH” syllable.\nAfter each “articulation”, the tongue must immediately fall down into its natural “at rest” position.\nThe tongue will be naturally soft at all times, but can touch the teeth with different strengths.\nThe tongue will be in its “down position” 98% of the time when articulating correctly.\nHave the student start their sound with the air.\nUsing the information about the basics of articulation, have the student articulate as fast as they can with no limitations of numbers, worries about evenness of articulation, etc.  Simply get them used to articulating!\nHave the student then use the “ta-day” syllable to practice using the tongue in an organized manner.\nHave the student then articulate “on command.”  The student will start their sound, and articulate when you snap your fingers to practice gaining more control of the tongue.\nOnce the student understands pulse and the foot pat, have the student articulate exactly when the toe of the foot touches the floor.\nHave the student articulate with the down and up position of the foot.\nProceed to written rhythms as they begin to read music.\nAlways practice this entire routine.  The student must always go through the entire process, so he will not lose the ability to move his tongue at various speeds and in a structured manner.\nTUBA FLEXIBILITY AND RANGE EXTENSION\nBrass playing is based upon flexibility.\nThere are two types of flexibility: flexibility within the instrument and flexibility within the note.\nStudents eventually need to be flexible through each of the harmonic series in order to move up and down within the range of the instrument.\nOnce the student can reproduce at will a given pitch, the teacher must decide whether flexibility up or down is needed first.\nFlexibility is controlled by air direction and the isometrics created by the corners and canine/eye teeth.  The head must always stay in its natural, balanced position at all times.  The angle of the instrument must not change at any time.\nStudents must learn to angle the air in the cup of the mouthpiece without changing the position of the lips and/or the relationship of the upper and lower teeth.\nFlexibility is also enhanced by vowel sounds used in various registers.  These sounds can be “ah” for the middle register….”ee” for the upper register….and “oh” for the lower register.  Have students practice saying these vowel sounds with vocalization on appropriate lower, middle and higher sounds.\nThe speed of the air and the shape of the vowel guide flexibility.  The tongue assists the air speed similar to the way one’s thumb assists the water speed from a hose.  The tongue relaxes when descending into the lower register and arches when ascending into the upper register.\nBring to the students’ attention that the shape of the tongue changes dramatically from vowel sound to vowel sound.  All students should be aware that vowel sounds are the middles of words that they speak every day.  Practice saying words that use the required vowel sounds (i.e.  bow, ball, beep).\nRange is developed through flexibility.  It is more important to create a resonant sound while practicing flexibility than to create wider intervals.  The student can enhance their range by making more resonant sounds in the middle register before trying to extend higher or lower.\nWhile it is important to create resonant sounds in the register students can play in, it is important for students to occasionally try exploring both the upper and lower range they struggle to make a good sound in.  This should be practiced perhaps twice a week.\nMake sure students understand the texture of the lips have nothing to do with range. For example, students should never be told to “tighten” their lips in order to play in the higher register.\nTUBA COMPENSATING SYSTEM\nA compensating system is commonly found on more intermediate and advanced tubas; this system is not typically used on beginner instruments.\nA compensating tuba works exactly like a compensating euphonium, just an octave lower.\nThe compensating system works like the F-attachment on trombone.  When 4th valve is depressed, the instrument is pitched in the key of F.\nThe compensating system allows for the possibility to play a full chromatic scale between the 1st and 2nd partials (low B-flat – low E specifically)\nWith all valves depressed on a compensating Bb tuba (1-2-3-4), the instrument will sound a low B-natural.  That same valve combination on a non-compensating tuba will only produce a low C.  This makes the low B-natural a non-existent note on a non-compensating horn.\nWhen using a compensating-style instrument, one has the advantage of being able to play lower octaves using conventional fingerings and pressing down 4th valve (for example, below the staff D-flat would be played 2-3).  To play the octave below, one would depress the 2-3-valve combination and add 4th valve.  This would be a different fingering on a non-compensating tuba (1-3-4)\nHaving a compensating tuba is extremely beneficial in extending the lower range chromatically.\n1-3 and 1-2-3 valve combinations can be played 4 and 2-4, respectively, to help with resonance, clarity, and tuning difficulties.\nMost 4th valves will be located directly next to the 3rd valve, and is to be played with the right hand pinky only.\nSome compensating tubas will have a 5th valve that is activated with the right hand thumb or left hand index finger. This 5th valve can either be a rotary valve or a trigger.\nNot all 4 valve instruments are compensating; you must look behind the valves to see if the instrument includes extra tubing that goes through the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd valves.\nTUBA GENERAL TUNING TENDENCIES\nThe Overtone Series\nThere are 7 possible combinations of fingerings:\nOpen\n2\n1\n1-2 (3rd valve alone is about the same length)\n2-3\n1-3 (4)\n1-2-3 (2-4)\nEach valve combination plays a series of slotted notes. Displayed below are all the possible notes that can be played without pressing any valves down (open).\nThe order of valve combinations listed above will lower every note on the staff by a half-step.  The lowest note on the 2nd valve combination would be an A…the 1st valve combination would be an Ab, etc.\nBecause each overtone series is in tune with itself, switching between all 7 will cause tuning tendencies.\nTo overcome a tuning tendency, the following can be done:\nValve slide adjustment\nVowel shape/air direction adjustment\nAlternate fingering\nBefore going over which adjustment should be used when, it is important to go over the specific tuning tendencies."

Students with a very full top or bottom lip should be steered towards low brass instruments rather than trumpet.\nThe bottom of the front of the tongue should lie in the soft tissue area which is located in the front of the mouth just behind the ridge of the bottom gum.\nRemember that when playing the tuba, cheeks will only “puff out” if the air is not freely going into the instrument.\nAssuming that the above has been achieved, the embouchure will be formed with special attention to the following:\nThe mouthpiece must be placed in the middle of the mouth—up and down as well as side to side.\nThe corners are in their natural position and should be set against the canine/eye teeth.\nThe lips must be allowed to freely vibrate in response to the airstream rather than made to “buzz” in front of the airstream.\nThe lips must feel natural so that air can freely move past them—they must not be pulled back against the teeth or blown away from the teeth and gums.\nThe students should remember that the mouthpiece “gathers” the air—not the lips.\nThere must never be more energy placed against the upper lip than the lower lip; hence the instrument will angle slightly downwards."

Take a mouthpiece brush and run it through the mouthpiece under warm\nwater in the sink.\n(cid:2)  The brush will not go all the way through, so insert the brush to the\nthroat, twist and pull out.\n(cid:2)  Soap is not necessary, but it does not hurt the mouthpiece to use it.\nThe same goes for mouthwash. If these are used, simply rinse the\nmouthpiece thoroughly afterwards and let it air dry so that the\nalcohol evaporates.\n•  This process should be done every week to two weeks.\nSlide Maintenance\n•  The insides of the slides and various tubes build up grime, various dirt particles,\nand germs, so the slides must be snaked at least once a month.\n•  To snake a horn:\n1.  Take out the appropriate slide, pressing down the appropriate valve while\ntaking it out, and place the slide on a towel or soft surface.\n2.  Run water through the unattached slide, preferably in the opposite\ndirection of air flow.\n(cid:2)\nIn the case of the main tuning slide and the lead pipe, also run\nwater through the lead pipe – starting on the end with the tuning\nslide, not the end with the mouthpiece receiver.\n3.  Take the snake and run it through the slide which was taken out,\npreferably in the opposite direction of air flow.\n4.  Repeat the above step with all slides, including the main tuning slide, the\n1st valve slide, 2nd valve slide, 3rd valve slide, and 4th valve slide.\n5.  Apply slide grease as necessary according to the below steps.\n•  Depending on the model of tuba, there can be many slides that require\nmaintenance. Each of these must be well-lubricated with slide grease. Refer to the\n“Maintenance Kit” handout for pictures of slide greases.\n•  To apply the grease:\n1.  Take out the slide to be greased, pressing down the appropriate valve.\n2.  With some cheesecloth, wipe off the slide to clean the grease and any\ngrime on the slide.\n3.  If the grease is a liquid, squeeze the bottle and apply a line of grease down\ntwo sides of the slide. If the grease is more of a cream, use the index finger\nto apply the grease along most of the length of the slide.\n(cid:2)  Do not apply too much grease, as the slides can become too\nlubricated and fall out.\n4.  Re-insert the slide and slide it fully in and out a few times. Insert only one\nside of the slide in and rotate the slide while moving it in and out. Press\ndown the appropriate valve the entire time during this process.\n5.  Push the slide all the way in and use a paper towel to wipe off any extra\ngrease located where the immovable and movable parts of the slide meet.\n6.  Repeat this process for all slides as needed.\n•  This process should be done every month or so.\nValve Maintenance\nIf consistently played on, a tuba should have no “sticky valves” for a few weeks.\n•  On the other hand, a tuba that is not played on for 2-3 days in a row the valve can\nbegin to stick.\n•  To re-oil the valves:\n1.  Begin twisting from the top valve cap until the cap comes off of the valve\ncasing.\n2.  Holding the valve by the finger button, completely remove the valve\nwithout twisting or rotating it inside the casing.\n3.  With some cheesecloth, wipe down any old oil from the piston.\n4.  Apply a healthy coat of oil on the whole piston, but do not intentionally\napply any oil inside the ports as it will simply go to waste once air is\nblown through the horn.\n5.  Take a look inside the valve casing:\n(cid:2)  There should be two notches on the sides of the valve casing; this\nis where the guides on the valve will be placed.\n(cid:2)  One notch should be slightly bigger/different from the other one.\nBe sure to align the correct guide with the correct slot.\n6.  Carefully insert the valve, without twisting or rotating it, inside the\nappropriate valve casing.\n7.  Repeat for any other “sticky” valves.\nTUBA METHOD BOOKS\nEssential Elements 2000\nMSRP $8.99\n@ wwbw.com\nStandard of Excellence\nMSRP $6.95\nBest in Class\nMSRP $5.45\nAccent on Achievement\nMSRP $7.95\nSUPPLEMENTAL TUBA BOOKS\n43 Bel Canto Studies by\nCarl Fischer arr. by Joannes\nRochut\nMSRP $23.76\n@ jwpepper.com\nUsed for lyrical playing\nand musical phrasing for\nhigh school students\nContains etudes that may\nbe used for TMEA All-\nState tuba music\nAdvanced Method for Tuba\nby Rubank\nMSRP $7.99\n@ hallleonard.com\nA more advanced book\nwith etudes and scales\nTechnical Studies for Bass\nClef Instruments by Clarke-\nGordon\nMSRP $29.00\nGood technique-building\nexercises for all ages and\nlevels of playing\nSixty Selected Studies for\nTrombone by Kopprasch\nMSRP $20.55\nUsed for trombone players\nand adopted by tuba\nteachers and players, this\nbook contains many\ndifferent techniques and\nincorporates different clefs\nthroughout the book\n78 Studies by Boris\nGrigoriev\nMSRP $32.05 @\njwpepper.com\nEncompasses an essential\ncollection of studies and\netudes for advanced\nplayers.\nComplete Method for Tuba\nby John Baptiste Arban\nMSRP $56.95\nScales, arpeggios,\nintervals, multiple\ntonguing exercises, duets,\nand technical solos\n70 Studies by Vladislav\nBlazhevich MSRP $18.10\n@\nwww.sheetmusicplus.com\nTUBA CASES, IDENTIFICATION OF PARTS\nAND REMOVING IT FROM ITS CASE\nGeneral Information About All Brass Cases\n•  Most cases have distinguishing marks somewhere on the case.  Identify these\nmarks, and their relationship to the top and bottom of the case.  Most cases have\nthe handles placed on the bottom section of each case.  Check to make sure.\n•  Place all tuba cases on the floor in front of the student.\n•  Be sure the student understands where and which direction each part of the\ninstrument belongs in the case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts\nfrom the case.  Make sure the student waits for each instruction before performing\nthe task.  Be sure the parts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse\norder they were removed.\n•  The tuba should be removed first, followed by the mouthpiece.  When putting\ninstrument back, the order is reversed – mouthpiece first, followed by the tuba.\n•  All instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure\nexplicitly every time.\n•  Never leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up, but\nthis is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.  Check\neach opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to your\nstudents.\n•  Cases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom\nsetup for each student’s case.  If using an ensemble room for the class, the cases\nmay be opened in the hall.  The empty case will remain closed and latched in the\nhall during class.\n•  When instruments are in their cases, do not allow students to sit on their cases AT\nANY TIME because the lead pipe and/or bell will get bent.\nPARTS OF THE TUBA\nBell\nLeadpipe\nMouthpiece\nValves\nTuning Slide\nValve Tuning\nSlides\nWater Key\nTUBA INSTRUMENT/BODY RATIO AND\nHAND POSITION\nInstrument/Body Ratio/Instrument Carriage\n•  Assuming that the student is either sitting with correct posture, instruct them to pick\nup the body of the tuba with both arms and simply move it into position on their laps.\nAs students are doing this, have them notice how it affects the balance of the body.\nEventually, the body should feel as balanced with or without the instrument in hand.\n•  Make sure students bring instruments to them… and not them to the instruments.\nWhen done incorrectly, their body collapses and their air is obstructed.\n•  Shelf liner can be placed on the right leg…or draped across both legs…to help\nestablish correct posture and positioning of the instrument.\n•  Depending on the size of the student and the space they have to work with, a tuba\nstand could be used.  It is important that when using a tuba stand, students are not\ncontorting their bodies or doing anything abnormal.\n•  Shoulders should be straight across when facing the director and it should feel the\nsame way when doing breathing exercises  (do not twist or shift the upper body out of\nthe breathing position)\n•  The tuba should not be slanted in a manner in which moves the students’ head from\nits natural position.\n•  Angles of mouthpieces should be slightly lower than level.\nHand Position\n1.  The most natural shape of everyone’s hands forms a flat “C”.\n2.  All hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall behind the\nwrist.\n3.  There should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the tuba.\n4.  The inside of the arms must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding\nthe tuba correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\n5.  Elbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be\nhampered.\n6.  Place both the left and the right hand in their correct position.  Remember the left\nhand does not “grip” the instrument.  No tension should be felt in this hand when\nholding the instrument.\n7.  The left hand should not contain any tension, as it holds the majority of the weight of\nthe instrument.  The palm of the left hand should be placed naturally across the body\nof the tuba (similar to holding a baby).\n8.  The thumb must never bend in any direction!  The index, middle, ring finger, and\npinky are curved and the fleshy part of the fingertips are placed on the pearls of the\nvalve caps (for piston valves), and on the largest part of the rotary (for rotary valves).\nThe fleshy part of the fingertips should never lose contact with these specific areas.\n9.  Right hand fingers should have curvature; the pads of the fingers should not extend\npast the pearls (or too far down any given rotary valve), which incorrectly results\nstudents playing with flat fingers.\n10. Students with fourth valves must move their pinky (NOT third finger) in the same\nmanner that they move their other valves.  Students will have to build finger strength\nand dexterity once starting to play an instrument with four valves.\n11. Though not a part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling\nthe instrument toward the student’s face.  Instruct students to keep their elbows soft\nwhile playing the tuba.\n12. The palms of both hands should feel soft.  Regardless of whether piston or rotary\nvalves are used, the palm of the right hand should never touch the instrument.\n13. The student should understand that finger movement is aided by the soft tissue of the\npalm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand.\nSpecific Information Regarding Piston Valves\n1. Piston valves are approached basically the same as trumpet.\n2. The right hand thumb and 1st finger should point in same direction when playing top\naction piston valves.  The thumb should not be wrapped around the valve\ncasing…which results in the palm collapsing into the cross brace.\n3. The right hand thumb is placed in its natural position with the side/very tip of the\nright hand thumb being the only thing that touches the bottom of the cross brace.\n4. If the student’s right hand is in the correct position, the teacher should be able to\nclearly see a “circular” opening between the right hand and the instrument.\nSpecific Information Regarding Rotary Valves\n1.  Rotary valves are basically approached the same as French horn.\n2.  The right hand thumb and 1st finger should point in the same direction when playing\nrotary valves.  The thumb should be placed naturally into the thumb ring without any\ntension in the hand.\n3.  The palm should not collapse into the body of the instrument.\nTUBA FACE/EMBOUCHURE\n•  Each student should use their own “safe/unbreakable” mirror—both in the\nclassroom and at home.\nUsing the mirror, have each student notice how natural their face looks.  They\nwill have to later remember and memorize how it looks and feels.\n•  The head must be balanced on the shoulders in a comfortable position—not too\nfar forward and not too far backward.\n•  The eyes should be soft and natural, and the “sight line” should be exactly level.\nThe distance between eyebrows should not change as air goes in and out of the\nbody.\n•  Look for natural creases in the face, and allow any that are naturally present to\nexist while playing.  No other creases are allowed.\n•  The corners should move in toward the canine/eye teeth.  The corners should\nnever look or feel pulled back.\n•  The corners can move down from the natural position as the student progresses\nbut they can never move up.\n•  The texture of both the upper and lower lip should be very soft and relaxed.\n•  There should be natural space between the inside of the lips and the gums and\nteeth.  This space should not change or feel different when the lips vibrate inside\nthe cup of the mouthpiece.\n•  The back teeth are slightly apart and should feel the same as when the student is\nreading, watching television, etc.  The teeth should not be pressed into each other\nwhen doing these other activities.\n•  Brass instrument embouchures are formed with a natural overbite.  A student with\nan underbite should be steered away from brass instrument.\n•  The thickness of a student’s lips should correspond to the size of the cup of the\nmouthpiece for the chosen instrument.  Students with a very full top or bottom lip\nshould be steered towards low brass instruments rather than trumpet.\n•  The bottom of the front of the tongue should lie in the soft tissue area which is\nlocated in the front of the mouth just behind the ridge of the bottom gum.\n•  Remember that when playing the tuba, cheeks will only “puff out” if the air\nis not freely going into the instrument.\n•  Assuming that the above has been achieved, the embouchure will be formed with\nspecial attention to the following:\n1.  The mouthpiece must be placed in the middle of the mouth—up and\ndown as well as side to side.\n2.  The corners are in their natural position and should be set against the\ncanine/eye teeth.\n3.  The lips must be allowed to freely vibrate in response to the airstream\nrather than made to “buzz” in front of the airstream.\n4.  The lips must feel natural so that air can freely move past them—they\nmust not be pulled back against the teeth or blown away from the teeth\nand gums.\n5.  The students should remember that the mouthpiece “gathers” the air—\nnot the lips.\n6.  There must never be more energy placed against the upper lip than the\nlower lip; hence the instrument will angle slightly downwards.\nTUBA ARTICULATION\n•  The tongue moves in the same manner when articulating a brass instrument as it\ndoes  when  you  speak.    The  tongue  moves  up  and  down—not  back  and  forth—\nboth when speaking and when articulation on an instrument.\n•  The purpose of the tongue is to release the air which causes the lips to vibrate and\ncreates  the  sound.    The  tongue’s  release  of  the  air  simply  defines  the\nbeginning/start of the vibration/sound.\n•  Articulation  is  used  to  define  the  vibrations  necessary  to  create  musical  rhythm,\nstyle  and  movement--to  contrast  the  use  of  slurring  (which  also  creates  similar\nmusical entities).\n•  The students should think that the tongue “articulates” the sound created by the\nairstream.  If the student is taught to create the sound correctly, articulation will\nbe an easy transition.\na.  sound occurs when the air moves past the naturally vibrating lips\nb.  articulate the sound that is already present\nc.  teach students to articulate at the moment the sound begins\n•  Without the instrument or mouthpiece, use the following procedure:\n1.   Say the word “DOG”.\n2.  Sing the syllable “DAH”.\n3.  Once these are mastered, have the student use the mouthpiece and\ninstrument and reproduce the “DAH” syllable in their brain to create\nan articulated sound.\n4.  The tongue should feel the same when saying, singing and playing the\nmouthpiece and instrument.\n5.  The tongue should touch the enamel of the upper teeth directly below\nthe gum line—in the same spot with the same strength every time.\n6.  Use the syllable “DAH” because it creates smoother and more easily\ncontrolled air as opposed to the “TAH” syllable.\n7.  After each “articulation”, the tongue must immediately fall down into\nits natural “at rest” position.\n8.  The tongue will be naturally soft at all times, but can touch the teeth\nwith different strengths.\n9.  The tongue will be in its “down position” 98% of the time when\narticulating correctly.\n•  Have the student start their sound with the air.\n•  Using the information about the basics of articulation, have the student articulate\nas fast as they can with no limitations of numbers, worries about evenness of\narticulation, etc.  Simply get them used to articulating!\n•  Have the student then use the “ta-day” syllable to practice using the tongue in an\norganized manner.\n•  Have the student then articulate “on command.”  The student will start their\nsound, and articulate when you snap your fingers to practice gaining more control\nof the tongue.\n•  Once the student understands pulse and the foot pat, have the student articulate\nexactly when the toe of the foot touches the floor.\n•  Have the student articulate with the down and up position of the foot.\n•  Proceed to written rhythms as they begin to read music.\nAlways practice this entire routine.  The student must always go through the\nentire process, so he will not lose the ability to move his tongue at various speeds\nand in a structured manner.\nTUBA FLEXIBILITY AND RANGE\nEXTENSION\n•  Brass playing is based upon flexibility.\n•  There are two types of flexibility: flexibility within the instrument and flexibility\nwithin the note.\n•  Students eventually need to be flexible through each of the harmonic series in\norder to move up and down within the range of the instrument.\n•  Once the student can reproduce at will a given pitch, the teacher must decide\nwhether flexibility up or down is needed first.\n•  Flexibility is controlled by air direction and the isometrics created by the corners\nand canine/eye teeth.  The head must always stay in its natural, balanced position\nat all times.  The angle of the instrument must not change at any time.\n•  Students must learn to angle the air in the cup of the mouthpiece without changing\nthe position of the lips and/or the relationship of the upper and lower teeth.\n•  Flexibility is also enhanced by vowel sounds used in various registers.  These\nsounds can be “ah” for the middle register….”ee” for the upper register….and\n“oh” for the lower register.  Have students practice saying these vowel sounds\nwith vocalization on appropriate lower, middle and higher sounds.\n•  The speed of the air and the shape of the vowel guide flexibility.  The tongue\nassists the air speed similar to the way one’s thumb assists the water speed from a\nhose.  The tongue relaxes when descending into the lower register and arches\nwhen ascending into the upper register.\n•  Bring to the students’ attention that the shape of the tongue changes dramatically\nfrom vowel sound to vowel sound.  All students should be aware that vowel\nsounds are the middles of words that they speak every day.  Practice saying words\nthat use the required vowel sounds (i.e.  bow, ball, beep).\n•  Range is developed through flexibility.  It is more important to create a resonant\nsound while practicing flexibility than to create wider intervals.  The student can\nenhance their range by making more resonant sounds in the middle register before\ntrying to extend higher or lower.\n•  While it is important to create resonant sounds in the register students can play in,\nit is important for students to occasionally try exploring both the upper and lower\nrange they struggle to make a good sound in.  This should be practiced perhaps\ntwice a week.\n•  Make sure students understand the texture of the lips have nothing to do with\nrange. For example, students should never be told to “tighten” their lips in order\nto play in the higher register.\nTUBA COMPENSATING SYSTEM\n•  A compensating system is commonly found on more intermediate and advanced\ntubas; this system is not typically used on beginner instruments.\n•  A compensating tuba works exactly like a compensating euphonium, just an\noctave lower.\n•  The compensating system works like the F-attachment on trombone.  When 4th\nvalve is depressed, the instrument is pitched in the key of F.\n•  The compensating system allows for the possibility to play a full chromatic scale\nbetween the 1st and 2nd partials (low B-flat – low E specifically)\n•  With all valves depressed on a compensating Bb tuba (1-2-3-4), the instrument\nwill sound a low B-natural.  That same valve combination on a non-compensating\ntuba will only produce a low C.  This makes the low B-natural a non-existent note\non a non-compensating horn.\n•  When using a compensating-style instrument, one has the advantage of being able\nto play lower octaves using conventional fingerings and pressing down 4th valve\n(for example, below the staff D-flat would be played 2-3).  To play the octave\nbelow, one would depress the 2-3-valve combination and add 4th valve.  This\nwould be a different fingering on a non-compensating tuba (1-3-4)\n•  Having a compensating tuba is extremely beneficial in extending the lower range\nchromatically.\n•  1-3 and 1-2-3 valve combinations can be played 4 and 2-4, respectively, to help\nwith resonance, clarity, and tuning difficulties.\n•  Most 4th valves will be located directly next to the 3rd valve, and is to be played\nwith the right hand pinky only.\n•  Some compensating tubas will have a 5th valve that is activated with the right\nhand thumb or left hand index finger. This 5th valve can either be a rotary valve or\na trigger.\n•  Not all 4 valve instruments are compensating; you must look behind the valves to\nsee if the instrument includes extra tubing that goes through the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd\nvalves.\nTUBA GENERAL TUNING TENDENCIES\nThe Overtone Series\n•  There are 7 possible combinations of fingerings:\n(cid:2)  Open\n(cid:2)  2\n(cid:2)  1\n(cid:2)  1-2 (3rd valve alone is about the same length)\n(cid:2)  2-3\n(cid:2)  1-3 (4)\n(cid:2)  1-2-3 (2-4)\n•  Each valve combination plays a series of slotted notes. Displayed below are all\nthe possible notes that can be played without pressing any valves down (open).\n•  The order of valve combinations listed above will lower every note on the staff by\na half-step.  The lowest note on the 2nd valve combination would be an A…the 1st\nvalve combination would be an Ab, etc.\n•  Because each overtone series is in tune with itself, switching between all 7 will\ncause tuning tendencies.\n•  To overcome a tuning tendency, the following can be done:\n1.  Valve slide adjustment\n2.  Vowel shape/air direction adjustment\n3.  Alternate fingering\n•  Before going over which adjustment should be used when, it is important to go\nover the specific tuning tendencies."

    "text": "FRENCH HORN – ADVANCED TECHNIQUES FOR FRENCH HORN\nThere are numerous techniques beyond range, flexibility, articulation, and other fundamentals that are vital to playing literature for more mature horn players, such as a fair amount of works for high school band.\nRight Hand Technique\nAfter the beginner year, the right hand player must be placed into the bell for proper tone quality and tuning.\nTo create the create the correct right hand shape:\nTake the right hand and hold it out like shaking a person’s hand.\nBring all the fingers together so they are touching each other then let the thumb rest on top of the index finger.\nKeeping a relaxed hand, put this right hand into the bell so that the knuckles are touching the far side of the bell and line up to where the bell begins to flare.\nDepending on the teacher’s preference, the index finger can be anywhere from a “12 o’ clock” to a “10 o’ clock” position in the bell.\nThe hand should be straight, while the wrist, elbow and shoulder should be relaxed and free of tension.\nThe wrist can be bent or straight depending on the needs of the student.\nThe hand must not be cupped while in the bell, as this will produce a muffled sound.\nIndividual students will need to adjust how far in the hand must be and how much to turn their hand according to body size, tuning, and tone quality.\nA noticeably sharp, bright sound means that the hand is too far out.\nA noticeably flat, muffled sound means that the hand is too far in.\nA muffled sound may also mean that the hand is too cupped.\nTransposition\nTransposition is the process involved while playing a horn part written for a horn not in the key of F (ex. Horn in C, Dvorak Symphony No. 9, mvt.1, Horns 3 and 4).\nThe general rule is: C’s a C, sounds the key. This means that a written C on any part will sound the key of the instrument playing that part.\nEx. A written C for clarinet in A sounds an A on the piano and other non-transposing instruments.\nRemember, the transposition is from the printed “Horn in _” key to Horn in F.\nA little trick to find the transposition interval is to find the closest interval between Horn in F and the printed horn key. This is the interval and direction for the transposition.\nEx. The music has printed “Horn in A.” The interval between Horn in F and Horn in A is an ascending major third, so one would play a major third up from the printed notes.\nThe most common keys or transpositions are Horn in E and Horn in Eb.\nTo transpose Horn in E, play a half-step lower than printed.\nEx. A written 3rd line B-natural would be played as a Bb/A#.\nTo transpose Horn in Eb, play a whole-step lower than written.\nEx. A written 5th line F would be played as a(n) Eb/D#.\nAs exercises, have students transpose short segments of a familiar slow piece at first. The familiarity will allow them to use their ear to help determine if their transposition is correct.\nThen, lengthen the selection of pieces and include faster pieces. After this, include pieces in various meters and with accidentals.\nA common mistake when transposing is forgetting accidentals and key signatures. These must be accounted for when transposing a part.\nDo not allow students to write in transposed note names. This skill is sight-transposing, and this crutch may hinder students’ progress in learning to properly transpose.\nThis is a skill that requires dedication, persistence, and drill. A little daily practice…even 2 minutes…will improve the skill.\nMuted Horn\nMuted horn is called for by a variety of directions, but always involved putting a straight mute into the bell of the horn.\nThere is no hand alternative to this technique, so a string or other mechanism for holding the mute by hanging at the wrist is vital for quick mute changes.\nMusical directions for muted horn:\n“Mute” vs. “Open”\nEnglish pieces/contemporary pieces\n“Mute” denotes a section to be played with the mute in.\n“Open” denotes a section to be played with the mute out.\nMit Dampfer vs. ohne Dampfer\nGerman composers\nMit Dampfer means “with dampener” or with the mute in.\nOhne Dampfer means “without dampener” or with the mute out.\nCon sordino vs. senza sordino\nCon sordino denotes to play with the mute in.\nSenza sordino denotes to play with the mute out.\nAs very common directions, these can be abbreviated to con sord. and senza sord.\nFor all of these directions, they each denote a section of music to played accordingly, like tempo or style directions.\nTo play effectively, the player must put more air into their sound and horn, regardless of the dynamic. At all dynamics above piano, there must be a slight buzz to the sound.\nStopped Horn\nStopped horn, called for via various directions in the part, is accomplished in one of two ways:\nMuting the horn with a stop mute\nThis is simple: stick the stop mute in the bell of the horn like a straight mute, ensuring that the hole is completely sealed. The seal is open if there is an airy sound or leak.\nThis is easier to produce the desired sound, especially in the lower register.\nIt takes some time to move the mute in and out of the horn, so a string should be tied to the mute.\nIf the mute change is too fast in the music, the player must hand mute the horn.\nMuting the horn by fully closing the bell bore with the hand\nTo hand-mute the horn, simply collapse the wrist of the right hand to seal the opposite wall as the fingers. Rotate or adjust the fingers or wrist to completely seal the horn.\nAgain, an airy, muffled or diffuse (lacking in support) sound reveals an incomplete seal in the hand.\nThis is the technique favored by professionals, and it does not require an additional mute.\nThis is the best stopped horn technique for quick mute changes.\nIn both cases, the player must blow a noticeably larger amount of air – like playing a normal forte or fortissimo – such that the player produces a buzzy or brassy sound.\nThis is more difficult as one descends the range of the horn – it is difficult just below the staff, and quite difficult near low C (2nd space C in bass clef).\nIn both cases, the section to be stopped must be transposed like Horn in E – played a half-step lower than written, on the F side.\nFor a few notes, this transposition will not produce the correct note or play close to “in-tune.” On these notes (which are different on each horn), experiment to find a fingering which will play the note “in-tune.”\nRemember, play a half-step lower on the F side, even above 2nd line G.\nMusic directions for stopped horn:\n(+) = stopped, (o) = open\nThis is a common direction in newer music and simple to remember.\nIn this system, there are usually +’s over each note to be stopped, and a single “o” to end the stopped horn direction.\nGestopft vs. Offen\nGestopft denotes stopped\nOffen denotes open\nFor these directions, the word will be printed above the beginning of the section to be stopped or opened.\nUntil the next gestopft or offen direction, the music is played according to the last direction given.\nThis is the common system used by German composers, such as Wagner and Mahler.\nBouché cuivré vs. Ouvert\nBouché cuivré denotes stopped horn.\nIt may sometimes be denoted as just cuivré (closed) or, mistakenly, as bouché (brassy). If the music only notes bouché, check previous recordings to see if the direction is for stopped horn or just a loud, brassy sound.\nOuvert or a similar-looking word denotes open.\nThis system works the same as the German system for stopped horn directions.\nReading Bass Clef\nAll French horn players should be proficient in reading both treble and bass clef, particularly 2nd and 4th horn players.\nOlder pieces (generally those written before 1880-1900) that are not edited to modern notation will have bass clef horn parts written an octave lower than played.\nIf it appears absurdly low in the bass clef, the part is probably meant to be transposed up.\nThe transposition is to play the part an octave higher than written.\nFor example: A C two lines below the bass clef would be played as a 2nd space C in the bass clef.\nTo practice this bass clef transposition skill, simply assign horn players to transpose tuba parts at first; then, give them real examples of 4th horn parts from any Classical or Romantic Era symphony to transpose.\nLike other transpositions, consistent practice will teach this skill in a matter of weeks.\nOther Techniques\nLip Trills\nThis is a rapid alteration between two adjacent notes on the harmonic series.\nThis is called for on the harmonics no further than a whole-step apart.\nEssentially, it is a fast series of lip slurs.\nThe key to the technique is an ease of air flow between the two alternating notes: the constant air makes the trill, along with a slight motion of the back of the tongue.\nOnce a rapid speed is desired, a slight oscillation of the jaw will aid the clarity of the lip trill.\nRemember, the lip trill is an alternation between two notes a whole step apart. The lips should not noticeably move between the two notes.\nThe lip trill, like transposition, requires consistent and diligent practice. Additionally, it requires technical facility and good flexibility to achieve.\nThe lip trill is called for by the normal trill directions, and it is distinguished from the half-step trill by the key of the piece. If the trill is a half-step trill, it is a valve trill. If it is a whole-step trill, it is a lip trill.\nConsult professional recordings of any Mozart horn concerto to hear a good lip trill.\nEcho/shadow horn\nPrimarily a French direction, this is the technique of nearly fully closing the hand in the bell and transposing up a half-step.\nThe desired sound is muffled and distant.\nTypically denoted by sons d’echo\nFor example: Horn I in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice by Paul Dukas\nHand tuning\nThis involves the fine tuning of pitch using the right hand.\nYounger students do not have consistent pitch, so this technique is only applicable to students with stable pitch – whether in-tune or not.\nTo sharpen the pitch:\nThe hand can be pulled out of the bell.\nThe wrist can be bent away from the player.\nThe arm can be moved away from the player.\nTo flatten the pitch:\nThe hand can be pushed into the bell.\nThe wrist can be bent toward the player.\nThe arm can be moved toward the player.\nThis phenomenon occurs because moving the hand adjusts the “length” of the French horn.\nClosing the hand produces a longer surface for sound to travel, thus lengthening the horn and lowering the pitch.\nOpening the hand produces a shorter surface for sound to travel, thus shortening the horn and raising the pitch.\nThese adjustments are no larger than about a quarter tone either direction, so the hand is useful only for small adjustments of pitch."

    "text": "FRENCH HORN MOUTHPIECES\nThere are several parts to the French horn mouthpiece:\nRim – the contact point for the lips. This can come in various contours and grips.\nFlatter rim = better flexibility, rounder rim = better endurance\nGrip/bite – inside edge of rim. Round = better for thin lips, sharp = better for think lips to ‘grip’ the mouthpiece\nCup diameter – the measurement of the diameter of the inside of the rim.\nSizes are generally between 16.5 and 18.5mm\nThe size determines how much of the lips can “fit” into the cup.\nSmaller = better for thinner lips, Larger = better for thick lips\nCup shape/depth\nTwo sizes of cups – bowl-shaped and funnel-shaped.\nBowl-shaped cups produce a warmer, rounder sound\nFunnel-shaped cups produce a more direct, ringing sound\nShallow cups have faster response, better high range flexibility, and more focused sound.\nDeeper cups have slower response, better low range flexibility, and a broader sound.\nBore/backbore\nThe bore is the hole at the end of the cup\nSize of the bore determines how free-flowing or resistant the mouthpiece is. Smaller = more resistance, Larger = less resistance\nResistance helps with breath control, high range, and accuracy up to a point.\nThe backbore is the gradual taper to the bore.\nA narrow, straight contour makes for less pitch flexibility and more resistant loud playing, but has a more focused tone.\nA rounded contour makes for more pitch flexibility and has less resistance at loud dynamics and a darker, broader tone\nPlating – the metal the mouthpiece is made of.\nThe mouthpiece usually comes in nickel, silver, or gold, but there is not much of a technical difference.\nIf a player has a metal allergy, rims can be made out of plastic such as Delrin or Lexan.\nRECOMMENDED\nGenerally, beginners will have thinner, smaller lips, so smaller rims, smaller inner cup diameters, moderate cup shape and depth, moderate bore size and a moderate backbore contour will allow them sufficient ease of playing and flexibility.\nBrand: Yamaha\nModel: 30C4\nPricing: MSRP $34.99 @ wwbw.com\nDescription:\nEasy response\nGood balance between endurance and flexibility\n(moderate rim contour)\nAbout halfway point between dark and bright tone qualities\nBrand: Schilke\nModel: 30 Silver\nPricing: MSRP $56.00 @ wwbw.com\nProduces darker tone sooner\nBrand: Stork\nModel: C8\nPricing: MSRP $60.99 @ wwbw.com\nMore direct sound (straighter cup shape)\nGood flexibility (flatter rim)\nBrand: Holton\nModel: MDC (Medium-Deep Cup)\nPricing: MSRP $59.00 @ wwbw.com\nEasy response across the entire range\nSmall diameter for smaller lips\nPARTS OF THE FRENCH HORN MOUTHPIECE"

    "text": "FRENCH HORN MAINTENANCE\nMouthpiece Maintenance\nOver time, grime and other dirty objects build up in the mouthpiece.\nTo clean the mouthpiece:\nTake a mouthpiece brush and run it through the mouthpiece under warm water in the sink.\nThe brush will not go all the way through, so insert the brush through both ends to fully clean each end.\nSoap is not necessary, but it does not hurt the mouthpiece to use it. The same goes for mouthwash. If these are used, simply rinse the mouthpiece thoroughly afterwards and let it air dry so that the alcohol evaporates.\nThis process should be done every week to two weeks.\nSlide Maintenance\nThe insides of the slides and various tubes build up grime, various dirt particles, and germs, so the slides must be snaked at least once a month.\nTo snake a horn:\nTake out the appropriate slide, pressing down the appropriate valve while taking it out, and place the slide on a towel or soft surface.\nRun water through the unattached slide, preferably in the opposite direction of air flow.\nIn the case of the main tuning slide and the lead pipe, also run water through the lead pipe – starting on the end with the tuning slide, not the end with the mouthpiece receiver.\nTake the snake and run it through the slide which was taken out, preferably in the opposite direction of air flow.\nRepeat the above step on the immovable part of the slide attached to the rotor. Be careful to not jam the snake against the rotor.\nRepeat the above two steps with all slides, including the main tuning slide, the F tuning slide and the Bb tuning slide.\nApply slide grease as necessary according to the below steps.\nThere are numerous slides on the French horn. Each of these must be well-lubricated with slide grease. Refer to the “Maintenance Kit” handout for pictures of slide greases.\nTo apply the grease:\nTake out the slide to be greased, pressing down the appropriate valve.\nWith a paper towel, wipe off the slide to clean the grease and any grime on the slide.\nIf the grease is a liquid, squeeze the bottle and apply a line of grease down two sides of the slide. If the grease is more of a cream, use the index finger to apply the grease along most of the length of the slide.\nDo not apply too much grease, as the slides can become too lubricated and fall out.\nRe-insert the slide and slide it fully in and out a few times. Insert only one side of the slide in and rotate the slide while moving it in and out. Press down the appropriate valve the entire time during this process.\nPush the slide all the way in and use a paper towel to wipe off any extra grease located where the immovable and movable parts of the slide meet.\nRepeat this process for all slides as needed – even fake tuning slides.\nThis process should be done every month or so.\nValve Maintenance\nWith a Holton French horn, you will have to constantly apply oil to the valves.\nOil all the moving parts.  Oil is like most wonderful things…you cannot have too much!\nPut oil on the springs, under the valve cap, and inside the slides to keep the oil from mixing with slide grease and slowing down the valve.  Then move the slide in and out while pressing on the corresponding valve. Make sure that your students routinely depress the keys when emptying their slides.\nThere are two types of rotary oil – rotor oil and rotor spindle/bearing oil. Rotor oil looks like normal valve oil, whereas spindle oil has a “needle-looking” thing. Rotor oil goes in the slides to lubricate the outside of the rotor casing. Spindle/bearing oil goes under the valve caps, such that the raised portion is covered in a small dome of oil. It also goes on the underside, inside of a crevice between the middle vertical screw and the bumpers. The spindle/bearing oil lubricates the interior mechanism of the rotor. It is wise to not mix these up, as the two oils have different thicknesses (and rotors do not like it when they have the wrong oil).\nOn some horns, there are strings connecting the components of the rotary valves. These strings will break on occasion, and they can be an ordeal to tie – especially if the student or director is inexperienced. Consult this diagram for a string-tying guide:"

    "text": "FRENCH HORN –\nEMPTYING THE FRENCH HORN\nEmptying the horn can be an ordeal, especially if the water is somewhere between slides; however, proper techniques and skill with emptying the horn using the appropriate slides will purge 90% of the water.\nIt is actually 95-99% condensation and 1-5% spit that produces the gurgling sounds; therefore, “spit” covering the floor under the horn section is mostly water, not disgusting saliva.\nWhenever emptying the horn, the basic technique (aside from using a dedicated spit valve, which some instruments may not have) is taking a particular slide off of the horn and turning the horn such that the water falls out.\nTo make more water come out, always turn the horn so that the water moves vertically. This means that the slide to be emptied must point perpendicular to the ground.\nIn the case of the main tuning slide (the one attached to the leadpipe) and the F tuning slide, simply take the slide off and dump the water.\nFor all other slides, including the Bb tuning slide (if the horn has a Bb tuning slide), the corresponding valve(s) must be depressed to properly empty the horn.\nConsult the diagram on the next page for valves and corresponding slides.\nFailure to properly depress the valves while emptying water does negatively affect the sealing on the rotors, and will slowly make the rotors move slower.\nTricks for finding water:\nHold down each valve and blow air through the horn. Remember to blow through the valves on the Bb side as well. Any audible gurgle means there is water in that particular slide.\nA gurgle without any valves depressed means that the water could be in:\nthe main tuning slide\nthe “fake” tuning slide/water slide\nthe F tuning slide\nthe area after all of the valves and before the bell\nTo empty this section, fully turn the horn clockwise – then point the bell semi-vertically such that water can fall to the ground.\nTo catch any “pesky” water:\nTurn the horn so that the valves are pointed vertically up and the keys are on the lower side.\nWiggle all the keys for a few seconds, including the trigger.\nAfter this, depress the trigger and the 3rd valve.\nTilt the horn 180° so that the keys are up and the slides are vertical, with the holes pointed down.\nTake out the Bb side 3rd valve.\nWatch as water magically falls out of the horn.\nFrench Horn Diagram"

Some cases may not open such that both sides are on the floor. For these cases, one side will stay up and possibly fall on the horn while removing it from the case.\nWhen possible, remove the French horn by gripping the main pipe running between all the valves and slides. This is the sturdiest part of the instrument. Do not grip the horn by the bell, as the bell contains some of the thinner layers of metal on the instrument."

    "text": "INSTRUMENTS OF THE FRENCH HORN FAMILY\nSingle Horn\nPitched either in F or Bb (this should be obvious when purchasing the horn)\nIn either case, the player will read music for Horn in F.\nThe single horn will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch.\nThis horn is a common starter horn due to its light weight, especially for smaller students.\nThe single F horn will have a smoother sounding low register, but the high register will have many tuning, accuracy and general tone issues.\nTuning notes for the single F horn are written middle C and below the staff B, Bb, A, and Ab.\nThe single Bb horn has a quicker response and an easier, more in-tune and better sounding high register.\nTuning notes for the single Bb horn are written 1st space F, 2nd line E and Eb and below the staff D and Db.\nAs these instruments are typically starter instruments. The student will need to move to a double horn during the later middle school/early high school years.\nDouble Horn\nPitched in both F and Bb\nFor most American double horns, the top set of slides is the F side while the bottom set of slides is the Bb side.\nTo use the Bb side, depress the thumb trigger.\nThe player will read music for Horn in F.\nThe descant horn will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch.\nTuning notes for the double horn include tuning notes for both sides:\nTuning notes for the F side are written middle C and below the staff B, Bb, A and Ab.\nTuning notes for the Bb side are written 1st space F, 2nd line E and Eb and below the staff D and Db.\nThe double horn is the typical instrument of choice from middle school to the professional level. The combination of the secure high range of the Bb side and the smooth low range of the F side meets most of the needs of the horn player well.\nDescant Horn\nPitched in Bb and either high F or high Eb.\nLike the double horn, the top set of slides is the Bb side while the bottom set of slides is either the high F or high Eb side.\nLike the double horn, depress the trigger to use the high F or high Eb side.\nTuning notes for the descant horn include tuning notes for each of the sides:\nTuning for the high F side are written 3rd space C, 3rd line B and Bb and 2nd line A and Ab.\nTuning notes for the high Eb side are written 3rd line Bb, 2nd space A and Ab and 2nd line G and Gb.\nThe descant horn is used to assist a professional horn player who is required to play in the high register.\nThe high F or high Eb side provides a more secure high register than the Bb side.\nThe descant horn is made for professional assistance, not to compensate for technical deficiencies in younger players. As such, this horn should not be used at the secondary level.\nTriple Horn\nPitched in F, Bb and either high F or high Eb.\nJust as the double horn, the top set of slides is the F side, the middle set is the Bb side, and the bottom set is either high F or high Eb.\nLike the double horn, depress either the top trigger for the Bb side or the bottom trigger for the high F or high Eb side.\nThe triple horn will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch.\nTuning notes for the triple horn include tuning notes for each of the three sides:\nTuning notes for the high F side are written 3rd space C, 3rd line B and Bb and 2nd line A and Ab.\nThe triple horn is essentially a double horn with a descant side. Due to specific compensations in horn construction, each of the sides will not sound as resonant as on double horns with the particular sides.\nThe triple horn provides a more secure high register on the high F or high Eb side while maintaining the flexibility of range in the other two sides.\nThe triple horn, like the descant horn, is made to assist professional players, not to compensate for technical deficiencies in younger players. As such, this horn should not be used at the secondary level.\nVienna Horn\nThe Vienna horn comes with a crook mechanism. As such, the player can play in all twelve chromatic keys, using particular crooks according to particular composer directions or particular keys.\nThe most common crook is the F crook, so the horn is most often pitched in F.\nThe player will read music written for horn in any key. The player must read the music for the particular horn key printed.\nThe most common crook is the F crook, so the player will usually read music for Horn in F.\nAs this horn can play in any key via the crook mechanism, its sounding pitch will vary according to the crook used.\nThe rule for finding the transposition is, “C’s a C, sounds the key.” This means that a printed C in any octave will produce the key of the crook without any valves depressed.\nFor example, a Vienna horn with an A crook would sound a 2nd space A if the printed note was 3rd space C. As such, the transposition for the A crook would be down a minor 3rd from concert pitch.\nThe most common crook is the F crook, so the Vienna horn will sound a perfect 5th lower than concert pitch.\nTuning notes for the Vienna horn will vary according to the crook used.\nThe most common crook is the F crook. Tuning notes for the Vienna horn with an F crook are written middle C and below the staff B, Bb, A and Ab.\nWhile the Vienna horn still uses teardrop keys (like on all other horns), the horn uses the pump valve system. This system is essentially a double-piston valve system, where the pistons are activated with long rods attached to the teardrop keys.\nThis system allows for the characteristic smooth legatos and slurs heard on the Vienna horn.\nThe Vienna horn is only used in Vienna, Austria, most famously in the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.\nThe Vienna horn will not be used at the secondary level.\nMarching Horn\nPitched in Bb\nThe marching horn will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch.\nTuning notes for the marching horn are written 1st space F, 2nd line E and Eb and below the staff D and Db.\nThe marching horn was not necessarily designed to play in tune. Tuning will be a constant issue with this instrument.\nThe marching horn is one of the two marching band versions of French horns. This instrument is used in marching band because the bell faces toward the front rather than behind (as a normal French horn would).\nThe fact that the marching horn is pitched in Bb makes it easier and more accurate to play.\nMellophone\nPitched in high F or high Eb\nThe player will read music for Horn in F or for Horn in Eb.\nThe mellophone will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch if pitched in high F or a major 6th below concert pitch if pitched in high Eb.\nMost marching bands will use mellophones pitch in high F.\nTuning notes the mellophone depend on its pitch.\nTuning notes for a high F and high Eb mellophone are written 3rd space C, 3rd line B and Bb and 2nd line A and Ab.\nFor the high F mellophone, these notes are concert F, E, Eb, D and Db.\nFor the high Eb mellophone, these notes are concert Eb, D, Db, C and B.\nLike the marching horn, the mellophone was not necessarily designed to play in tune. Tuning will be a constant issue with this instrument.\nThe mellophone is the second of the two marching band versions of French horns. This instrument is used in marching band because the bell faces toward the front rather than behind (as a normal French horn would).\nThe fact that the mellophone is pitched in F gives the player a more secure high register.\nRECOMMENDED FRENCH HORN BRANDS\nBeginner:\nBrand: Conn\nModel: 6D\nPricing: MSRP $3299.00 @ wwbw.com\nDescription:\nBrass, more compact and lighter than the Conn 8D\nDurable\nHave a tendency to play below pitch center\nVery acceptable for beginners\nProfessional:\nModel: 8D\nPricing: MSRP $4349.00 - $4559.00 @ wwbw.com\nNickel silver large bore horn-typically darker sound with less defined grooves for the notes\nRequires more air control and more strength to play\nHeavier than other brands\nNot recommended for small beginning students or older students that have bad pitch distinction\nVery durable\nWatch 3rd space C# and 4th line D on this horn.\n3rd space C# will be terribly flat, and so the 3rd valve on the Bb side should barely be pulled out (because G# below and above it will be fine with this valve in, and C# is a pretty common note).\n4th line D is often sharper than the other T12 valve combinations on the horn – sometimes T3 actually puts this horn’s 4th line D in tune.\nBrand: Yamaha\nModel: YHR-667VL\nPricing: MSRP $7636.99 @ wwbw.com\nConsidered a professional horn\nFree blowing\nOpen wrap\nExcellent response and pitch adjustability\nValves and slides are fussy and need to be maintained daily with valve oil.\nDesigned to be played in the US and in Europe.\nPlay above A=440Hz; this is why the slides are so long\nVery thin metal, not durable\nModel: YHR-668NII\nPricing: MSRP $4469.99 @ wwbw.com\nA little heavier than the Yamaha 667\nThin and not durable metal\nHave quick response\nBrand: Holton\nModel: H179 Farkas Series\nPricing: MSRP $4349.00\nNickel silver with bad finish\nValves are mediocre because they are poorly designed.

This can come in various contours and grips.\nFlatter rim = better flexibility, rounder rim = better endurance\nGrip/bite – inside edge of rim. Round = better for thin lips, sharp = better for think lips to ‘grip’ the mouthpiece\nCup diameter – the measurement of the diameter of the inside of the rim.\nSizes are generally between 16.5 and 18.5mm\nThe size determines how much of the lips can “fit” into the cup.\nSmaller = better for thinner lips, Larger = better for thick lips\nCup shape/depth\nTwo sizes of cups – bowl-shaped and funnel-shaped.\nBowl-shaped cups produce a warmer, rounder sound\nFunnel-shaped cups produce a more direct, ringing sound\nShallow cups have faster response, better high range flexibility, and more focused sound.\nDeeper cups have slower response, better low range flexibility, and a broader sound.\nBore/backbore\nThe bore is the hole at the end of the cup\nSize of the bore determines how free-flowing or resistant the mouthpiece is. Smaller = more resistance, Larger = less resistance\nResistance helps with breath control, high range, and accuracy up to a point.\nThe backbore is the gradual taper to the bore.\nA narrow, straight contour makes for less pitch flexibility and more resistant loud playing, but has a more focused tone.\nA rounded contour makes for more pitch flexibility and has less resistance at loud dynamics and a darker, broader tone\nPlating – the metal the mouthpiece is made of.\nThe mouthpiece usually comes in nickel, silver, or gold, but there is not much of a technical difference.\nIf a player has a metal allergy, rims can be made out of plastic such as Delrin or Lexan.\nRECOMMENDED\nGenerally, beginners will have thinner, smaller lips, so smaller rims, smaller inner cup diameters, moderate cup shape and depth, moderate bore size and a moderate backbore contour will allow them sufficient ease of playing and flexibility.\nModel: 30C4\nPricing: MSRP $34.99 @ wwbw.com\nEasy response\nGood balance between endurance and flexibility\n(moderate rim contour)\nAbout halfway point between dark and bright tone qualities\nBrand: Schilke\nModel: 30 Silver\nPricing: MSRP $56.00 @ wwbw.com\nProduces darker tone sooner\nBrand: Stork\nModel: C8\nPricing: MSRP $60.99 @ wwbw.com\nMore direct sound (straighter cup shape)\nGood flexibility (flatter rim)\nModel: MDC (Medium-Deep Cup)\nPricing: MSRP $59.00 @ wwbw.com\nEasy response across the entire range\nSmall diameter for smaller lips\nPARTS OF THE FRENCH HORN MOUTHPIECE\nFRENCH HORN MAINTENANCE\nMouthpiece Maintenance\nOver time, grime and other dirty objects build up in the mouthpiece.\nTo clean the mouthpiece:\nTake a mouthpiece brush and run it through the mouthpiece under warm water in the sink.\nThe brush will not go all the way through, so insert the brush through both ends to fully clean each end.\nSoap is not necessary, but it does not hurt the mouthpiece to use it. The same goes for mouthwash. If these are used, simply rinse the mouthpiece thoroughly afterwards and let it air dry so that the alcohol evaporates.\nThis process should be done every week to two weeks.\nSlide Maintenance\nThe insides of the slides and various tubes build up grime, various dirt particles, and germs, so the slides must be snaked at least once a month.\nTo snake a horn:\nTake out the appropriate slide, pressing down the appropriate valve while taking it out, and place the slide on a towel or soft surface.\nRun water through the unattached slide, preferably in the opposite direction of air flow.\nIn the case of the main tuning slide and the lead pipe, also run water through the lead pipe – starting on the end with the tuning slide, not the end with the mouthpiece receiver.\nTake the snake and run it through the slide which was taken out, preferably in the opposite direction of air flow.\nRepeat the above step on the immovable part of the slide attached to the rotor. Be careful to not jam the snake against the rotor.\nRepeat the above two steps with all slides, including the main tuning slide, the F tuning slide and the Bb tuning slide.\nApply slide grease as necessary according to the below steps.\nThere are numerous slides on the French horn. Each of these must be well-lubricated with slide grease. Refer to the “Maintenance Kit” handout for pictures of slide greases.\nTo apply the grease:\nTake out the slide to be greased, pressing down the appropriate valve.\nWith a paper towel, wipe off the slide to clean the grease and any grime on the slide.\nIf the grease is a liquid, squeeze the bottle and apply a line of grease down two sides of the slide. If the grease is more of a cream, use the index finger to apply the grease along most of the length of the slide.\nDo not apply too much grease, as the slides can become too lubricated and fall out.\nRe-insert the slide and slide it fully in and out a few times. Insert only one side of the slide in and rotate the slide while moving it in and out. Press down the appropriate valve the entire time during this process.\nPush the slide all the way in and use a paper towel to wipe off any extra grease located where the immovable and movable parts of the slide meet.\nRepeat this process for all slides as needed – even fake tuning slides.\nThis process should be done every month or so.\nValve Maintenance\nWith a Holton French horn, you will have to constantly apply oil to the valves.\nOil all the moving parts.  Oil is like most wonderful things…you cannot have too much!\nPut oil on the springs, under the valve cap, and inside the slides to keep the oil from mixing with slide grease and slowing down the valve.  Then move the slide in and out while pressing on the corresponding valve. Make sure that your students routinely depress the keys when emptying their slides.\nThere are two types of rotary oil – rotor oil and rotor spindle/bearing oil. Rotor oil looks like normal valve oil, whereas spindle oil has a “needle-looking” thing. Rotor oil goes in the slides to lubricate the outside of the rotor casing. Spindle/bearing oil goes under the valve caps, such that the raised portion is covered in a small dome of oil. It also goes on the underside, inside of a crevice between the middle vertical screw and the bumpers. The spindle/bearing oil lubricates the interior mechanism of the rotor. It is wise to not mix these up, as the two oils have different thicknesses (and rotors do not like it when they have the wrong oil).\nOn some horns, there are strings connecting the components of the rotary valves. These strings will break on occasion, and they can be an ordeal to tie – especially if the student or director is inexperienced. Consult this diagram for a string-tying guide:\nFRENCH HORN MAINTENANCE KIT LIST – RECOMMEND ITEMS\n______________________________________________________________________________\nFRENCH HORN MAINTENANCE KIT – OPTIONAL RECOMMENDED ITEMS\nFRENCH HORN METHOD BOOKS\nFRENCH HORN SUPPLEMENTAL BOOKS\nFRENCH HORN CASES, IDENTIFICATION OF PARTS AND REMOVING IT FROM ITS CASE\nGeneral Information about All Brass Cases\nMost cases have distinguishing marks somewhere on the case.  Identify these marks, and their relationship to the top and bottom of the case.  Most cases have the handles placed on the bottom section of each case.  Check to make sure.\nPlace all French horn cases on the floor in front of the student.\nBe sure the student understands where and which direction each part of the instrument belongs in the case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make sure the student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure the parts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse order they were removed.\nThe French horn should be removed first, followed by the mouthpiece.  When putting the instrument back, the order is reversed – mouthpiece first, followed by the French horn.\nAll instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure explicitly every time.\nNever leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up, but this is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.  Check each opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to your students.\nCases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom setup for each student’s case.  If using an ensemble room for the class, the cases may be opened in the hall.  The empty case will remain closed and latched in the hall during class.\nWhen instruments are in their cases, do not allow students to sit on their cases AT ANY TIME because the lead pipe and/or bell will get bent.\nSpecific Information about Removing the French Horn from Its Case\nOpen the case fully before removing the French horn. Some cases may not open such that both sides are on the floor. For these cases, one side will stay up and possibly fall on the horn while removing it from the case.\nWhen possible, remove the French horn by gripping the main pipe running between all the valves and slides. This is the sturdiest part of the instrument. Do not grip the horn by the bell, as the bell contains some of the thinner layers of metal on the instrument.\nFRENCH HORN SLIDES\nMain Tuning Slide – The main tuning slide is the first slide on the horn.  It is located on the back side of the horn.  This slide affects the pitch of both sides of the horn (F and B-flat).\nF Tuning Slide – Double horns will have an additional slide on the back of the horn, the F Tuning Slide that only affects the F side of the horn (without the trigger).  The main tuning slide should be set first before setting this slide.  On a Kruspe wrap horn (more open wrap) the main tuning slide and F tuning slide will face in opposite directions.  On a Geyer wrap horn (tighter wrap = brighter sound) these slides will face the same direction. (see pictures below)\nExamples of Kruspe wrap horns: Conn 8D, Yamaha 668, Yamaha 668II, Conn 6D, Holton 179\nExample of a Geyer wrap horn: Yamaha 667\n“Fake” Tuning Slide – Many horns will have a fake tuning slide located on the front side of the horn, near the mouthpiece.  This slide is used to empty water that collects in the horn – not for tuning purposes. This is the only slide on the horn that should be pushed in almost all the way.\nB-flat Tuning Slide – Some horns will also have a B-flat tuning slide which only affects the pitch of the B-flat side of the horn (with the trigger).  This is a short slide that is located on the front of the horn, in line with the valve slides.  It should be pulled about ¼ of an inch and then left alone.  Adjustments to the B-flat side of the horn should be done with the main tuning slide.\nValve Slides – Each valve has its own tuning slide.  The F side valve slides are located in front, and the B-flat valve slides are the smaller ones located behind.  The valve slides should be set approximately equidistant with each other.  The F side slides should be pulled about ¼-3/8 of an inch.  The B-flat side slides should be pushed in slightly more than the F side slides because it is a shorter horn.  The 1st and 2nd valve slides can be pulled out very slightly more to help compensate for the sharp 1-2 valve combination, and the 3rd valve can be pushed in very slightly more to help compensate for the flat 2-3 valve combination, especially on the Conn 8Ds. The Bb side 3rd valve needs to be barely out on the Conn 8D horns (as noted in the “Setting Slides” handout) because of 3rd space C#, which is very flat.\nPARTS OF THE FRENCH HORN\nFRENCH HORN INSTRUMENT/BODY RATIO AND HAND POSITION\nInstrument/Body Ratio\nAssuming that the student is either standing or sitting with correct posture, instruct them to pick up the body of the French horn with both hands and simply lift it by using their arms.  Move the instrument up and down, side to side, higher than usual and lower than usual.  As students are doing this, have them notice how it affects the balance of the body.  Eventually, the body should feel as balanced with or without the instrument in hand.\nMake sure students bring instruments to them… and not them to the instruments.  When done incorrectly, their body collapses and their air is obstructed.\nShoulders should be straight across when facing the director and it should feel the same way when doing breathing exercises  (do not twist or shift the upper body out of the breathing position)\nThe French horn should not be slanted in a manner in which moves the students’ head from its natural position.\nAngles of mouthpieces should be slightly lower than level.\nAlthough single F horns are lighter and easier for students to control in the beginning stages of playing, it is suggested that beginning French horn students are started on double horns. Of course, this decision may be dictated by what instruments are available in your inventory.\nHand Position\nThe most natural shape of everyone’s hands forms a flat “C”.\nAll hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall behind the wrist.\nThere should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the French horn.\nThe inside of the arm must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding the French horn correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\nElbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be hampered.\nPlace both the left and the right hand in their correct “beginner” position.  The left hand is placed on the valves and will lie in the “flat-C” position.  No tension should be felt in this hand, as the fingers move “with” the valves.\nThe right hand will be cupped on the outer ridge of the bottom of the bell.  Both hands hold and balance the French horn in the beginning.  The horn does not rest on the leg.  The right hand is not placed inside the bell until the teacher determines that the student can balance the horn in this manner.  An added bonus to holding the French horn by the bottom of the bell will result in the student being able to hear—and expect to hear—a more resonant sound when the hand is finally in its correct/more advanced position inside the bell.\nThough not a part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling the instrument toward the student’s face.  Instruct students to keep their elbows soft while playing the French horn.\nThe palms of both hands should feel soft.\nThe teacher must watch young students closely to monitor that their shoulders stay balanced and feel naturally soft at all times.\nFRENCH HORN FACE/EMBOUCHURE\nEach student should use their own “safe/unbreakable” mirror—both in the classroom and at home.\nUsing the mirror, have each student notice how natural their face looks.  They will have to later remember and memorize how it looks and feels.\nThe head must be balanced on the shoulders in a comfortable position—not too far forward and not too far backward.\nThe eyes should be soft and natural, and the “sight line” should be exactly level.  The distance between eyebrows should not change as air goes in and out of the body.\nLook for natural creases in the face, and allow any that are naturally present to exist while playing.  No other creases are allowed.\nThe corners should move in toward the canine/eye teeth.  The corners should never look or feel pulled back.\nThe corners can move down from the natural position as the student progresses but they can never move up.\nThe texture of both the upper and lower lip should be very soft and relaxed.\nThere should be natural space between the inside of the lips and the gums and teeth.  This space should not change or feel different when the lips vibrate inside the cup of the mouthpiece.  Please remember the demonstration given in today’s presentation.\nThe back teeth are slightly apart and should feel the same as when the student is reading, watching television, etc.  The teeth should not be pressed into each other when doing these other activities.\nBrass instrument embouchures are formed with a natural overbite.  A student with an underbite should be steered away from brass instrument.\nThe thickness of a student’s lips should correspond to the size of the cup of the mouthpiece for the chosen instrument.  Students with a very full top or bottom lip should be steered towards low brass instruments rather than French horn.\nThe bottom of the front of the tongue should lie in the soft tissue area which is located in the front of the mouth just behind the ridge of the bottom gum.\nRemember that when playing the French horn, cheeks will only “puff out” if the air is not freely going into the instrument.\nAssuming that the above has been achieved, the embouchure will be formed with special attention to the following:\nThe mouthpiece must be placed in the middle of the mouth—up and down as well as side to side. Two-thirds upper lip and one-third bottom lip is also a good rule of thumb if some have trouble with placing the mouthpiece in the middle of the mouth.\nThe corners are in their natural position and should be set against the canine/eye teeth.\nThe lips must be allowed to freely vibrate in response to the airstream rather than made to “buzz” in front of the airstream.\nThe lips must feel natural so that air can freely move past them—they must not be pulled back against the teeth or blown away from the teeth and gums.\nThe students should remember that the mouthpiece “gathers” the air—not the lips.\nThere must never be more energy placed against the upper lip than the lower lip; hence when playing the French horn, the student will slightly turn their head to the left so the leadpipe appears to angle slightly downwards from the embouchure. There is a simple trick for setting the mouthpiece angle:\nTake the mouthpiece, attached to the leadpipe, and set it against the teeth.\nAllow the rim to sit so that it hits both upper and lower teeth naturally.\nWherever this angle is, this is the “default” playing angle for that student (as this is how air will naturally proceed from their mouth in the middle register).\nStudents must be taught to play “down into the French horn” with the bell to the side of the body as it was meant to be played—instead of at the mouthpiece with the bell of the horn into the stomach.\nRegarding playing “off the leg,” or with the bell raised up from the leg: this technique is useful for students as they grow taller, as these students may have to otherwise contort their backs or compromise lung capacity to play on the leg. Rather than playing with the bell on the thigh, the right hand bears some of the weight of the horn while playing off the leg. Special attention to upper lip/lower lip pressure is needed when doing this adjustment, as the student may be tempted to put extra pressure on the upper lip at first.\nFRENCH HORN ARTICULATION\nThe tongue moves in the same manner when articulating a brass instrument as it does when you speak.  The tongue moves up and down—not back and forth—both when speaking and when articulation on an instrument.\nThe purpose of the tongue is to release the air, which causes the lips to vibrate and creates the sound. The tongue’s release of the air simply defines the beginning/start of the vibration/sound.\nArticulation is used to define the vibrations necessary to create musical rhythm, style and movement-- to contrast the use of slurring (which also creates similar musical entities).\nThe students should think that the tongue “articulates” the sound created by the airstream.  If the student is taught to create the sound correctly, articulation will be an easy transition.\nSound occurs when the air moves past the naturally vibrating lips.\nArticulate the sound that is already present.\nTeach students to articulate at the moment the sound begins.\nWithout the instrument or mouthpiece, use the following procedure:\n1.   Say the word “DOG”.\nSing the syllable “DAH”.\nOnce these are mastered, have the student use the mouthpiece and instrument and reproduce the “DAH” syllable in their brain to create an articulated sound.\nThe tongue should feel the same when saying, singing and playing the mouthpiece and instrument.\nThe tongue should touch the enamel of the upper teeth directly below the gum line—in the same spot with the same strength every time.\nUse the syllable “DAH” because it creates smoother and more easily controlled air as opposed to the “TAH” syllable.\nAfter each “articulation”, the tongue must immediately fall down into its natural position.\nThe tongue will be naturally soft at all times, but can touch the teeth with different strengths.\nThe tongue will be in its “down position” 98% of the time when articulating correctly.\nThe French horn requires a warmer and “darker” airstream than the trumpet.\nHave the student start their sound with the air.\nUsing the information about the basics of articulation, have the student articulate as fast as they can with no limitations of numbers, worries about evenness of articulation, etc.  Simply get them used to articulating!\nHave the student then use the “ta-day” syllable to practice using the tongue in an organized manner.\nHave the student then articulate “on command.”  The student will start their sound, and articulate when you snap your fingers to practice gaining more control of the tongue.\nOnce the student understands pulse and the foot pat, have the student articulate exactly when the toe of the foot touches the floor.\nHave the student articulate with the down and up position of the foot. Proceed to written rhythms as they begin to read music.\nAlways practice this entire routine.  The student must always go through the entire process, so he will not lose the ability to move his tongue at various speeds and in unstructured manners.\nAdvanced technique for low register (around 2nd space C in bass clef): move the tongue lower, toward the bottom of the top teeth. If the articulation is generally unclear in the lower/pedal register, this technique does wonders to “clean up” the articulation.\nAdvanced technique for muted playing: articulate way firmer. The articulation needs to be far more defined to compensate for the straight mute placed in the bell – and not quite as firm an articulation for stopped horn playing.\nFRENCH HORN FLEXIBILITY AND RANGE EXTENSTION\nBrass playing is based upon flexibility.\nThere are two types of flexibility: flexibility within the instrument and flexibility within the note.\nStudents eventually need to be flexible through each of the harmonic series in order to move up and down within the range of the instrument.\nOnce the student can reproduce at will a given pitch, the teacher must decide whether flexibility up or down is needed first.\nFlexibility is controlled by air direction and the isometrics created by the corners and canine/eye teeth.  The head must always stay in its natural, balanced position at all times.  The angle of the instrument must not change at any time…exception being possibly in the extreme low register (below 2nd space C) and the high register (above G on top of the treble clef staff). Many professional horn players around the world recommend angle changes in these registers if there are sound production problems. This is a technique to use with very advanced high school players, but not with middle school/junior high students.\nStudents must learn to angle the air in the cup of the mouthpiece without changing the position of the lips and/or the relationship of the upper and lower teeth. Flexibility is also enhanced by vowel sounds used in various registers.  These sounds can be “ah” for the middle register….”ee” for the upper register….and “oh” for the lower register.  Have students practice saying these vowel sounds with vocalization on appropriate lower, middle and higher sounds.\n“Ee” starts around 3rd space C.\n“Ah” is used from middle C to 3rd space C.\n“Oh” starts in the range from around middle C to below the staff A.\n“Ooh” can be used in the low register (2nd space C in the bass clef). The “ooh” vowel shape corrects sharp pitch tendencies, tight tone quality, and inability to produce notes in this register.\n“Howaii” – that is, “Hoh” + “wah” + “ee” – takes students through each vowel sound. It is also very similar to “Hawaii”, making it easy to remember.\nBring to the students’ attention that the shape of the tongue changes dramatically from vowel sound to vowel sound.  All students should be aware that vowel sounds are the middles of words that they speak every day.  Practice saying words that use the required vowel sounds. (i.e.  bow, ball, beep) As students move between vowel sounds, remind them to keep their throats relaxed. As they ascend, there may be a tendency to close the throat while saying “ee.” This is counterproductive to playing high; therefore, students should be blowing with a relaxed body.  The oral cavity and the lips are the only things that should change.\nRange is developed through flexibility.  It is more important to create a resonant sound while practicing flexibility than to create wider intervals.  The student can enhance their range by making more resonant sounds in the middle register before trying to extend higher or lower.\nMake sure students understand the texture of the lips has nothing to do with range.  For example, students should never be told to “tighten” their lips in order to play in the higher register. The shape of the lips remains the same throughout all registers; therefore, students should not smile in the high register.\nAll basic fundamentals for teaching brass instruments hold true for the French horn.  Remember the harmonics on the French horn are much closer than on the trumpet.  Flexibility is actually easier to achieve on the French horn, but accuracy is more difficult.  Do not be too demanding in the very beginning in regards to accuracy.\nStart asking beginning students what note they think they are playing. This will be more easily accomplished after having them sing some basic/simple passages. There must be an awareness of where the students are playing on the harmonic series of the horn.\nA big problem with younger students is being unable to tell that they are on the incorrect harmonic while playing. Again, this is to build awareness and not necessarily to demand accuracy.\nAs students descend, there is a common tendency to run out of air because they are not used to blowing all the way through the instrument. This will start happening around 4th line F in the bass clef. Students must blow large amounts of slow, hot air. Sometimes they try blowing a lot of air…but it comes out too fast because they are blowing too hard.\nFRENCH HORN GENERAL\nTUNING TENDENCIES\nThe Harmonic Series\nThe harmonic series is the set of notes that can be played on one finger combination.\nHere is the harmonic series for open (no valves pressed):\nOn the French horn, there is one harmonic series for each valve combination on both the F and Bb sides to make a total of 12 different harmonic series.\nEach harmonic series has similar pitch tendencies as the ones listed on this diagram. Transpose the series up or down depending on the valve combination:\nT0: Up a perfect fourth (starts on F below the bass clef)\nT2: Up a major third (starts on E below the bass clef)\nT1: Up a minor third (starts on Eb below the bass clef)\nT12: Up a major second (starts on D below the bass clef)\nT23: Up a minor second (starts on Db below the bass clef)\n2: Down a minor second (starts on B below the bass clef)\n1: Down a major second (starts on Bb below the bass clef)\n12: Down a minor third (starts on A below the bass clef)\n23: Down a major third (starts on Ab below the bass clef)\n13: Down a perfect fourth (starts on G below the bass clef)\n123: Down a tritone (starts on Gb below the bass clef)\nTo remedy pitch problems as listed on the diagram:\nAdjust the vowel shape\nAdjust the right hand\nUse a different fingering\nIn addition to the above general harmonic tendencies of the horn, the following notes have additional tuning issues associated with them. A number refers to a particular valve. A “0” refers to open or no valves depressed.\nSharp Notes\nFlat Notes\nGeneral Tendencies\nAs shown above, the valve combinations 12, 23, 13, 123, T12, and T23 all generally produce sharp notes on the horn.\nFor some notes with these fingerings, alternate fingerings can be used to alleviate pitch problems. With others of these fingerings, a combination of vowel placement and right hand tuning must be used to compensate for these fingerings.\nTUNING AND\nSETTING FRENCH HORN SLIDES\nYou must know what kind of horn the student is playing because the number of tuning slides varies.\nDo not tune just one note.  The placement for each note can vary.  Tuning just one note will not give you an accurate slide setting.\nSlide settings do matter, but not as much as playing fundamentals.  If a student is vibrating the wrong note on the mouthpiece, the sound can be incorrect in a number of different ways.\nCommon Mistakes Regarding French Horn Tuning\nInaccurate or inconsistent hand placement\nInaccurate or inconsistent slide placement\nPulling the wrong slide\nPulling a slide for the wrong reason\nWrong ratio of tuning slides to one another\nWill the correct slide please stand up…?\nThere are three kinds of tuning slides on horn:\nF side\nBb side\nCombination or main slide\nThe top stack of valve slides is the F side; the bottom stack is the Bb side.  Single-sided horns only have one stack.\nThe water slide on the front and closest to the player is an imposter; this slide should be pushed almost all the way in all the time.\nAll tuning slides should be pulled about the same amount and be in equal ratio with each other.\nHOLTON FARKAS H179\nThe main slide is on the top but in the back (while on the lap).\nThe Bb tuning slide is sideways in the front.\nThe F tuning slide is the bottom slide on the back.\nThe front vertical slide is a fake tuning slide.  This slide is used for emptying water and does not affect tuning.\nAll valve slides should be pulled about ¼ of an inch.\nCONN 8D\nThe fake/wannabe water slide is on the front (from the student’s point of view).\nThe main slide is on the top in the back.\nThe F slide is on the bottom in the back.\nThe 3rd valve slide on Bb side should be pulled out a tiny amount – enough so it does not become stuck, but not enough to affect tuning. 3rd space C#’s are noticeably flat on this horn, and the other T23 and T3 valve combinations will be fine despite this adjustment.\nYAMAHA 667\nThe Bb and F slides are side by side on the back.\nOther Brands\nTake out the slide in question. Play a note without the trigger.  If you hear a note rather than a mystery sound, the F side does not use that tuning slide.  Play a note with the trigger. If you hear a note rather than a mystery sound, the Bb side does not use that tuning slide.\nSetting French Horn Slides\nIt is important to set French horn slides early.  Setting horn slides helps to establish pitch center.  Do not “tune” the slides – just set the slides. At first, beginners will not have a correct pitch center, so tuning the slides is useless. Additionally, there is an extensive tuning process for tuning each slide.\nAt first, all slides should be pulled out ¼ inch (even the fake/wannabe water slide). French horns are made to be in tune with the slides out, and this will keep the slides from becoming stuck.\nAs students become more advanced, slides can be individually tuned.\nThe 1st, 2nd and 3rd valve tuning slides should be pulled out equidistantly on the F side of the horn.\nThe C Major Scale: Tuning the Horn from Middle C to 5th line F\nTuning the F Side (no trigger)\nHave the student play the first five notes from first ledger line below the staff C to second line G.  Eye ball the entire part of the scale.  This generally tunes the F side of the horn.  Set the tuner to first line E and second line G.  All concert F’s should be in tune on the F side.\nTo tune the 1st, 2nd and 3rd valve slides on the F side, descend chromatically from middle C. Below the staff B and Bb should be in tune (via the 1st and 2nd valves on the F side, respectively), and below the staff Ab can somewhat tune the 3rd valve after tuning the 2nd valve with below the staff B.\nTuning the Bb side (trigger)\nHave the student play second line G to third space C.  This generally tunes the Bb (trigger) side of the horn.  You are really looking at the 3rd space C. (If C and G are in tune but A and B are out of tune, adjust the second valve slide.)\nTo tune the 1st, 2nd and 3rd valve slides on the Bb side, descend chromatically from 1st space F (which should be in tune). 1st line E and Eb should in tune (via the 1st and 2nd valves on the Bb side, respectively). Use below the staff Db to tune the 3rd valve after tuning the 2nd valve, although the note should stand slightly out of tune.\nHave the student play 3rd space C to 5th line F.  Eye ball the entire part of the scale.  You are really looking at the C and the F.  (If the D and E are out of tune, adjust the bottom first or second valve slide.) Like the octave below, this is supposed to be the “in-tune” harmonic; however, students may have trouble playing with proper vowel shapes in this register.\nADVANCED TECHNIQUES FOR FRENCH HORN\nThere are numerous techniques beyond range, flexibility, articulation, and other fundamentals that are vital to playing literature for more mature horn players, such as a fair amount of works for high school band.\nRight Hand Technique\nAfter the beginner year, the right hand player must be placed into the bell for proper tone quality and tuning.\nTo create the create the correct right hand shape:\nTake the right hand and hold it out like shaking a person’s hand.\nBring all the fingers together so they are touching each other then let the thumb rest on top of the index finger.\nKeeping a relaxed hand, put this right hand into the bell so that the knuckles are touching the far side of the bell and line up to where the bell begins to flare.\nDepending on the teacher’s preference, the index finger can be anywhere from a “12 o’ clock” to a “10 o’ clock” position in the bell.\nThe hand should be straight, while the wrist, elbow and shoulder should be relaxed and free of tension.\nThe wrist can be bent or straight depending on the needs of the student.\nThe hand must not be cupped while in the bell, as this will produce a muffled sound.\nIndividual students will need to adjust how far in the hand must be and how much to turn their hand according to body size, tuning, and tone quality.\nA noticeably sharp, bright sound means that the hand is too far out.\nA noticeably flat, muffled sound means that the hand is too far in.\nA muffled sound may also mean that the hand is too cupped.\nTransposition\nTransposition is the process involved while playing a horn part written for a horn not in the key of F (ex. Horn in C, Dvorak Symphony No. 9, mvt.1, Horns 3 and 4).\nThe general rule is: C’s a C, sounds the key. This means that a written C on any part will sound the key of the instrument playing that part.\nEx. A written C for clarinet in A sounds an A on the piano and other non-transposing instruments.\nRemember, the transposition is from the printed “Horn in _” key to Horn in F.\nA little trick to find the transposition interval is to find the closest interval between Horn in F and the printed horn key. This is the interval and direction for the transposition.\nEx. The music has printed “Horn in A.” The interval between Horn in F and Horn in A is an ascending major third, so one would play a major third up from the printed notes.\nThe most common keys or transpositions are Horn in E and Horn in Eb.\nTo transpose Horn in E, play a half-step lower than printed.\nEx. A written 3rd line B-natural would be played as a Bb/A#.\nTo transpose Horn in Eb, play a whole-step lower than written.\nEx. A written 5th line F would be played as a(n) Eb/D#.\nAs exercises, have students transpose short segments of a familiar slow piece at first. The familiarity will allow them to use their ear to help determine if their transposition is correct.\nThen, lengthen the selection of pieces and include faster pieces. After this, include pieces in various meters and with accidentals.\nA common mistake when transposing is forgetting accidentals and key signatures. These must be accounted for when transposing a part.\nDo not allow students to write in transposed note names. This skill is sight-transposing, and this crutch may hinder students’ progress in learning to properly transpose.\nThis is a skill that requires dedication, persistence, and drill. A little daily practice…even 2 minutes…will improve the skill.\nMuted Horn\nMuted horn is called for by a variety of directions, but always involved putting a straight mute into the bell of the horn.\nThere is no hand alternative to this technique, so a string or other mechanism for holding the mute by hanging at the wrist is vital for quick mute changes.\nMusical directions for muted horn:\n“Mute” vs. “Open”\nEnglish pieces/contemporary pieces\n“Mute” denotes a section to be played with the mute in.\n“Open” denotes a section to be played with the mute out.\nMit Dampfer vs. ohne Dampfer\nGerman composers\nMit Dampfer means “with dampener” or with the mute in.\nOhne Dampfer means “without dampener” or with the mute out.\nCon sordino vs. senza sordino\nCon sordino denotes to play with the mute in.\nSenza sordino denotes to play with the mute out.\nAs very common directions, these can be abbreviated to con sord. and senza sord.\nFor all of these directions, they each denote a section of music to played accordingly, like tempo or style directions.\nTo play effectively, the player must put more air into their sound and horn, regardless of the dynamic. At all dynamics above piano, there must be a slight buzz to the sound.\nStopped Horn\nStopped horn, called for via various directions in the part, is accomplished in one of two ways:\nMuting the horn with a stop mute\nThis is simple: stick the stop mute in the bell of the horn like a straight mute, ensuring that the hole is completely sealed. The seal is open if there is an airy sound or leak.\nThis is easier to produce the desired sound, especially in the lower register.\nIt takes some time to move the mute in and out of the horn, so a string should be tied to the mute.\nIf the mute change is too fast in the music, the player must hand mute the horn.\nMuting the horn by fully closing the bell bore with the hand\nTo hand-mute the horn, simply collapse the wrist of the right hand to seal the opposite wall as the fingers. Rotate or adjust the fingers or wrist to completely seal the horn.\nAgain, an airy, muffled or diffuse (lacking in support) sound reveals an incomplete seal in the hand.\nThis is the technique favored by professionals, and it does not require an additional mute.\nThis is the best stopped horn technique for quick mute changes.\nIn both cases, the player must blow a noticeably larger amount of air – like playing a normal forte or fortissimo – such that the player produces a buzzy or brassy sound.\nThis is more difficult as one descends the range of the horn – it is difficult just below the staff, and quite difficult near low C (2nd space C in bass clef).\nIn both cases, the section to be stopped must be transposed like Horn in E – played a half-step lower than written, on the F side.\nFor a few notes, this transposition will not produce the correct note or play close to “in-tune.” On these notes (which are different on each horn), experiment to find a fingering which will play the note “in-tune.”\nRemember, play a half-step lower on the F side, even above 2nd line G.\nMusic directions for stopped horn:\n(+) = stopped, (o) = open\nThis is a common direction in newer music and simple to remember.\nIn this system, there are usually +’s over each note to be stopped, and a single “o” to end the stopped horn direction.\nGestopft vs. Offen\nGestopft denotes stopped\nOffen denotes open\nFor these directions, the word will be printed above the beginning of the section to be stopped or opened.\nUntil the next gestopft or offen direction, the music is played according to the last direction given.\nThis is the common system used by German composers, such as Wagner and Mahler.\nBouché cuivré vs. Ouvert\nBouché cuivré denotes stopped horn.\nIt may sometimes be denoted as just cuivré (closed) or, mistakenly, as bouché (brassy). If the music only notes bouché, check previous recordings to see if the direction is for stopped horn or just a loud, brassy sound.\nOuvert or a similar-looking word denotes open.\nThis system works the same as the German system for stopped horn directions.\nReading Bass Clef\nAll French horn players should be proficient in reading both treble and bass clef, particularly 2nd and 4th horn players.\nOlder pieces (generally those written before 1880-1900) that are not edited to modern notation will have bass clef horn parts written an octave lower than played.\nIf it appears absurdly low in the bass clef, the part is probably meant to be transposed up.\nThe transposition is to play the part an octave higher than written.\nFor example: A C two lines below the bass clef would be played as a 2nd space C in the bass clef.\nTo practice this bass clef transposition skill, simply assign horn players to transpose tuba parts at first; then, give them real examples of 4th horn parts from any Classical or Romantic Era symphony to transpose.\nLike other transpositions, consistent practice will teach this skill in a matter of weeks.\nOther Techniques\nLip Trills\nThis is a rapid alteration between two adjacent notes on the harmonic series.\nThis is called for on the harmonics no further than a whole-step apart.\nEssentially, it is a fast series of lip slurs.\nThe key to the technique is an ease of air flow between the two alternating notes: the constant air makes the trill, along with a slight motion of the back of the tongue.\nOnce a rapid speed is desired, a slight oscillation of the jaw will aid the clarity of the lip trill.\nRemember, the lip trill is an alternation between two notes a whole step apart. The lips should not noticeably move between the two notes.\nThe lip trill, like transposition, requires consistent and diligent practice. Additionally, it requires technical facility and good flexibility to achieve.\nThe lip trill is called for by the normal trill directions, and it is distinguished from the half-step trill by the key of the piece. If the trill is a half-step trill, it is a valve trill. If it is a whole-step trill, it is a lip trill.\nConsult professional recordings of any Mozart horn concerto to hear a good lip trill.\nEcho/shadow horn\nPrimarily a French direction, this is the technique of nearly fully closing the hand in the bell and transposing up a half-step.\nThe desired sound is muffled and distant.\nTypically denoted by sons d’echo\nFor example: Horn I in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice by Paul Dukas\nHand tuning\nThis involves the fine tuning of pitch using the right hand.\nYounger students do not have consistent pitch, so this technique is only applicable to students with stable pitch – whether in-tune or not.\nTo sharpen the pitch:\nThe hand can be pulled out of the bell.\nThe wrist can be bent away from the player.\nThe arm can be moved away from the player.\nTo flatten the pitch:\nThe hand can be pushed into the bell.\nThe wrist can be bent toward the player.\nThe arm can be moved toward the player.\nThis phenomenon occurs because moving the hand adjusts the “length” of the French horn.\nClosing the hand produces a longer surface for sound to travel, thus lengthening the horn and lowering the pitch.\nOpening the hand produces a shorter surface for sound to travel, thus shortening the horn and raising the pitch.\nThese adjustments are no larger than about a quarter tone either direction, so the hand is useful only for small adjustments of pitch.\nEMPTYING THE FRENCH HORN\nEmptying the horn can be an ordeal, especially if the water is somewhere between slides; however, proper techniques and skill with emptying the horn using the appropriate slides will purge 90% of the water.\nIt is actually 95-99% condensation and 1-5% spit that produces the gurgling sounds; therefore, “spit” covering the floor under the horn section is mostly water, not disgusting saliva.\nWhenever emptying the horn, the basic technique (aside from using a dedicated spit valve, which some instruments may not have) is taking a particular slide off of the horn and turning the horn such that the water falls out.\nTo make more water come out, always turn the horn so that the water moves vertically. This means that the slide to be emptied must point perpendicular to the ground.\nIn the case of the main tuning slide (the one attached to the leadpipe) and the F tuning slide, simply take the slide off and dump the water.\nFor all other slides, including the Bb tuning slide (if the horn has a Bb tuning slide), the corresponding valve(s) must be depressed to properly empty the horn.\nConsult the diagram on the next page for valves and corresponding slides.\nFailure to properly depress the valves while emptying water does negatively affect the sealing on the rotors, and will slowly make the rotors move slower.\nTricks for finding water:\nHold down each valve and blow air through the horn. Remember to blow through the valves on the Bb side as well. Any audible gurgle means there is water in that particular slide.\nA gurgle without any valves depressed means that the water could be in:\nthe main tuning slide\nthe “fake” tuning slide/water slide\nthe F tuning slide\nthe area after all of the valves and before the bell\nTo empty this section, fully turn the horn clockwise – then point the bell semi-vertically such that water can fall to the ground.\nTo catch any “pesky” water:\nTurn the horn so that the valves are pointed vertically up and the keys are on the lower side.\nWiggle all the keys for a few seconds, including the trigger.\nAfter this, depress the trigger and the 3rd valve.\nTilt the horn 180° so that the keys are up and the slides are vertical, with the holes pointed down.\nTake out the Bb side 3rd valve.\nWatch as water magically falls out of the horn.\nFrench Horn Diagram"

    "text": "INSTRUMENTS OF THE FRENCH HORN FAMILY\nSingle Horn\nPitched either in F or Bb (this should be obvious when purchasing the horn)\nIn either case, the player will read music for Horn in F.\nThe single horn will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch.\nThis horn is a common starter horn due to its light weight, especially for smaller students.\nThe single F horn will have a smoother sounding low register, but the high register will have many tuning, accuracy and general tone issues.\nTuning notes for the single F horn are written middle C and below the staff B, Bb, A, and Ab.\nThe single Bb horn has a quicker response and an easier, more in-tune and better sounding high register.\nTuning notes for the single Bb horn are written 1st space F, 2nd line E and Eb and below the staff D and Db.\nAs these instruments are typically starter instruments. The student will need to move to a double horn during the later middle school/early high school years.\nDouble Horn\nPitched in both F and Bb\nFor most American double horns, the top set of slides is the F side while the bottom set of slides is the Bb side.\nTo use the Bb side, depress the thumb trigger.\nThe player will read music for Horn in F.\nThe descant horn will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch.\nTuning notes for the double horn include tuning notes for both sides:\nTuning notes for the F side are written middle C and below the staff B, Bb, A and Ab.\nTuning notes for the Bb side are written 1st space F, 2nd line E and Eb and below the staff D and Db.\nThe double horn is the typical instrument of choice from middle school to the professional level. The combination of the secure high range of the Bb side and the smooth low range of the F side meets most of the needs of the horn player well.\nDescant Horn\nPitched in Bb and either high F or high Eb.\nLike the double horn, the top set of slides is the Bb side while the bottom set of slides is either the high F or high Eb side.\nLike the double horn, depress the trigger to use the high F or high Eb side.\nTuning notes for the descant horn include tuning notes for each of the sides:\nTuning for the high F side are written 3rd space C, 3rd line B and Bb and 2nd line A and Ab.\nTuning notes for the high Eb side are written 3rd line Bb, 2nd space A and Ab and 2nd line G and Gb.\nThe descant horn is used to assist a professional horn player who is required to play in the high register.\nThe high F or high Eb side provides a more secure high register than the Bb side.\nThe descant horn is made for professional assistance, not to compensate for technical deficiencies in younger players. As such, this horn should not be used at the secondary level.\nTriple Horn\nPitched in F, Bb and either high F or high Eb.\nJust as the double horn, the top set of slides is the F side, the middle set is the Bb side, and the bottom set is either high F or high Eb.\nLike the double horn, depress either the top trigger for the Bb side or the bottom trigger for the high F or high Eb side.\nThe triple horn will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch.\nTuning notes for the triple horn include tuning notes for each of the three sides:\nTuning notes for the high F side are written 3rd space C, 3rd line B and Bb and 2nd line A and Ab.\nThe triple horn is essentially a double horn with a descant side. Due to specific compensations in horn construction, each of the sides will not sound as resonant as on double horns with the particular sides.\nThe triple horn provides a more secure high register on the high F or high Eb side while maintaining the flexibility of range in the other two sides.\nThe triple horn, like the descant horn, is made to assist professional players, not to compensate for technical deficiencies in younger players. As such, this horn should not be used at the secondary level.\nVienna Horn\nThe Vienna horn comes with a crook mechanism. As such, the player can play in all twelve chromatic keys, using particular crooks according to particular composer directions or particular keys.\nThe most common crook is the F crook, so the horn is most often pitched in F.\nThe player will read music written for horn in any key. The player must read the music for the particular horn key printed.\nThe most common crook is the F crook, so the player will usually read music for Horn in F.\nAs this horn can play in any key via the crook mechanism, its sounding pitch will vary according to the crook used.\nThe rule for finding the transposition is, “C’s a C, sounds the key.” This means that a printed C in any octave will produce the key of the crook without any valves depressed.\nFor example, a Vienna horn with an A crook would sound a 2nd space A if the printed note was 3rd space C. As such, the transposition for the A crook would be down a minor 3rd from concert pitch.\nThe most common crook is the F crook, so the Vienna horn will sound a perfect 5th lower than concert pitch.\nTuning notes for the Vienna horn will vary according to the crook used.\nThe most common crook is the F crook. Tuning notes for the Vienna horn with an F crook are written middle C and below the staff B, Bb, A and Ab.\nWhile the Vienna horn still uses teardrop keys (like on all other horns), the horn uses the pump valve system. This system is essentially a double-piston valve system, where the pistons are activated with long rods attached to the teardrop keys.\nThis system allows for the characteristic smooth legatos and slurs heard on the Vienna horn.\nThe Vienna horn is only used in Vienna, Austria, most famously in the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.\nThe Vienna horn will not be used at the secondary level.\nMarching Horn\nPitched in Bb\nThe marching horn will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch.\nTuning notes for the marching horn are written 1st space F, 2nd line E and Eb and below the staff D and Db.\nThe marching horn was not necessarily designed to play in tune. Tuning will be a constant issue with this instrument.\nThe marching horn is one of the two marching band versions of French horns. This instrument is used in marching band because the bell faces toward the front rather than behind (as a normal French horn would).\nThe fact that the marching horn is pitched in Bb makes it easier and more accurate to play.\nMellophone\nPitched in high F or high Eb\nThe player will read music for Horn in F or for Horn in Eb.\nThe mellophone will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch if pitched in high F or a major 6th below concert pitch if pitched in high Eb.\nMost marching bands will use mellophones pitch in high F.\nTuning notes the mellophone depend on its pitch.\nTuning notes for a high F and high Eb mellophone are written 3rd space C, 3rd line B and Bb and 2nd line A and Ab.\nFor the high F mellophone, these notes are concert F, E, Eb, D and Db.\nFor the high Eb mellophone, these notes are concert Eb, D, Db, C and B.\nLike the marching horn, the mellophone was not necessarily designed to play in tune. Tuning will be a constant issue with this instrument.\nThe mellophone is the second of the two marching band versions of French horns. This instrument is used in marching band because the bell faces toward the front rather than behind (as a normal French horn would).\nThe fact that the mellophone is pitched in F gives the player a more secure high register."

    "text": "FRENCH HORN SLIDES\nMain Tuning Slide – The main tuning slide is the first slide on the horn.  It is located on the back side of the horn.  This slide affects the pitch of both sides of the horn (F and B-flat).\nF Tuning Slide – Double horns will have an additional slide on the back of the horn, the F Tuning Slide that only affects the F side of the horn (without the trigger).  The main tuning slide should be set first before setting this slide.  On a Kruspe wrap horn (more open wrap) the main tuning slide and F tuning slide will face in opposite directions.  On a Geyer wrap horn (tighter wrap = brighter sound) these slides will face the same direction. (see pictures below)\nExamples of Kruspe wrap horns: Conn 8D, Yamaha 668, Yamaha 668II, Conn 6D, Holton 179\nExample of a Geyer wrap horn: Yamaha 667\n“Fake” Tuning Slide – Many horns will have a fake tuning slide located on the front side of the horn, near the mouthpiece.  This slide is used to empty water that collects in the horn – not for tuning purposes. This is the only slide on the horn that should be pushed in almost all the way.\nB-flat Tuning Slide – Some horns will also have a B-flat tuning slide which only affects the pitch of the B-flat side of the horn (with the trigger).  This is a short slide that is located on the front of the horn, in line with the valve slides.  It should be pulled about ¼ of an inch and then left alone.  Adjustments to the B-flat side of the horn should be done with the main tuning slide.\nValve Slides – Each valve has its own tuning slide.  The F side valve slides are located in front, and the B-flat valve slides are the smaller ones located behind.  The valve slides should be set approximately equidistant with each other.  The F side slides should be pulled about ¼-3/8 of an inch.  The B-flat side slides should be pushed in slightly more than the F side slides because it is a shorter horn.  The 1st and 2nd valve slides can be pulled out very slightly more to help compensate for the sharp 1-2 valve combination, and the 3rd valve can be pushed in very slightly more to help compensate for the flat 2-3 valve combination, especially on the Conn 8Ds. The Bb side 3rd valve needs to be barely out on the Conn 8D horns (as noted in the “Setting Slides” handout) because of 3rd space C#, which is very flat."

    "text": "INSTRUMENTS OF THE FRENCH HORN FAMILY\nSingle Horn\nDouble Horn\nDescant Horn\nTriple Horn\nVienna Horn\nMarching Horn\nMellophone\n•  Pitched either in F or Bb (this should be obvious when purchasing the horn)\n•  In either case, the player will read music for Horn in F.\n•  The single horn will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch.\n•  This horn is a common starter horn due to its light weight, especially for\nsmaller students.\n•  The single F horn will have a smoother sounding low register, but the high\nregister will have many tuning, accuracy and general tone issues.\n•  Tuning notes for the single F horn are written middle C and below the staff\nB, Bb, A, and Ab.\n•  The single Bb horn has a quicker response and an easier, more in-tune and\nbetter sounding high register.\n•  Tuning notes for the single Bb horn are written 1st space F, 2nd line E and Eb\nand below the staff D and Db.\n•  As these instruments are typically starter instruments. The student will need\nto move to a double horn during the later middle school/early high school\nyears.\n•  Pitched in both F and Bb\n§  For most American double horns, the top set of slides is the F side\nwhile the bottom set of slides is the Bb side.\n§  To use the Bb side, depress the thumb trigger.\n•  The player will read music for Horn in F.\n•  The descant horn will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch.\n•  Tuning notes for the double horn include tuning notes for both sides:\n§  Tuning notes for the F side are written middle C and below the staff\nB, Bb, A and Ab.\n§  Tuning notes for the Bb side are written 1st space F, 2nd line E and Eb\n•  The double horn is the typical instrument of choice from middle school to\nthe professional level. The combination of the secure high range of the Bb\nside and the smooth low range of the F side meets most of the needs of the\nhorn player well.\n•  Pitched in Bb and either high F or high Eb.\n§  Like the double horn, the top set of slides is the Bb side while the\nbottom set of slides is either the high F or high Eb side.\n§  Like the double horn, depress the trigger to use the high F or high Eb\nside.\n•  Tuning notes for the descant horn include tuning notes for each of the sides:\n§  Tuning for the high F side are written 3rd space C, 3rd line B and Bb\nand 2nd line A and Ab.\n§  Tuning notes for the high Eb side are written 3rd line Bb, 2nd space A\nand Ab and 2nd line G and Gb.\n•  The descant horn is used to assist a professional horn player who is required\nto play in the high register.\n§  The high F or high Eb side provides a more secure high register than\nthe Bb side.\n•  The descant horn is made for professional assistance, not to compensate for\ntechnical deficiencies in younger players. As such, this horn should not be\nused at the secondary level.\n•  Pitched in F, Bb and either high F or high Eb.\n§  Just as the double horn, the top set of slides is the F side, the middle\nset is the Bb side, and the bottom set is either high F or high Eb.\n§  Like the double horn, depress either the top trigger for the Bb side or\nthe bottom trigger for the high F or high Eb side.\n•  The triple horn will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch.\n•  Tuning notes for the triple horn include tuning notes for each of the three\nsides:\n§  Tuning notes for the high F side are written 3rd space C, 3rd line B and\nBb and 2nd line A and Ab.\n•  The triple horn is essentially a double horn with a descant side. Due to\nspecific compensations in horn construction, each of the sides will not sound\nas resonant as on double horns with the particular sides.\n•  The triple horn provides a more secure high register on the high F or high Eb\nside while maintaining the flexibility of range in the other two sides.\n•  The triple horn, like the descant horn, is made to assist professional players,\nnot to compensate for technical deficiencies in younger players. As such,\nthis horn should not be used at the secondary level.\n•  The Vienna horn comes with a crook mechanism. As such, the player can\nplay in all twelve chromatic keys, using particular crooks according to\nparticular composer directions or particular keys.\n§  The most common crook is the F crook, so the horn is most often\npitched in F.\n•  The player will read music written for horn in any key. The player must read\nthe music for the particular horn key printed.\n§  The most common crook is the F crook, so the player will usually read\nmusic for Horn in F.\n•  As this horn can play in any key via the crook mechanism, its sounding pitch\nwill vary according to the crook used.\n§  The rule for finding the transposition is, “C’s a C, sounds the key.”\nThis means that a printed C in any octave will produce the key of the\ncrook without any valves depressed.\n§  For example, a Vienna horn with an A crook would sound a 2nd space\nA if the printed note was 3rd space C. As such, the transposition for\nthe A crook would be down a minor 3rd from concert pitch.\n§  The most common crook is the F crook, so the Vienna horn will sound\na perfect 5th lower than concert pitch.\n•  Tuning notes for the Vienna horn will vary according to the crook used.\n§  The most common crook is the F crook. Tuning notes for the Vienna\nhorn with an F crook are written middle C and below the staff B, Bb,\nA and Ab.\n•  While the Vienna horn still uses teardrop keys (like on all other horns), the\nhorn uses the pump valve system. This system is essentially a double-piston\nvalve system, where the pistons are activated with long rods attached to the\nteardrop keys.\n§  This system allows for the characteristic smooth legatos and slurs\nheard on the Vienna horn.\n•  The Vienna horn is only used in Vienna, Austria, most famously in the\nVienna Philharmonic Orchestra.\n•  The Vienna horn will not be used at the secondary level.\n•  Pitched in Bb\n•  The marching horn will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch.\n•  Tuning notes for the marching horn are written 1st space F, 2nd line E and Eb\n§  The marching horn was not necessarily designed to play in tune.\nTuning will be a constant issue with this instrument.\n•  The marching horn is one of the two marching band versions of French\nhorns. This instrument is used in marching band because the bell faces\ntoward the front rather than behind (as a normal French horn would).\n•  The fact that the marching horn is pitched in Bb makes it easier and more\naccurate to play.\n•  Pitched in high F or high Eb\n•  The player will read music for Horn in F or for Horn in Eb.\n•  The mellophone will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch if pitched in\nhigh F or a major 6th below concert pitch if pitched in high Eb.\n•  Most marching bands will use mellophones pitch in high F.\n•  Tuning notes the mellophone depend on its pitch.\n§  Tuning notes for a high F and high Eb mellophone are written 3rd\nspace C, 3rd line B and Bb and 2nd line A and Ab.\n§  For the high F mellophone, these notes are concert F, E, Eb, D and\nDb.\n§  For the high Eb mellophone, these notes are concert Eb, D, Db, C and\nB.\n§  Like the marching horn, the mellophone was not necessarily designed\nto play in tune. Tuning will be a constant issue with this instrument.\n•  The mellophone is the second of the two marching band versions of French\n•  The fact that the mellophone is pitched in F gives the player a more secure\nhigh register.\nRECOMMENDED FRENCH HORN BRANDS\nBeginner:\nBrand: Conn\nModel: 6D\nPricing: MSRP $3299.00 @ wwbw.com\nDescription:\n•  Brass, more compact and lighter than the\nConn 8D\n•  Durable\n•  Have a tendency to play below pitch center\n•  Very acceptable for beginners\nProfessional:\nModel: 8D\nPricing: MSRP $4349.00 - $4559.00 @\nwwbw.com\n•  Nickel silver large bore horn-typically darker sound with less defined\ngrooves for the notes\n•  Requires more air control and more strength to play\n•  Heavier than other brands\n•  Not recommended for small beginning students or older students that have\nbad pitch distinction\n•  Very durable\n•  Watch 3rd space C# and 4th line D on this horn.\n§  3rd space C# will be terribly flat, and so the 3rd valve on the Bb side\nshould barely be pulled out (because G# below and above it will be\nfine with this valve in, and C# is a pretty common note).\n§  4th line D is often sharper than the other T12 valve combinations on\nthe horn – sometimes T3 actually puts this horn’s 4th line D in tune.\nBrand: Yamaha\nModel: YHR-667VL\nPricing: MSRP $7636.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  Considered a professional horn\n•  Free blowing\n•  Open wrap\n•  Excellent response and pitch adjustability\n•  Valves and slides are fussy and need to be maintained daily with valve oil.\n•  Designed to be played in the US and in Europe.\n•  Play above A=440Hz; this is why the slides are so long\n•  Very thin metal, not durable\nModel: YHR-668NII\nPricing: MSRP $4469.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  A little heavier than the Yamaha 667\n•  Thin and not durable metal\n•  Have quick response\nBrand: Holton\nModel: H179 Farkas Series\nPricing: MSRP $4349.00\n•  Nickel silver with bad finish\n•  Valves are mediocre because they are poorly\ndesigned. They do not stop bending when the valve is open.\n•  Smaller wrap and therefore lighter\n•  No pitch bends in the harmonics\n•  Less durable than Conns, but more durable than Yamahas\n•  Plays above pitch center\n•  Acceptable for beginners, and definitely better than a single horn\nFRENCH HORN MOUTHPIECES\n•  There are several parts to the French horn mouthpiece:\no  Rim – the contact point for the lips. This can come in various contours and grips.\n§  Flatter rim = better flexibility, rounder rim = better endurance\n§  Grip/bite – inside edge of rim. Round = better for thin lips, sharp = better\nfor think lips to ‘grip’ the mouthpiece\no  Cup diameter – the measurement of the diameter of the inside of the rim.\n§  Sizes are generally between 16.5 and 18.5mm\n§  The size determines how much of the lips can “fit” into the cup.\n§  Smaller = better for thinner lips, Larger = better for thick lips\no  Cup shape/depth\n§  Two sizes of cups – bowl-shaped and funnel-shaped.\n•  Bowl-shaped cups produce a warmer, rounder sound\n•  Funnel-shaped cups produce a more direct, ringing sound\n§  Shallow cups have faster response, better high range flexibility, and more\nfocused sound.\n§  Deeper cups have slower response, better low range flexibility, and a\nbroader sound.\no  Bore/backbore\n§  The bore is the hole at the end of the cup\n•  Size of the bore determines how free-flowing or resistant the\nmouthpiece is. Smaller = more resistance, Larger = less resistance\n•  Resistance helps with breath control, high range, and accuracy up\nto a point.\n§  The backbore is the gradual taper to the bore.\n•  A narrow, straight contour makes for less pitch flexibility and\nmore resistant loud playing, but has a more focused tone.\n•  A rounded contour makes for more pitch flexibility and has less\nresistance at loud dynamics and a darker, broader tone\no  Plating – the metal the mouthpiece is made of.\n§  The mouthpiece usually comes in nickel, silver, or gold, but there is not\n§\nmuch of a technical difference.\nIf a player has a metal allergy, rims can be made out of plastic such as\nDelrin or Lexan.\nRECOMMENDED\nGenerally, beginners will have thinner, smaller lips, so smaller rims, smaller\ninner cup diameters, moderate cup shape and depth, moderate bore size and a\nmoderate backbore contour will allow them sufficient ease of playing and\nflexibility.\nModel: 30C4\nPricing: MSRP $34.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  Easy response\n•  Good balance between endurance and\nflexibility\n(moderate rim contour)\n•  About halfway point between dark and bright\ntone qualities\nBrand: Schilke\nModel: 30 Silver\nPricing: MSRP $56.00 @ wwbw.com\n•  Produces darker tone sooner\nBrand: Stork\nModel: C8\nPricing: MSRP $60.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  More direct sound (straighter cup shape)\n•  Good flexibility (flatter rim)\nModel: MDC (Medium-Deep Cup)\nPricing: MSRP $59.00 @ wwbw.com\n•  Easy response across the entire range\n•  Small diameter for smaller lips\nPARTS OF THE FRENCH HORN MOUTHPIECE\nGrip/bite\nCup Diameter\nBore (inside)\nBackbore\n(inside)\nCup\nRim\nShank\n(outside)\nFRENCH HORN MAINTENANCE\nMouthpiece Maintenance\n•  Over time, grime and other dirty objects build up in the mouthpiece.\n•  To clean the mouthpiece:\n1.  Take a mouthpiece brush and run it through the mouthpiece under warm water in\nthe sink.\n§  The brush will not go all the way through, so insert the brush through both\nends to fully clean each end.\n§  Soap is not necessary, but it does not hurt the mouthpiece to use it. The\nsame goes for mouthwash. If these are used, simply rinse the mouthpiece\nthoroughly afterwards and let it air dry so that the alcohol evaporates.\n•  This process should be done every week to two weeks.\nSlide Maintenance\n•  The insides of the slides and various tubes build up grime, various dirt particles, and\ngerms, so the slides must be snaked at least once a month.\n•  To snake a horn:\n1.  Take out the appropriate slide, pressing down the appropriate valve while taking it\nout, and place the slide on a towel or soft surface.\n2.  Run water through the unattached slide, preferably in the opposite direction of air\nflow.\nIn the case of the main tuning slide and the lead pipe, also run water\nthrough the lead pipe – starting on the end with the tuning slide, not the\nend with the mouthpiece receiver.\n3.  Take the snake and run it through the slide which was taken out, preferably in the\nopposite direction of air flow.\n4.  Repeat the above step on the immovable part of the slide attached to the rotor. Be\ncareful to not jam the snake against the rotor.\n5.  Repeat the above two steps with all slides, including the main tuning slide, the F\ntuning slide and the Bb tuning slide.\n6.  Apply slide grease as necessary according to the below steps.\n•  There are numerous slides on the French horn. Each of these must be well-lubricated with\nslide grease. Refer to the “Maintenance Kit” handout for pictures of slide greases.\n•  To apply the grease:\n1.  Take out the slide to be greased, pressing down the appropriate valve.\n2.  With a paper towel, wipe off the slide to clean the grease and any grime on the\nslide.\n3.  If the grease is a liquid, squeeze the bottle and apply a line of grease down two\nsides of the slide. If the grease is more of a cream, use the index finger to apply\nthe grease along most of the length of the slide.\n§  Do not apply too much grease, as the slides can become too lubricated and\nfall out.\n4.  Re-insert the slide and slide it fully in and out a few times. Insert only one side of\nthe slide in and rotate the slide while moving it in and out. Press down the\nappropriate valve the entire time during this process.\n5.  Push the slide all the way in and use a paper towel to wipe off any extra grease\nlocated where the immovable and movable parts of the slide meet.\n6.  Repeat this process for all slides as needed – even fake tuning slides.\n•  This process should be done every month or so.\nValve Maintenance\n•  With a Holton French horn, you will have to constantly apply oil to the valves.\n•  Oil all the moving parts.  Oil is like most wonderful things…you cannot have too much!\n•  Put oil on the springs, under the valve cap, and inside the slides to keep the oil from\nmixing with slide grease and slowing down the valve.  Then move the slide in and out\nwhile pressing on the corresponding valve. Make sure that your students routinely\ndepress the keys when emptying their slides.\n•  There are two types of rotary oil – rotor oil and rotor spindle/bearing oil. Rotor oil looks\nlike normal valve oil, whereas spindle oil has a “needle-looking” thing. Rotor oil goes in\nthe slides to lubricate the outside of the rotor casing. Spindle/bearing oil goes under the\nvalve caps, such that the raised portion is covered in a small dome of oil. It also goes on\nthe underside, inside of a crevice between the middle vertical screw and the bumpers. The\nspindle/bearing oil lubricates the interior mechanism of the rotor. It is wise to not mix\nthese up, as the two oils have different thicknesses (and rotors do not like it when they\nhave the wrong oil).\n•  On some horns, there are strings connecting the components of the rotary valves. These\nstrings will break on occasion, and they can be an ordeal to tie – especially if the student\nor director is inexperienced. Consult this diagram for a string-tying guide:\nFRENCH HORN MAINTENANCE KIT LIST –\nRECOMMEND ITEMS\nRotor Oil\nMSRP $3.29 @ interstatemusic.com\n• This is the oil to be dripped inside the\nslides, as it is a lighter oil.\n• This oil is to be applied about every\ntwo weeks, or every week for heavy\nplaying.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nRotor Spindle/Bearing Oil\nMSRP $3.98 @ samash.com\n• This is the oil to be dripped on the tops\nand bottoms of the rotor casings, as it is a\nheavier oil.\n• This is oil is to be applied about every\n•\nSelmer Tuning Slide & Cork\nGrease\nMSRP $3.99 @jwpepper.com\nThe Selmer cork grease is a liquid and\nlasts much longer than most tuning slide\ngreases.\nCaution should be used when using this\nbecause it is very sticky\nMust be stored in a plastic Ziploc bag as it\nmay explode.\nIf it hits something in the case or if\nexposed to heat, it will damage other\nmaintenance kit items.\nTo apply, squeeze a tiny bit of the grease\nup and down onto the slide.  Then, insert\nslide back into the instrument using a back\nand forth motion until lubricated. Remove\nany excess grease with a cloth from the\nslide if necessary.\nFrench Horn Snake\nMSRP $4.99 @ interstatemusic.com\n• A snake is used to clean the inner and outer\nslides at least every six months\n• Be sure to not use metal snakes, as they will\nscratch the plating of the horn.\nYamaha Brass Mouthpiece\nBrush\nMSRP $2.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  Used to clean the inside of the mouthpiece\n•  Insert from the shank and twist to clean out the\nmouthpiece\n•  Does not go all the way through the mouthpiece\n•  Could scratch the inside of the cup of the\nmouthpiece if not used correctly\nFrench Horn BERP\nMSRP $17.99 @ wwbw.com\n• The BERP allows students to air, position,\nand vibrate while simulating playing position.\nIt is a good tool for ear training as the student\nadvances.\n8x10 Plexiglass\nBinswangerglass.com\n• Road man will not supply these\n• Prices vary depending on where mirrors are\npurchased.\n• Mirrors purchased through Binswanger can\nbe purchased in bulk and cut to a desired\nsize. They will also be made of plexiglass.\n• Purchasing mirrors at a home improvement\nstore is also an option; however, mirrors will\nhave to be individually cut by a band parent\nor yourself.\n• No matter where mirrors are purchased,   it\nis vital that they are made of plexiglass and\nnot glass. Students will not hurt themselves\non the corners of the mirrors; nor will the\nmirrors shatter when dropped.\n• To receive a better price, attempt to find\nother band directors who would be willing\nto place an order as well. Assuring the\ncompany that you will place annual orders\nmay also result in a discount.\n• Self-portrait mirrors from art supply stores\nare acceptable.\n• Car clip-on mirrors are not recommended\nbecause they are too small and the hinges\nbreak easily.\n• Makeup mirrors are not recommended\nbecause they are too small and oddly\nshaped.\nIt would be best if there was a box for the\nmirrors in each separate class location.\nStudents can then easily obtain a mirror out\nof the box before class and return the mirror\nafter class.\nFRENCH HORN MAINTENANCE KIT –\nOPTIONAL RECOMMENDED ITEMS\nOne of the following can be used depending on socio-economic environment, availability, or\npreference when selecting a suitable metronome.\nQwik Time QT-5 Metronome\nMSRP $7.95 @ wwbw.com\n•  This metronome does not have a\nsubdivision function.\n•  Credit card-sized\n•  A-440 tuning tone\n•  Low-battery indicator\nKorg MA-1 Metronome\nMSRP $24.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  Beat-Counting display makes it easier to\npractice rhythm and phrasing.\n•  Tap Tempo function makes it easier to\nquickly set the desired tempo.\n•  Beat display offers from 1 to 9 beats, plus\n8 rhythm types to practice any style of\nmusic.\n•  Can tune any instrument using the 12-step\n(C4 – B4) chromatic reference pitch\n•  Adjustable calibration setting (410 – 480\nHz)\n•  Earphone jack with adjustable volume\n•  Memory backup function and auto\npower-off function\n•  Up to approximately 290 hours of\ncontinuous operation\nKorg TM-50 Digital Tuner/ Metronome\nMSRP $29.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  Offers both a tuner and metronome,\nwhich function simultaneously or\nindependently\n•  Contains 13 types of rhythms that cover\n0-7 beats per measure as well as doublets,\ntriplets, triplets with center beats omitted,\nquadruplets, and quadruplets with center\nbeats omitted\n•  Tempo is easily adjustable in a range of\n40—208BPM.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nOne of the following music stands can be chosen depending on socio-economic environment,\navailability, or preference.\nHamilton Folding Music Stand\nMSRP $10.79 @ wwbw.com\n•  Collapsible and easy to transport\nSelmer Music Stand with Bag\nMSRP $26.95 @ wwbw.com\nFrench Horn String\nMSRP $3.99\n• This string is only for French horns without\nmetal linkages for the valves.\n• The method for tying this string can be found\nonline or in The Art of French Horn Playing.\nPolishing Cloth\nMSRP $7.95\n• This cloth must be made for silver or\ngold plating, depending on the\nappropriate plating of the horn.\n• This cloth wipes off any acid from\nfingerprint residue in addition to\nkeeping a generally polished look to\nthe horn.\nHetman 7 or 8 – Premium Slide\nGrease Standard\nMSRP $9.00 @ wwbw.com\n• The Hetman Slide Grease is a cream and\n• Caution should be used when using this\n• To apply, remove a small amount of cream\nfrom container and smear onto slide.

Identify these marks,\nand their relationship to the top and bottom of the case.  Most cases have the handles\nplaced on the bottom section of each case.  Check to make sure.\n•  Place all French horn cases on the floor in front of the student.\n•  Be sure the student understands where and which direction each part of the\ninstrument belongs in the case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from\nthe case.  Make sure the student waits for each instruction before performing the\ntask.  Be sure the parts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse order\nthey were removed.\n•  The French horn should be removed first, followed by the mouthpiece.  When putting\nthe instrument back, the order is reversed – mouthpiece first, followed by the French\nhorn.\n•  All instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure\nexplicitly every time.\n•  Never leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up, but this\nis not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.  Check each\nopening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to your students.\n•  Cases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom setup\nfor each student’s case.  If using an ensemble room for the class, the cases may be\nopened in the hall.  The empty case will remain closed and latched in the hall during\nclass.\n•  When instruments are in their cases, do not allow students to sit on their cases AT\nANY TIME because the lead pipe and/or bell will get bent.\nSpecific Information about Removing the French Horn from Its Case\n•  Open the case fully before removing the French horn. Some cases may not open such\nthat both sides are on the floor. For these cases, one side will stay up and possibly fall\non the horn while removing it from the case.\n•  When possible, remove the French horn by gripping the main pipe running between\nall the valves and slides. This is the sturdiest part of the instrument. Do not grip the\nhorn by the bell, as the bell contains some of the thinner layers of metal on the\ninstrument.\nFRENCH HORN SLIDES\nMain Tuning Slide – The main tuning slide is the first slide on the horn.  It is located on the\nback side of the horn.  This slide affects the pitch of both sides of the horn (F and B-flat).\nF Tuning Slide – Double horns will have an additional slide on the back of the horn, the F\nTuning Slide that only affects the F side of the horn (without the trigger).  The main tuning slide\nshould be set first before setting this slide.  On a Kruspe wrap horn (more open wrap) the main\ntuning slide and F tuning slide will face in opposite directions.  On a Geyer wrap horn (tighter\nwrap = brighter sound) these slides will face the same direction. (see pictures below)\nExamples of Kruspe wrap horns: Conn 8D, Yamaha 668, Yamaha 668II, Conn 6D, Holton 179\nExample of a Geyer wrap horn: Yamaha 667\n“Fake” Tuning Slide – Many horns will have a fake tuning slide located on the front side of the\nhorn, near the mouthpiece.  This slide is used to empty water that collects in the horn – not for\ntuning purposes. This is the only slide on the horn that should be pushed in almost all the way.\nB-flat Tuning Slide – Some horns will also have a B-flat tuning slide which only affects the\npitch of the B-flat side of the horn (with the trigger).  This is a short slide that is located on the\nfront of the horn, in line with the valve slides.  It should be pulled about ¼ of an inch and then\nleft alone.  Adjustments to the B-flat side of the horn should be done with the main tuning slide.\nValve Slides – Each valve has its own tuning slide.  The F side valve slides are located in front,\nand the B-flat valve slides are the smaller ones located behind.  The valve slides should be set\napproximately equidistant with each other.  The F side slides should be pulled about ¼-3/8 of an\ninch.  The B-flat side slides should be pushed in slightly more than the F side slides because it is\na shorter horn.  The 1st and 2nd valve slides can be pulled out very slightly more to help\ncompensate for the sharp 1-2 valve combination, and the 3rd valve can be pushed in very slightly\nmore to help compensate for the flat 2-3 valve combination, especially on the Conn 8Ds. The Bb\nside 3rd valve needs to be barely out on the Conn 8D horns (as noted in the “Setting Slides”\nhandout) because of 3rd space C#, which is very flat.\nKRUSPE\nGEYER\nF Tuning Slide\nCONN 8D\nYAMAHA 668\nFake Tuning Slide\nMain Tuning Slide\nYAMAHA 668II\nCONN 6D\nHOLTON H179\nYAMAHA 667\nThe trigger valve casing is\nlocated on the far end of\nthe horn.

As\nstudents are doing this, have them notice how it affects the balance of the body.  Eventually,\nthe body should feel as balanced with or without the instrument in hand.\n•  Make sure students bring instruments to them… and not them to the instruments.  When done\nincorrectly, their body collapses and their air is obstructed.\n•  Shoulders should be straight across when facing the director and it should feel the same way\nwhen doing breathing exercises  (do not twist or shift the upper body out of the breathing\nposition)\n•  The French horn should not be slanted in a manner in which moves the students’ head from\nits natural position.\n•  Angles of mouthpieces should be slightly lower than level.\n•  Although single F horns are lighter and easier for students to control in the beginning\nstages of playing, it is suggested that beginning French horn students are started on\ndouble horns. Of course, this decision may be dictated by what instruments are\navailable in your inventory.\nHand Position\n1.  The most natural shape of everyone’s hands forms a flat “C”.\n2.  All hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall behind the wrist.\n3.  There should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the French horn.\n4.  The inside of the arm must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding the\nFrench horn correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\n5.  Elbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be hampered.\n6.  Place both the left and the right hand in their correct “beginner” position.  The left hand is\nplaced on the valves and will lie in the “flat-C” position.  No tension should be felt in this\nhand, as the fingers move “with” the valves.\n7.  The right hand will be cupped on the outer ridge of the bottom of the bell.  Both hands hold\nand balance the French horn in the beginning.  The horn does not rest on the leg.  The right\nhand is not placed inside the bell until the teacher determines that the student can balance the\nhorn in this manner.  An added bonus to holding the French horn by the bottom of the bell\nwill result in the student being able to hear—and expect to hear—a more resonant sound\nwhen the hand is finally in its correct/more advanced position inside the bell.\n8.  Though not a part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling the\ninstrument toward the student’s face.  Instruct students to keep their elbows soft while\nplaying the French horn.\n9.  The palms of both hands should feel soft.\n10. The teacher must watch young students closely to monitor that their shoulders stay balanced\nand feel naturally soft at all times.\nFRENCH HORN FACE/EMBOUCHURE\n•  Each student should use their own “safe/unbreakable” mirror—both in the classroom and\nat home.\n•  Using the mirror, have each student notice how natural their face looks.  They will have\nto later remember and memorize how it looks and feels.\n•  The head must be balanced on the shoulders in a comfortable position—not too far\nforward and not too far backward.\n•  The eyes should be soft and natural, and the “sight line” should be exactly level.  The\ndistance between eyebrows should not change as air goes in and out of the body.\n•  Look for natural creases in the face, and allow any that are naturally present to exist\nwhile playing.  No other creases are allowed.\n•  The corners should move in toward the canine/eye teeth.  The corners should never look\nor feel pulled back.\n•  The corners can move down from the natural position as the student progresses but they\ncan never move up.\n•  The texture of both the upper and lower lip should be very soft and relaxed.\n•  There should be natural space between the inside of the lips and the gums and teeth.  This\nspace should not change or feel different when the lips vibrate inside the cup of the\nmouthpiece.  Please remember the demonstration given in today’s presentation.\n•  The back teeth are slightly apart and should feel the same as when the student is reading,\nwatching television, etc.  The teeth should not be pressed into each other when doing\nthese other activities.\n•  Brass instrument embouchures are formed with a natural overbite.  A student with an\nunderbite should be steered away from brass instrument.\n•  The thickness of a student’s lips should correspond to the size of the cup of the\nmouthpiece for the chosen instrument.  Students with a very full top or bottom lip should\nbe steered towards low brass instruments rather than French horn.\n•  The bottom of the front of the tongue should lie in the soft tissue area which is located in\nthe front of the mouth just behind the ridge of the bottom gum.\n•  Remember that when playing the French horn, cheeks will only “puff out” if the air\nis not freely going into the instrument.\n•  Assuming that the above has been achieved, the embouchure will be formed with special\nattention to the following:\n1.  The mouthpiece must be placed in the middle of the mouth—up and down as\nwell as side to side. Two-thirds upper lip and one-third bottom lip is also a\ngood rule of thumb if some have trouble with placing the mouthpiece in the\nmiddle of the mouth.\n2.  The corners are in their natural position and should be set against the\ncanine/eye teeth.\n3.  The lips must be allowed to freely vibrate in response to the airstream rather\nthan made to “buzz” in front of the airstream.\n4.  The lips must feel natural so that air can freely move past them—they must\nnot be pulled back against the teeth or blown away from the teeth and gums.\n5.  The students should remember that the mouthpiece “gathers” the air—not the\nlips.\n6.  There must never be more energy placed against the upper lip than the lower\nlip; hence when playing the French horn, the student will slightly turn their\nhead to the left so the leadpipe appears to angle slightly downwards from the\nembouchure. There is a simple trick for setting the mouthpiece angle:\na.  Take the mouthpiece, attached to the leadpipe, and set it against the\nteeth.\nb.  Allow the rim to sit so that it hits both upper and lower teeth naturally.\nc.  Wherever this angle is, this is the “default” playing angle for that\nstudent (as this is how air will naturally proceed from their mouth in\nthe middle register).\n7.  Students must be taught to play “down into the French horn” with the bell to\nthe side of the body as it was meant to be played—instead of at the\nmouthpiece with the bell of the horn into the stomach.\n8.  Regarding playing “off the leg,” or with the bell raised up from the leg: this\ntechnique is useful for students as they grow taller, as these students may have\nto otherwise contort their backs or compromise lung capacity to play on the\nleg. Rather than playing with the bell on the thigh, the right hand bears some\nof the weight of the horn while playing off the leg. Special attention to upper\nlip/lower lip pressure is needed when doing this adjustment, as the student\nmay be tempted to put extra pressure on the upper lip at first.\nFRENCH HORN ARTICULATION\n•  The tongue moves in the same manner when articulating a brass instrument as it does\nwhen you speak.  The tongue moves up and down—not back and forth—both when\nspeaking and when articulation on an instrument.\n•  The purpose of the tongue is to release the air, which causes the lips to vibrate and creates\nthe sound. The tongue’s release of the air simply defines the beginning/start of the\nvibration/sound.\n•  Articulation is used to define the vibrations necessary to create musical rhythm, style and\nmovement-- to contrast the use of slurring (which also creates similar musical entities).\n•  The students should think that the tongue “articulates” the sound created by the airstream.\nIf the student is taught to create the sound correctly, articulation will be an easy\ntransition.\na.  Sound occurs when the air moves past the naturally vibrating lips.\nb.  Articulate the sound that is already present.\nc.  Teach students to articulate at the moment the sound begins.\n•  Without the instrument or mouthpiece, use the following procedure:\n1.   Say the word “DOG”.\n2.  Sing the syllable “DAH”.\n3.  Once these are mastered, have the student use the mouthpiece and instrument\nand reproduce the “DAH” syllable in their brain to create an articulated sound.\n4.  The tongue should feel the same when saying, singing and playing the\nmouthpiece and instrument.\n5.  The tongue should touch the enamel of the upper teeth directly below the gum\nline—in the same spot with the same strength every time.\n6.  Use the syllable “DAH” because it creates smoother and more easily\ncontrolled air as opposed to the “TAH” syllable.\n7.  After each “articulation”, the tongue must immediately fall down into its\nnatural position.\n8.  The tongue will be naturally soft at all times, but can touch the teeth with\ndifferent strengths.\n9.  The tongue will be in its “down position” 98% of the time when articulating\ncorrectly.\n10. The French horn requires a warmer and “darker” airstream than the trumpet.\n•  Have the student start their sound with the air.\n•  Using the information about the basics of articulation, have the student articulate as fast\nas they can with no limitations of numbers, worries about evenness of articulation, etc.\nSimply get them used to articulating!\n•  Have the student then use the “ta-day” syllable to practice using the tongue in an\norganized manner.\n•  Have the student then articulate “on command.”  The student will start their sound, and\narticulate when you snap your fingers to practice gaining more control of the tongue.\n•  Once the student understands pulse and the foot pat, have the student articulate exactly\nwhen the toe of the foot touches the floor.\n•  Have the student articulate with the down and up position of the foot. Proceed to written\nrhythms as they begin to read music.\n•  Always practice this entire routine.  The student must always go through the entire\nprocess, so he will not lose the ability to move his tongue at various speeds and in\nunstructured manners.\n•  Advanced technique for low register (around 2nd space C in bass clef): move the tongue\nlower, toward the bottom of the top teeth. If the articulation is generally unclear in the\nlower/pedal register, this technique does wonders to “clean up” the articulation.\n•  Advanced technique for muted playing: articulate way firmer. The articulation needs to\nbe far more defined to compensate for the straight mute placed in the bell – and not quite\nas firm an articulation for stopped horn playing.\nFRENCH HORN FLEXIBILITY AND RANGE\nEXTENSTION\n•  Brass playing is based upon flexibility.\n•  There are two types of flexibility: flexibility within the instrument and flexibility within\nthe note.\n•  Students eventually need to be flexible through each of the harmonic series in order to\nmove up and down within the range of the instrument.\n•  Once the student can reproduce at will a given pitch, the teacher must decide whether\nflexibility up or down is needed first.\n•  Flexibility is controlled by air direction and the isometrics created by the corners and\ncanine/eye teeth.  The head must always stay in its natural, balanced position at all times.\nThe angle of the instrument must not change at any time…exception being possibly in the\nextreme low register (below 2nd space C) and the high register (above G on top of the\ntreble clef staff). Many professional horn players around the world recommend angle\nchanges in these registers if there are sound production problems. This is a technique to\nuse with very advanced high school players, but not with middle school/junior high\nstudents.\n•  Students must learn to angle the air in the cup of the mouthpiece without changing the\nposition of the lips and/or the relationship of the upper and lower teeth. Flexibility is also\nenhanced by vowel sounds used in various registers.  These sounds can be “ah” for the\nmiddle register….”ee” for the upper register….and “oh” for the lower register.  Have\nstudents practice saying these vowel sounds with vocalization on appropriate lower,\nmiddle and higher sounds.\n1.  “Ee” starts around 3rd space C.\n2.  “Ah” is used from middle C to 3rd space C.\n3.  “Oh” starts in the range from around middle C to below the staff A.\n4.  “Ooh” can be used in the low register (2nd space C in the bass clef). The “ooh”\nvowel shape corrects sharp pitch tendencies, tight tone quality, and inability to\nproduce notes in this register.\n5.  “Howaii” – that is, “Hoh” + “wah” + “ee” – takes students through each\nvowel sound. It is also very similar to “Hawaii”, making it easy to remember.\n•  Bring to the students’ attention that the shape of the tongue changes dramatically from\nvowel sound to vowel sound.  All students should be aware that vowel sounds are the\nmiddles of words that they speak every day.  Practice saying words that use the required\nvowel sounds. (i.e.  bow, ball, beep) As students move between vowel sounds, remind\nthem to keep their throats relaxed. As they ascend, there may be a tendency to close the\nthroat while saying “ee.” This is counterproductive to playing high; therefore, students\nshould be blowing with a relaxed body.  The oral cavity and the lips are the only things\nthat should change.\n•  Range is developed through flexibility.  It is more important to create a resonant sound\nwhile practicing flexibility than to create wider intervals.  The student can enhance their\nrange by making more resonant sounds in the middle register before trying to extend\nhigher or lower.\n•  Make sure students understand the texture of the lips has nothing to do with range.  For\nexample, students should never be told to “tighten” their lips in order to play in the higher\nregister. The shape of the lips remains the same throughout all registers; therefore,\nstudents should not smile in the high register.\n•  All basic fundamentals for teaching brass instruments hold true for the French horn.\nRemember the harmonics on the French horn are much closer than on the trumpet.\nFlexibility is actually easier to achieve on the French horn, but accuracy is more difficult.\nDo not be too demanding in the very beginning in regards to accuracy.\n1.  Start asking beginning students what note they think they are playing. This\nwill be more easily accomplished after having them sing some basic/simple\npassages. There must be an awareness of where the students are playing on the\nharmonic series of the horn.\n2.  A big problem with younger students is being unable to tell that they are on\nthe incorrect harmonic while playing. Again, this is to build awareness and not\nnecessarily to demand accuracy.\n•  As students descend, there is a common tendency to run out of air because they are not\nused to blowing all the way through the instrument. This will start happening around 4th\nline F in the bass clef. Students must blow large amounts of slow, hot air. Sometimes they\ntry blowing a lot of air…but it comes out too fast because they are blowing too hard.\nFRENCH HORN GENERAL\nTUNING TENDENCIES\nThe Harmonic Series\n•  The harmonic series is the set of notes that can be played on one finger combination.\n•  Here is the harmonic series for open (no valves pressed):\n+2\n+4\n+2  +41\n-14\n-32\n-14  -49\n-12\n•  On the French horn, there is one harmonic series for each valve combination on both the\nF and Bb sides to make a total of 12 different harmonic series.\n•  Each harmonic series has similar pitch tendencies as the ones listed on this diagram.\nTranspose the series up or down depending on the valve combination:\no  T0: Up a perfect fourth (starts on F below the bass clef)\no  T2: Up a major third (starts on E below the bass clef)\no  T1: Up a minor third (starts on Eb below the bass clef)\no  T12: Up a major second (starts on D below the bass clef)\no  T23: Up a minor second (starts on Db below the bass clef)\no  2: Down a minor second (starts on B below the bass clef)\no  1: Down a major second (starts on Bb below the bass clef)\no  12: Down a minor third (starts on A below the bass clef)\no  23: Down a major third (starts on Ab below the bass clef)\no  13: Down a perfect fourth (starts on G below the bass clef)\no  123: Down a tritone (starts on Gb below the bass clef)\n•  To remedy pitch problems as listed on the diagram:\no  Adjust the vowel shape\no  Adjust the right hand\no  Use a different fingering\nIn addition to the above general harmonic tendencies of the horn, the following notes\nhave additional tuning issues associated with them. A number refers to a particular valve.\nA “0” refers to open or no valves depressed.\nSharp Notes\n• Moderately sharp\n• Very sharp\n• More open “ah” vowel\n• Use open “ooh” vowel\n• Can use 3 to flatten pitch\n• Slightly sharp\n• More open “oh” vowel\n• Can use T3 to flatten pitch\n• Use open “ah” vowel\n• Very sharp on Conn 8D\n• Use open “ee” vowel\nIgnore this for Conn 8D\n• Can use T2, but may be too flat\nFlat Notes\n• Moderately flat\n• Use taller “ah” vowel\n• Very flat on Conn 8D\n• Push in T3 valve slide almost all\nthe way in because of this note\n• Moderately to very flat if\nT2 is used\n• Use taller “ee” vowel\nT0 is used\nGeneral Tendencies\n•  As shown above, the valve combinations 12, 23, 13, 123, T12, and T23 all generally\nproduce sharp notes on the horn.\n•  For some notes with these fingerings, alternate fingerings can be used to alleviate pitch\nproblems. With others of these fingerings, a combination of vowel placement and right\nhand tuning must be used to compensate for these fingerings.\nTUNING AND\nSETTING FRENCH HORN SLIDES\n1.  You must know what kind of horn the student is playing because the number of tuning\nslides varies.\n2.  Do not tune just one note.  The placement for each note can vary.  Tuning just one note\nwill not give you an accurate slide setting.\n3.  Slide settings do matter, but not as much as playing fundamentals.  If a student is\nvibrating the wrong note on the mouthpiece, the sound can be incorrect in a number of\ndifferent ways.\nInaccurate or inconsistent hand placement\nInaccurate or inconsistent slide placement\nCommon Mistakes Regarding French Horn Tuning\n•  Pulling the wrong slide\n•  Pulling a slide for the wrong reason\n•  Wrong ratio of tuning slides to one another\nWill the correct slide please stand up…?\n•  There are three kinds of tuning slides on horn:\no  F side\no  Bb side\no  Combination or main slide\n•  The top stack of valve slides is the F side; the bottom stack is the Bb side.  Single-sided horns\nonly have one stack.\n•  The water slide on the front and closest to the player is an imposter; this slide should be\npushed almost all the way in all the time.\n•  All tuning slides should be pulled about the same amount and be in equal ratio with each\nother.\nHOLTON FARKAS H179\n•  The main slide is on the top but in the back (while on the lap).\n•  The Bb tuning slide is sideways in the front.\n•  The F tuning slide is the bottom slide on the back.\n•  The front vertical slide is a fake tuning slide.  This slide is used for emptying water and does\nnot affect tuning.\n•  All valve slides should be pulled about ¼ of an inch.\n•  The fake/wannabe water slide is on the front (from the student’s point of view).\n•  The main slide is on the top in the back.\n•  The F slide is on the bottom in the back.\n•  The 3rd valve slide on Bb side should be pulled out a tiny amount – enough so it does not\nbecome stuck, but not enough to affect tuning. 3rd space C#’s are noticeably flat on this horn,\nand the other T23 and T3 valve combinations will be fine despite this adjustment.\n•  The Bb and F slides are side by side on the back.\nOther Brands\n•  Take out the slide in question. Play a note without the trigger.  If you hear a note rather than a\nmystery sound, the F side does not use that tuning slide.  Play a note with the trigger. If you\nhear a note rather than a mystery sound, the Bb side does not use that tuning slide.\nSetting French Horn Slides\nIt is important to set French horn slides early.  Setting horn slides helps to establish pitch\ncenter.  Do not “tune” the slides – just set the slides. At first, beginners will not have a\ncorrect pitch center, so tuning the slides is useless. Additionally, there is an extensive tuning\nprocess for tuning each slide.\n•  At first, all slides should be pulled out ¼ inch (even the fake/wannabe water slide). French\nhorns are made to be in tune with the slides out, and this will keep the slides from becoming\nstuck.\n•  As students become more advanced, slides can be individually tuned.\n•  The 1st, 2nd and 3rd valve tuning slides should be pulled out equidistantly on the F side of the\nThe C Major Scale: Tuning the Horn from Middle C to 5th line F\nTuning the F Side (no trigger)\n•  Have the student play the first five notes from first ledger line below the staff C to second\nline G.  Eye ball the entire part of the scale.  This generally tunes the F side of the horn.  Set\nthe tuner to first line E and second line G.  All concert F’s should be in tune on the F side.\n•  To tune the 1st, 2nd and 3rd valve slides on the F side, descend chromatically from middle C.\nBelow the staff B and Bb should be in tune (via the 1st and 2nd valves on the F side,\nrespectively), and below the staff Ab can somewhat tune the 3rd valve after tuning the 2nd\nvalve with below the staff B.\nTuning the Bb side (trigger)\n•  Have the student play second line G to third space C.  This generally tunes the Bb (trigger)\nside of the horn.  You are really looking at the 3rd space C. (If C and G are in tune but A and\nB are out of tune, adjust the second valve slide.)\n•  To tune the 1st, 2nd and 3rd valve slides on the Bb side, descend chromatically from 1st space F\n(which should be in tune). 1st line E and Eb should in tune (via the 1st and 2nd valves on the\nBb side, respectively). Use below the staff Db to tune the 3rd valve after tuning the 2nd valve,\nalthough the note should stand slightly out of tune.\n•  Have the student play 3rd space C to 5th line F.  Eye ball the entire part of the scale.  You are\nreally looking at the C and the F.  (If the D and E are out of tune, adjust the bottom first or\nsecond valve slide.) Like the octave below, this is supposed to be the “in-tune” harmonic;\nhowever, students may have trouble playing with proper vowel shapes in this register.\nADVANCED TECHNIQUES FOR FRENCH HORN\n•  There are numerous techniques beyond range, flexibility, articulation, and other\nfundamentals that are vital to playing literature for more mature horn players, such as a\nfair amount of works for high school band.\nRight Hand Technique\n•  After the beginner year, the right hand player must be placed into the bell for proper tone\nquality and tuning.\n•  To create the create the correct right hand shape:\n1.  Take the right hand and hold it out like shaking a person’s hand.\n2.  Bring all the fingers together so they are touching each other then let the thumb\nrest on top of the index finger.\n3.  Keeping a relaxed hand, put this right hand into the bell so that the knuckles are\ntouching the far side of the bell and line up to where the bell begins to flare.\na.  Depending on the teacher’s preference, the index finger can be anywhere\nfrom a “12 o’ clock” to a “10 o’ clock” position in the bell.\n4.  The hand should be straight, while the wrist, elbow and shoulder should be\nrelaxed and free of tension.\na.  The wrist can be bent or straight depending on the needs of the student.\n•  The hand must not be cupped while in the bell, as this will produce a muffled sound.\nIndividual students will need to adjust how far in the hand must be and how much to\nturn their hand according to body size, tuning, and tone quality.\no  A noticeably sharp, bright sound means that the hand is too far out.\no  A noticeably flat, muffled sound means that the hand is too far in.\no  A muffled sound may also mean that the hand is too cupped.\nTransposition\n•  Transposition is the process involved while playing a horn part written for a horn not in\nthe key of F (ex. Horn in C, Dvorak Symphony No. 9, mvt.1, Horns 3 and 4).\no  The general rule is: C’s a C, sounds the key. This means that a written C on any\npart will sound the key of the instrument playing that part.\n§  Ex. A written C for clarinet in A sounds an A on the piano and other non-\ntransposing instruments.\no  Remember, the transposition is from the printed “Horn in _” key to Horn in F.\no  A little trick to find the transposition interval is to find the closest interval\nbetween Horn in F and the printed horn key. This is the interval and direction for\nthe transposition.\n§  Ex. The music has printed “Horn in A.” The interval between Horn in F\nand Horn in A is an ascending major third, so one would play a major\nthird up from the printed notes.\no  The most common keys or transpositions are Horn in E and Horn in Eb.\n§  To transpose Horn in E, play a half-step lower than printed.\nv  Ex. A written 3rd line B-natural would be played as a Bb/A#.\n§  To transpose Horn in Eb, play a whole-step lower than written.\nv  Ex. A written 5th line F would be played as a(n) Eb/D#.\n§  As exercises, have students transpose short segments of a familiar slow\npiece at first. The familiarity will allow them to use their ear to help\ndetermine if their transposition is correct.\n§  Then, lengthen the selection of pieces and include faster pieces. After this,\ninclude pieces in various meters and with accidentals.\n§  A common mistake when transposing is forgetting accidentals and key\nsignatures. These must be accounted for when transposing a part.\n§  Do not allow students to write in transposed note names. This skill is\nsight-transposing, and this crutch may hinder students’ progress in\nlearning to properly transpose.\n§  This is a skill that requires dedication, persistence, and drill. A little daily\npractice…even 2 minutes…will improve the skill.\nMuted Horn\n•  Muted horn is called for by a variety of directions, but always involved putting a straight\nmute into the bell of the horn.\no  There is no hand alternative to this technique, so a string or other mechanism for\nholding the mute by hanging at the wrist is vital for quick mute changes.\n•  Musical directions for muted horn:\no  “Mute” vs. “Open”\n§  English pieces/contemporary pieces\n§  “Mute” denotes a section to be played with the mute in.\n§  “Open” denotes a section to be played with the mute out.\no  Mit Dampfer vs. ohne Dampfer\n§  German composers\n§  Mit Dampfer means “with dampener” or with the mute in.\n§  Ohne Dampfer means “without dampener” or with the mute out.\no  Con sordino vs. senza sordino\n§  Con sordino denotes to play with the mute in.\n§  Senza sordino denotes to play with the mute out.\n§  As very common directions, these can be abbreviated to con sord. and\nsenza sord.\no  For all of these directions, they each denote a section of music to played\naccordingly, like tempo or style directions.\n•  To play effectively, the player must put more air into their sound and horn, regardless of\nthe dynamic. At all dynamics above piano, there must be a slight buzz to the sound.\nStopped Horn\n•  Stopped horn, called for via various directions in the part, is accomplished in one of two\nways:\n1.  Muting the horn with a stop mute\n§  This is simple: stick the stop mute in the bell of the horn like a straight\nmute, ensuring that the hole is completely sealed. The seal is open if there\nis an airy sound or leak.\n§  This is easier to produce the desired sound, especially in the lower\nregister.\nIt takes some time to move the mute in and out of the horn, so a string\nshould be tied to the mute.\nIf the mute change is too fast in the music, the player must hand mute the\n2.  Muting the horn by fully closing the bell bore with the hand\n§  To hand-mute the horn, simply collapse the wrist of the right hand to seal\nthe opposite wall as the fingers. Rotate or adjust the fingers or wrist to\ncompletely seal the horn.\n§  Again, an airy, muffled or diffuse (lacking in support) sound reveals an\nincomplete seal in the hand.\n§  This is the technique favored by professionals, and it does not require an\nadditional mute.\n§  This is the best stopped horn technique for quick mute changes.\nIn both cases, the player must blow a noticeably larger amount of air – like playing a\nnormal forte or fortissimo – such that the player produces a buzzy or brassy sound.\no  This is more difficult as one descends the range of the horn – it is difficult just\nbelow the staff, and quite difficult near low C (2nd space C in bass clef).\nIn both cases, the section to be stopped must be transposed like Horn in E – played a half-\nstep lower than written, on the F side.\no  For a few notes, this transposition will not produce the correct note or play close\nto “in-tune.” On these notes (which are different on each horn), experiment to find\na fingering which will play the note “in-tune.”\no  Remember, play a half-step lower on the F side, even above 2nd line G.\n•  Music directions for stopped horn:\no  (+) = stopped, (o) = open\n§  This is a common direction in newer music and simple to remember.\nIn this system, there are usually +’s over each note to be stopped, and a\nsingle “o” to end the stopped horn direction.\no  Gestopft vs. Offen\n§  Gestopft denotes stopped\n§  Offen denotes open\n§  For these directions, the word will be printed above the beginning of the\nsection to be stopped or opened.\n§  Until the next gestopft or offen direction, the music is played according to\nthe last direction given.\n§  This is the common system used by German composers, such as Wagner\nand Mahler.\no  Bouché cuivré vs. Ouvert\n§  Bouché cuivré denotes stopped horn.\nIt may sometimes be denoted as just cuivré (closed) or, mistakenly,\nas bouché (brassy). If the music only notes bouché, check previous\nrecordings to see if the direction is for stopped horn or just a loud,\nbrassy sound.\n§  Ouvert or a similar-looking word denotes open.\n§  This system works the same as the German system for stopped horn\ndirections.\nReading Bass Clef\n•  All French horn players should be proficient in reading both treble and bass clef,\nparticularly 2nd and 4th horn players.\n•  Older pieces (generally those written before 1880-1900) that are not edited to modern\nnotation will have bass clef horn parts written an octave lower than played.\no  If it appears absurdly low in the bass clef, the part is probably meant to be\ntransposed up.\no  The transposition is to play the part an octave higher than written.\n§  For example: A C two lines below the bass clef would be played as a 2nd\nspace C in the bass clef.\n•  To practice this bass clef transposition skill, simply assign horn players to transpose tuba\nparts at first; then, give them real examples of 4th horn parts from any Classical or\nRomantic Era symphony to transpose.\n•  Like other transpositions, consistent practice will teach this skill in a matter of weeks.\nOther Techniques\n•  Lip Trills\no  This is a rapid alteration between two adjacent notes on the harmonic series.\no  This is called for on the harmonics no further than a whole-step apart.\no  Essentially, it is a fast series of lip slurs.\no  The key to the technique is an ease of air flow between the two alternating notes:\nthe constant air makes the trill, along with a slight motion of the back of the\ntongue.\n§  Once a rapid speed is desired, a slight oscillation of the jaw will aid the\nclarity of the lip trill.\n§  Remember, the lip trill is an alternation between two notes a whole step\napart. The lips should not noticeably move between the two notes.\n§  The lip trill, like transposition, requires consistent and diligent practice.\nAdditionally, it requires technical facility and good flexibility to achieve.\no  The lip trill is called for by the normal trill directions, and it is distinguished from\nthe half-step trill by the key of the piece. If the trill is a half-step trill, it is a valve\ntrill. If it is a whole-step trill, it is a lip trill.\no  Consult professional recordings of any Mozart horn concerto to hear a good lip\ntrill.\n•  Echo/shadow horn\no  Primarily a French direction, this is the technique of nearly fully closing the hand\nin the bell and transposing up a half-step.\no  The desired sound is muffled and distant.\no  Typically denoted by sons d’echo\no  For example: Horn I in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice by Paul Dukas\n•  Hand tuning\no  This involves the fine tuning of pitch using the right hand.\n§  Younger students do not have consistent pitch, so this technique is only\napplicable to students with stable pitch – whether in-tune or not.\no  To sharpen the pitch:\n§  The hand can be pulled out of the bell.\n§  The wrist can be bent away from the player.\n§  The arm can be moved away from the player.\no  To flatten the pitch:\n§  The hand can be pushed into the bell.\n§  The wrist can be bent toward the player.\n§  The arm can be moved toward the player.\no  This phenomenon occurs because moving the hand adjusts the “length” of the\nFrench horn.\n§  Closing the hand produces a longer surface for sound to travel, thus\nlengthening the horn and lowering the pitch.\n§  Opening the hand produces a shorter surface for sound to travel, thus\nshortening the horn and raising the pitch.\no  These adjustments are no larger than about a quarter tone either direction, so the\nhand is useful only for small adjustments of pitch.\nEMPTYING THE FRENCH HORN\n•  Emptying the horn can be an ordeal, especially if the water is somewhere between slides;\nhowever, proper techniques and skill with emptying the horn using the appropriate slides\nwill purge 90% of the water.\no  It is actually 95-99% condensation and 1-5% spit that produces the gurgling\nsounds; therefore, “spit” covering the floor under the horn section is mostly water,\nnot disgusting saliva.\n•  Whenever emptying the horn, the basic technique (aside from using a dedicated spit\nvalve, which some instruments may not have) is taking a particular slide off of the horn\nand turning the horn such that the water falls out.\no  To make more water come out, always turn the horn so that the water moves\nvertically. This means that the slide to be emptied must point perpendicular to the\nground.\nIn the case of the main tuning slide (the one attached to the leadpipe) and the F tuning\nslide, simply take the slide off and dump the water.\n•  For all other slides, including the Bb tuning slide (if the horn has a Bb tuning slide), the\ncorresponding valve(s) must be depressed to properly empty the horn.\no  Consult the diagram on the next page for valves and corresponding slides.\no  Failure to properly depress the valves while emptying water does negatively\naffect the sealing on the rotors, and will slowly make the rotors move slower.\n•  Tricks for finding water:\no  Hold down each valve and blow air through the horn. Remember to blow through\nthe valves on the Bb side as well. Any audible gurgle means there is water in that\nparticular slide.\no  A gurgle without any valves depressed means that the water could be in:\nthe main tuning slide\nthe “fake” tuning slide/water slide\nthe F tuning slide\nthe area after all of the valves and before the bell\nv  To empty this section, fully turn the horn clockwise – then point\nthe bell semi-vertically such that water can fall to the ground.\no  To catch any “pesky” water:\n1.  Turn the horn so that the valves are pointed vertically up and the keys are\non the lower side.\n2.  Wiggle all the keys for a few seconds, including the trigger.\n3.  After this, depress the trigger and the 3rd valve.\n4.  Tilt the horn 180° so that the keys are up and the slides are vertical, with\nthe holes pointed down.\n5.  Take out the Bb side 3rd valve.\n6.  Watch as water magically falls out of the horn.\nFrench Horn Diagram\n3rd Valve slide\n(Bb side underneath)\n2nd Valve slide\n1st Valve slide\nBb side underneath\n“Fake” Tuning Slide/Water Slide\nTrigger for Bb Side\n3rd Valve Key\n2nd Valve Key\n1st Valve Key"

The student will\nneed to move to a double horn during the later middle school/early\nhigh school years.\n•  Pitched in both F and Bb\n(cid:1)  For most American double horns, the top set of slides is the F\nside while the bottom set of slides is the Bb side.\n(cid:1)  To use the Bb side, depress the thumb trigger.\n•  The player will read music for Horn in F.\n•  The descant horn will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch.\n•  Tuning notes for the double horn include tuning notes for both sides:\n(cid:1)  Tuning notes for the F side are written middle C and below the\nstaff B, Bb, A and Ab.\n(cid:1)  Tuning notes for the Bb side are written 1st space F, 2nd line E\n•  The double horn is the typical instrument of choice from middle\nschool to the professional level. The combination of the secure high\nrange of the Bb side and the smooth low range of the F side meets\nmost of the needs of the horn player well.\n•  Pitched in Bb and either high F or high Eb.\n(cid:1)  Like the double horn, the top set of slides is the Bb side while\nthe bottom set of slides is either the high F or high Eb side.\n(cid:1)  Like the double horn, depress the trigger to use the high F or\nhigh Eb side.\n•  Tuning notes for the descant horn include tuning notes for each of the\nsides:\n(cid:1)  Tuning for the high F side are written 3rd space C, 3rd line B and\nBb and 2nd line A and Ab.\n(cid:1)  Tuning notes for the high Eb side are written 3rd line Bb, 2nd\nspace A and Ab and 2nd line G and Gb.\n•  The descant horn is used to assist a professional horn player who is\nrequired to play in the high register.\n(cid:1)  The high F or high Eb side provides a more secure high register\nthan the Bb side.\n•  The descant horn is made for professional assistance, not to\ncompensate for technical deficiencies in younger players. As such,\nthis horn should not be used at the secondary level.\n•  Pitched in F, Bb and either high F or high Eb.\n(cid:1)  Just as the double horn, the top set of slides is the F side, the\nmiddle set is the Bb side, and the bottom set is either high F or\nhigh Eb.\n(cid:1)  Like the double horn, depress either the top trigger for the Bb\nside or the bottom trigger for the high F or high Eb side.\n•  The triple horn will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch.\n•  Tuning notes for the triple horn include tuning notes for each of the\nthree sides:\n(cid:1)  Tuning notes for the high F side are written 3rd space C, 3rd line\nB and Bb and 2nd line A and Ab.\n•  The triple horn is essentially a double horn with a descant side. Due to\nspecific compensations in horn construction, each of the sides will not\nsound as resonant as on double horns with the particular sides.\n•  The triple horn provides a more secure high register on the high F or\nhigh Eb side while maintaining the flexibility of range in the other two\nsides.\n•  The triple horn, like the descant horn, is made to assist professional\nplayers, not to compensate for technical deficiencies in younger\nplayers. As such, this horn should not be used at the secondary level.\n•  The Vienna horn comes with a crook mechanism. As such, the player\ncan play in all twelve chromatic keys, using particular crooks\naccording to particular composer directions or particular keys.\n(cid:1)  The most common crook is the F crook, so the horn is most\noften pitched in F.\n•  The player will read music written for horn in any key. The player\nmust read the music for the particular horn key printed.\n(cid:1)  The most common crook is the F crook, so the player will\nusually read music for Horn in F.\n•  As this horn can play in any key via the crook mechanism, its\nsounding pitch will vary according to the crook used.\n(cid:1)  The rule for finding the transposition is, “C’s a C, sounds the\nkey.” This means that a printed C in any octave will produce\nthe key of the crook without any valves depressed.\n(cid:1)  For example, a Vienna horn with an A crook would sound a 2nd\nspace A if the printed note was 3rd space C. As such, the\ntransposition for the A crook would be down a minor 3rd from\nconcert pitch.\n(cid:1)  The most common crook is the F crook, so the Vienna horn will\nsound a perfect 5th lower than concert pitch.\n•  Tuning notes for the Vienna horn will vary according to the crook\nused.\n(cid:1)  The most common crook is the F crook. Tuning notes for the\nVienna horn with an F crook are written middle C and below\nthe staff B, Bb, A and Ab.\n•  While the Vienna horn still uses teardrop keys (like on all other\nhorns), the horn uses the pump valve system. This system is\nessentially a double-piston valve system, where the pistons are\nactivated with long rods attached to the teardrop keys.\n(cid:1)  This system allows for the characteristic smooth legatos and\nslurs heard on the Vienna horn.\n•  The Vienna horn is only used in Vienna, Austria, most famously in\nthe Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.\n•  The Vienna horn will not be used at the secondary level.\n•  Pitched in Bb\n•  The marching horn will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch.\n•  Tuning notes for the marching horn are written 1st space F, 2nd line E\n(cid:1)  The marching horn was not necessarily designed to play in\ntune. Tuning will be a constant issue with this instrument.\n•  The marching horn is one of the two marching band versions of\nFrench horns. This instrument is used in marching band because the\nbell faces toward the front rather than behind (as a normal French\nhorn would).\n•  The fact that the marching horn is pitched in Bb makes it easier and\nmore accurate to play.\n•  Pitched in high F or high Eb\n•  The player will read music for Horn in F or for Horn in Eb.\n•  The mellophone will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch if pitched\nin high F or a major 6th below concert pitch if pitched in high Eb.\n•  Most marching bands will use mellophones pitch in high F.\n•  Tuning notes the mellophone depend on its pitch.\n(cid:1)  Tuning notes for a high F and high Eb mellophone are written\n3rd space C, 3rd line B and Bb and 2nd line A and Ab.\n(cid:1)  For the high F mellophone, these notes are concert F, E, Eb, D\nand Db.\n(cid:1)  For the high Eb mellophone, these notes are concert Eb, D, Db,\nC and B.\n(cid:1)  Like the marching horn, the mellophone was not necessarily\ndesigned to play in tune. Tuning will be a constant issue with\nthis instrument.\n•  The mellophone is the second of the two marching band versions of\n•  The fact that the mellophone is pitched in F gives the player a more\nsecure high register.\nRECOMMENDED FRENCH HORN BRANDS\nBeginner:\nBrand: Conn\nModel: 6D\nPricing: MSRP $3299.00 @ wwbw.com\nDescription:\n•  Brass, more compact and lighter than the\nConn 8D\n•  Durable\n•  Have a tendency to play below pitch center\n•  Very acceptable for beginners\nProfessional:\nModel: 8D\nPricing: MSRP $4349.00 - $4559.00 @\nwwbw.com\n•  Nickel silver large bore horn-typically darker sound with less defined\ngrooves for the notes\n•  Requires more air control and more strength to play\n•  Heavier than other brands\n•  Not recommended for small beginning students or older students that\nhave bad pitch distinction\n•  Very durable\n•  Watch 3rd space C# and 4th line D on this horn.\n(cid:1)  3rd space C# will be terribly flat, and so the 3rd valve on the Bb\nside should barely be pulled out (because G# below and above\nit will be fine with this valve in, and C# is a pretty common\nnote).\n(cid:1)  4th line D is often sharper than the other T12 valve\ncombinations on the horn – sometimes T3 actually puts this\nhorn’s 4th line D in tune.\nBrand: Yamaha\nModel: YHR-667VL\nPricing: MSRP $7636.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  Considered a professional horn\n•  Free blowing\n•  Open wrap\n•  Excellent response and pitch adjustability\n•  Valves and slides are fussy and need to be maintained daily with valve\noil.\n•  Designed to be played in the US and in Europe.\n•  Play above A=440Hz; this is why the slides are so long\n•  Very thin metal, not durable\nModel: YHR-668NII\nPricing: MSRP $4469.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  A little heavier than the Yamaha 667\n•  Thin and not durable metal\n•  Have quick response\nBrand: Holton\nModel: H179 Farkas Series\nPricing: MSRP $4349.00\n•  Nickel silver with bad finish\n•  Valves are mediocre because they are poorly\ndesigned.

This can come in various contours and grips.\n(cid:1)  Flatter rim = better flexibility, rounder rim = better endurance\n(cid:1)  Grip/bite – inside edge of rim. Round = better for thin lips, sharp = better\nfor think lips to ‘grip’ the mouthpiece\no  Cup diameter – the measurement of the diameter of the inside of the rim.\n(cid:1)  Sizes are generally between 16.5 and 18.5mm\n(cid:1)  The size determines how much of the lips can “fit” into the cup.\n(cid:1)  Smaller = better for thinner lips, Larger = better for thick lips\no  Cup shape/depth\n(cid:1)  Two sizes of cups – bowl-shaped and funnel-shaped.\n•  Bowl-shaped cups produce a warmer, rounder sound\n•  Funnel-shaped cups produce a more direct, ringing sound\n(cid:1)  Shallow cups have faster response, better high range flexibility, and more\nfocused sound.\n(cid:1)  Deeper cups have slower response, better low range flexibility, and a\nbroader sound.\no  Bore/backbore\n(cid:1)  The bore is the hole at the end of the cup\n•  Size of the bore determines how free-flowing or resistant the\nmouthpiece is. Smaller = more resistance, Larger = less resistance\n•  Resistance helps with breath control, high range, and accuracy up\nto a point.\n(cid:1)  The backbore is the gradual taper to the bore.\n•  A narrow, straight contour makes for less pitch flexibility and\nmore resistant loud playing, but has a more focused tone.\n•  A rounded contour makes for more pitch flexibility and has less\nresistance at loud dynamics and a darker, broader tone\no  Plating – the metal the mouthpiece is made of.\n(cid:1)  The mouthpiece usually comes in nickel, silver, or gold, but there is not\n(cid:1)\nmuch of a technical difference.\nIf a player has a metal allergy, rims can be made out of plastic such as\nDelrin or Lexan.\nRECOMMENDED\nGenerally, beginners will have thinner, smaller lips, so smaller rims, smaller\ninner cup diameters, moderate cup shape and depth, moderate bore size and a\nmoderate backbore contour will allow them sufficient ease of playing and\nflexibility.\nModel: 30C4\nPricing: MSRP $34.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  Easy response\n•  Good balance between endurance and\nflexibility\n(moderate rim contour)\n•  About halfway point between dark and bright\ntone qualities\nBrand: Schilke\nModel: 30 Silver\nPricing: MSRP $56.00 @ wwbw.com\n•  Produces darker tone sooner\nBrand: Stork\nModel: C8\nPricing: MSRP $60.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  More direct sound (straighter cup shape)\n•  Good flexibility (flatter rim)\nModel: MDC (Medium-Deep Cup)\nPricing: MSRP $59.00 @ wwbw.com\n•  Easy response across the entire range\n•  Small diameter for smaller lips\nPARTS OF THE FRENCH HORN MOUTHPIECE\nGrip/bite\nCup Diameter\nBore (inside)  Backbore\n(inside)\nCup\nRim\nShank\n(outside)\nFRENCH HORN MAINTENANCE KIT LIST –\nRECOMMEND ITEMS\nRotor Oil\nMSRP $3.29 @ interstatemusic.com\n•  This is the oil to be dripped inside the\nslides, as it is a lighter oil.\n•  This oil is to be applied about every\ntwo weeks, or every week for heavy\nplaying.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nRotor Spindle/Bearing Oil\nMSRP $3.98 @ samash.com\n•  This is the oil to be dripped on the tops\nand bottoms of the rotor casings, as it is a\nheavier oil.\n•  This is oil is to be applied about every\nSelmer Tuning Slide & Cork Grease\n•\nMSRP $3.99 @jwpepper.com\nThe Selmer cork grease is a liquid and\nlasts much longer than most tuning slide\ngreases.\nCaution should be used when using this\nbecause it is very sticky\nMust be stored in a plastic Ziploc bag as it\nmay explode.\nIf it hits something in the case or if\nexposed to heat, it will damage other\nmaintenance kit items.\nTo apply, squeeze a tiny bit of the grease\nup and down onto the slide.

Assuring the\ncompany that you will place annual orders\nmay also result in a discount.\n•  Self-portrait mirrors from art supply stores\nare acceptable.\n•  Car clip-on mirrors are not recommended\nbecause they are too small and the hinges\nbreak easily.\n•  Makeup mirrors are not recommended\nbecause they are too small and oddly\nshaped.\nIt would be best if there was a box for the\nmirrors in each separate class location.\nStudents can then easily obtain a mirror out\nof the box before class and return the mirror\nafter class.\nFRENCH HORN MAINTENANCE KIT –\nOPTIONAL RECOMMENDED ITEMS\nOne of the following can be used depending on socio-economic environment, availability, or\npreference when selecting a suitable metronome.\nQwik Time QT-5 Metronome\nMSRP $7.95 @ wwbw.com\n•  This metronome does not have a\nsubdivision function.\n•  Credit card-sized\n•  A-440 tuning tone\n•  Low-battery indicator\nKorg MA-1 Metronome\nMSRP $24.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  Beat-Counting display makes it easier to\npractice rhythm and phrasing.\n•  Tap Tempo function makes it easier to\nquickly set the desired tempo.\n•  Beat display offers from 1 to 9 beats, plus\n8 rhythm types to practice any style of\nmusic.\n•  Can tune any instrument using the 12-step\n(C4 – B4) chromatic reference pitch\n•  Adjustable calibration setting (410 – 480\nHz)\n•  Earphone jack with adjustable volume\n•  Memory backup function and auto\npower-off function\n•  Up to approximately 290 hours of\ncontinuous operation\nKorg TM-50 Digital Tuner/ Metronome\nMSRP $29.99 @ wwbw.com\n•  Offers both a tuner and metronome,\nwhich function simultaneously or\nindependently\n•  Contains 13 types of rhythms that cover\n0-7 beats per measure as well as doublets,\ntriplets, triplets with center beats omitted,\nquadruplets, and quadruplets with center\nbeats omitted\n•  Tempo is easily adjustable in a range of\n40—208BPM.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nOne of the following music stands can be chosen depending on socio-economic environment,\navailability, or preference.\nHamilton Folding Music Stand\nMSRP $10.79 @ wwbw.com\n•  Collapsible and easy to transport\nSelmer Music Stand with Bag\nMSRP $26.95 @ wwbw.com\nFrench Horn String\nMSRP $3.99\n•  This string is only for French horns without\nmetal linkages for the valves.\n•  The method for tying this string can be found\nonline or in The Art of French Horn Playing.\nPolishing Cloth\nMSRP $7.95\n•  This cloth must be made for silver or gold\nplating, depending on the appropriate\nplating of the horn.\n•  This cloth wipes off any acid from\nfingerprint residue in addition to keeping a\ngenerally polished look to the horn.\nHetman 7 or 8 – Premium Slide Grease\nStandard\nMSRP $9.00 @ wwbw.com\n•  The Hetman Slide Grease is a cream and\n•  Caution should be used when using this\n•  To apply, remove a small amount of cream\nfrom container and smear onto slide.

Take a mouthpiece brush and run it through the mouthpiece under warm\nwater in the sink.\n(cid:1)  The brush will not go all the way through, so insert the brush\nthrough both ends to fully clean each end.\n(cid:1)  Soap is not necessary, but it does not hurt the mouthpiece to use it.\nThe same goes for mouthwash. If these are used, simply rinse the\nmouthpiece thoroughly afterwards and let it air dry so that the\nalcohol evaporates.\n•  This process should be done every week to two weeks.\nSlide Maintenance\n•  The insides of the slides and various tubes build up grime, various dirt particles,\nand germs, so the slides must be snaked at least once a month.\n•  To snake a horn:\n1.  Take out the appropriate slide, pressing down the appropriate valve while\ntaking it out, and place the slide on a towel or soft surface.\n2.  Run water through the unattached slide, preferably in the opposite\ndirection of air flow.\nIn the case of the main tuning slide and the lead pipe, also run\nwater through the lead pipe – starting on the end with the tuning\nslide, not the end with the mouthpiece receiver.\n3.  Take the snake and run it through the slide which was taken out,\npreferably in the opposite direction of air flow.\n4.  Repeat the above step on the immovable part of the slide attached to the\nrotor. Be careful to not jam the snake against the rotor.\n5.  Repeat the above two steps with all slides, including the main tuning slide,\nthe F tuning slide and the Bb tuning slide.\n6.  Apply slide grease as necessary according to the below steps.\n•  There are numerous slides on the French horn. Each of these must be well-\nlubricated with slide grease. Refer to the “Maintenance Kit” handout for pictures\nof slide greases.\n•  To apply the grease:\n1.  Take out the slide to be greased, pressing down the appropriate valve.\n2.  With a paper towel, wipe off the slide to clean the grease and any grime on\nthe slide.\n3.  If the grease is a liquid, squeeze the bottle and apply a line of grease down\ntwo sides of the slide. If the grease is more of a cream, use the index finger\nto apply the grease along most of the length of the slide.\n(cid:1)  Do not apply too much grease, as the slides can become too\nlubricated and fall out.\n4.  Re-insert the slide and slide it fully in and out a few times. Insert only one\nside of the slide in and rotate the slide while moving it in and out. Press\ndown the appropriate valve the entire time during this process.\n5.  Push the slide all the way in and use a paper towel to wipe off any extra\ngrease located where the immovable and movable parts of the slide meet.\n6.  Repeat this process for all slides as needed – even fake tuning slides.\n•  This process should be done every month or so.\nValve Maintenance\n•  With a Holton French horn, you will have to constantly apply oil to the valves.\n•  Oil all the moving parts.  Oil is like most wonderful things…you cannot have too\nmuch!\n•  Put oil on the springs, under the valve cap, and inside the slides to keep the oil\nfrom mixing with slide grease and slowing down the valve.  Then move the slide\nin and out while pressing on the corresponding valve. Make sure that your\nstudents routinely depress the keys when emptying their slides.\n•  There are two types of rotary oil – rotor oil and rotor spindle/bearing oil. Rotor oil\nlooks like normal valve oil, whereas spindle oil has a “needle-looking” thing.\nRotor oil goes in the slides to lubricate the outside of the rotor casing.\nSpindle/bearing oil goes under the valve caps, such that the raised portion is\ncovered in a small dome of oil. It also goes on the underside, inside of a crevice\nbetween the middle vertical screw and the bumpers. The spindle/bearing oil\nlubricates the interior mechanism of the rotor. It is wise to not mix these up, as the\ntwo oils have different thicknesses (and rotors do not like it when they have the\nwrong oil).\n•  On some horns, there are strings connecting the components of the rotary valves.\nThese strings will break on occasion, and they can be an ordeal to tie – especially\nif the student or director is inexperienced.

Identify these marks,\nand their relationship to the top and bottom of the case.  Most cases have the handles\nplaced on the bottom section of each case.  Check to make sure.\n•  Place all French horn cases on the floor in front of the student.\n•  Be sure the student understands where and which direction each part of the\ninstrument belongs in the case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from\nthe case.  Make sure the student waits for each instruction before performing the\ntask.  Be sure the parts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse order\nthey were removed.\n•  The French horn should be removed first, followed by the mouthpiece.  When putting\nthe instrument back, the order is reversed – mouthpiece first, followed by the French\nhorn.\n•  All instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure\nexplicitly every time.\n•  Never leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up, but this\nis not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.  Check each\nopening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to your students.\n•  Cases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom setup\nfor each student’s case.  If using an ensemble room for the class, the cases may be\nopened in the hall.  The empty case will remain closed and latched in the hall during\nclass.\n•  When instruments are in their cases, do not allow students to sit on their cases AT\nANY TIME because the lead pipe and/or bell will get bent.\nSpecific Information about Removing the French Horn from Its Case\n•  Open the case fully before removing the French horn. Some cases may not open such\nthat both sides are on the floor. For these cases, one side will stay up and possibly fall\non the horn while removing it from the case.\n•  When possible, remove the French horn by gripping the main pipe running between\nall the valves and slides. This is the sturdiest part of the instrument. Do not grip the\nhorn by the bell, as the bell contains some of the thinner layers of metal on the\ninstrument.\nFRENCH HORN SLIDES\nMain Tuning Slide – The main tuning slide is the first slide on the horn.  It is located on the\nback side of the horn.  This slide affects the pitch of both sides of the horn (F and B-flat).\nF Tuning Slide – Double horns will have an additional slide on the back of the horn, the F\nTuning Slide that only affects the F side of the horn (without the trigger).  The main tuning slide\nshould be set first before setting this slide.  On a Kruspe wrap horn (more open wrap) the main\ntuning slide and F tuning slide will face in opposite directions.  On a Geyer wrap horn (tighter\nwrap = brighter sound) these slides will face the same direction. (see pictures below)\nExamples of Kruspe wrap horns: Conn 8D, Yamaha 668, Yamaha 668II, Conn 6D, Holton 179\nExample of a Geyer wrap horn: Yamaha 667\n“Fake” Tuning Slide – Many horns will have a fake tuning slide located on the front side of the\nhorn, near the mouthpiece.  This slide is used to empty water that collects in the horn – not for\ntuning purposes. This is the only slide on the horn that should be pushed in almost all the way.\nB-flat Tuning Slide – Some horns will also have a B-flat tuning slide which only affects the\npitch of the B-flat side of the horn (with the trigger).  This is a short slide that is located on the\nfront of the horn, in line with the valve slides.  It should be pulled about ¼ of an inch and then\nleft alone.  Adjustments to the B-flat side of the horn should be done with the main tuning slide.\nValve Slides – Each valve has its own tuning slide.  The F side valve slides are located in front,\nand the B-flat valve slides are the smaller ones located behind.  The valve slides should be set\napproximately equidistant with each other.  The F side slides should be pulled about ¼-3/8 of an\ninch.  The B-flat side slides should be pushed in slightly more than the F side slides because it is\na shorter horn.  The 1st and 2nd valve slides can be pulled out very slightly more to help\ncompensate for the sharp 1-2 valve combination, and the 3rd valve can be pushed in very slightly\nmore to help compensate for the flat 2-3 valve combination, especially on the Conn 8Ds. The Bb\nside 3rd valve needs to be barely out on the Conn 8D horns (as noted in the “Setting Slides”\nhandout) because of 3rd space C#, which is very flat.\nKRUSPE\nGEYER\nF Tuning Slide\nCONN 8D\nYAMAHA 668\nFake Tuning Slide\nMain Tuning Slide\nYAMAHA 668II\nCONN 6D\nHOLTON H179\nYAMAHA 667\nThe trigger valve casing is\nlocated on the far end of\nthe horn.

Move the instrument up and down, side to side, higher than usual\nand lower than usual.  As students are doing this, have them notice how it affects the\nbalance of the body.  Eventually, the body should feel as balanced with or without the\ninstrument in hand.\n•  Make sure students bring instruments to them… and not them to the instruments.\nWhen done incorrectly, their body collapses and their air is obstructed.\n•  Shoulders should be straight across when facing the director and it should feel the\nsame way when doing breathing exercises  (do not twist or shift the upper body out of\nthe breathing position)\n•  The French horn should not be slanted in a manner in which moves the students’ head\nfrom its natural position.\n•  Angles of mouthpieces should be slightly lower than level.\n•  Although single F horns are lighter and easier for students to control in the\nbeginning stages of playing, it is suggested that beginning French horn students\nare started on double horns. Of course, this decision may be dictated by what\ninstruments are available in your inventory.\nHand Position\n1.  The most natural shape of everyone’s hands forms a flat “C”.\n2.  All hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall behind the\nwrist.\n3.  There should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the French horn.\n4.  The inside of the arm must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding\nthe French horn correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\n5.  Elbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be\nhampered.\n6.  Place both the left and the right hand in their correct “beginner” position.  The left\nhand is placed on the valves and will lie in the “flat-C” position.  No tension should\nbe felt in this hand, as the fingers move “with” the valves.\n7.  The right hand will be cupped on the outer ridge of the bottom of the bell.  Both\nhands hold and balance the French horn in the beginning.  The horn does not rest on\nthe leg.  The right hand is not placed inside the bell until the teacher determines that\nthe student can balance the horn in this manner.  An added bonus to holding the\nFrench horn by the bottom of the bell will result in the student being able to hear—\nand expect to hear—a more resonant sound when the hand is finally in its\ncorrect/more advanced position inside the bell.\n8.  Though not a part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling\nthe instrument toward the student’s face.  Instruct students to keep their elbows soft\nwhile playing the French horn.\n9.  The palms of both hands should feel soft.\n10. The teacher must watch young students closely to monitor that their shoulders stay\nbalanced and feel naturally soft at all times.\nFRENCH HORN FACE/EMBOUCHURE\n•  Each student should use their own “safe/unbreakable” mirror—both in the\nclassroom and at home.\n•  Using the mirror, have each student notice how natural their face looks.  They will\nhave to later remember and memorize how it looks and feels.\n•  The head must be balanced on the shoulders in a comfortable position—not too\nfar forward and not too far backward.\n•  The eyes should be soft and natural, and the “sight line” should be exactly level.\nThe distance between eyebrows should not change as air goes in and out of the\nbody.\n•  Look for natural creases in the face, and allow any that are naturally present to\nexist while playing.  No other creases are allowed.\n•  The corners should move in toward the canine/eye teeth.  The corners should\nnever look or feel pulled back.\n•  The corners can move down from the natural position as the student progresses\nbut they can never move up.\n•  The texture of both the upper and lower lip should be very soft and relaxed.\n•  There should be natural space between the inside of the lips and the gums and\nteeth.  This space should not change or feel different when the lips vibrate inside\nthe cup of the mouthpiece.  Please remember the demonstration given in today’s\npresentation.\n•  The back teeth are slightly apart and should feel the same as when the student is\nreading, watching television, etc.  The teeth should not be pressed into each other\nwhen doing these other activities.\n•  Brass instrument embouchures are formed with a natural overbite.  A student with\nan underbite should be steered away from brass instrument.\n•  The thickness of a student’s lips should correspond to the size of the cup of the\nmouthpiece for the chosen instrument.  Students with a very full top or bottom lip\nshould be steered towards low brass instruments rather than French horn.\n•  The bottom of the front of the tongue should lie in the soft tissue area which is\nlocated in the front of the mouth just behind the ridge of the bottom gum.\n•  Remember that when playing the French horn, cheeks will only “puff out” if\nthe air is not freely going into the instrument.\n•  Assuming that the above has been achieved, the embouchure will be formed with\nspecial attention to the following:\n1.  The mouthpiece must be placed in the middle of the mouth—up and\ndown as well as side to side. Two-thirds upper lip and one-third\nbottom lip is also a good rule of thumb if some have trouble with\nplacing the mouthpiece in the middle of the mouth.\n2.  The corners are in their natural position and should be set against the\ncanine/eye teeth.\n3.  The lips must be allowed to freely vibrate in response to the airstream\nrather than made to “buzz” in front of the airstream.\n4.  The lips must feel natural so that air can freely move past them—they\nmust not be pulled back against the teeth or blown away from the teeth\nand gums.\n5.  The students should remember that the mouthpiece “gathers” the air—\nnot the lips.\n6.  There must never be more energy placed against the upper lip than the\nlower lip; hence when playing the French horn, the student will\nslightly turn their head to the left so the leadpipe appears to angle\nslightly downwards from the embouchure. There is a simple trick for\nsetting the mouthpiece angle:\na.  Take the mouthpiece, attached to the leadpipe, and set it\nagainst the teeth.\nb.  Allow the rim to sit so that it hits both upper and lower teeth\nnaturally.\nc.  Wherever this angle is, this is the “default” playing angle for\nthat student (as this is how air will naturally proceed from their\nmouth in the middle register).\n7.  Students must be taught to play “down into the French horn” with the\nbell to the side of the body as it was meant to be played—instead of at\nthe mouthpiece with the bell of the horn into the stomach.\n8.  Regarding playing “off the leg,” or with the bell raised up from the\nleg: this technique is useful for students as they grow taller, as these\nstudents may have to otherwise contort their backs or compromise\nlung capacity to play on the leg. Rather than playing with the bell on\nthe thigh, the right hand bears some of the weight of the horn while\nplaying off the leg. Special attention to upper lip/lower lip pressure is\nneeded when doing this adjustment, as the student may be tempted to\nput extra pressure on the upper lip at first.\nFRENCH HORN ARTICULATION\n•  The tongue moves in the same manner when articulating a brass instrument as it\ndoes when you speak.  The tongue moves up and down—not back and forth—\nboth when speaking and when articulation on an instrument.\n•  The purpose of the tongue is to release the air, which causes the lips to vibrate and\ncreates the sound. The tongue’s release of the air simply defines the\nbeginning/start of the vibration/sound.\n•  Articulation is used to define the vibrations necessary to create musical rhythm,\nstyle and movement-- to contrast the use of slurring (which also creates similar\nmusical entities).\n•  The students should think that the tongue “articulates” the sound created by the\nairstream.  If the student is taught to create the sound correctly, articulation will\nbe an easy transition.\na.  Sound occurs when the air moves past the naturally vibrating\nlips.\nb.  Articulate the sound that is already present.\nc.  Teach students to articulate at the moment the sound begins.\n•  Without the instrument or mouthpiece, use the following procedure:\n1.   Say the word “DOG”.\n2.  Sing the syllable “DAH”.\n3.  Once these are mastered, have the student use the mouthpiece and\ninstrument and reproduce the “DAH” syllable in their brain to create\nan articulated sound.\n4.  The tongue should feel the same when saying, singing and playing the\nmouthpiece and instrument.\n5.  The tongue should touch the enamel of the upper teeth directly below\nthe gum line—in the same spot with the same strength every time.\n6.  Use the syllable “DAH” because it creates smoother and more easily\ncontrolled air as opposed to the “TAH” syllable.\n7.  After each “articulation”, the tongue must immediately fall down into\nits natural position.\n8.  The tongue will be naturally soft at all times, but can touch the teeth\nwith different strengths.\n9.  The tongue will be in its “down position” 98% of the time when\narticulating correctly.\n10. The French horn requires a warmer and “darker” airstream than the\ntrumpet.\n•  Have the student start their sound with the air.\n•  Using the information about the basics of articulation, have the student articulate\nas fast as they can with no limitations of numbers, worries about evenness of\narticulation, etc.  Simply get them used to articulating!\n•  Have the student then use the “ta-day” syllable to practice using the tongue in an\norganized manner.\n•  Have the student then articulate “on command.”  The student will start their\nsound, and articulate when you snap your fingers to practice gaining more control\nof the tongue.\n•  Once the student understands pulse and the foot pat, have the student articulate\nexactly when the toe of the foot touches the floor.\n•  Have the student articulate with the down and up position of the foot. Proceed to\nwritten rhythms as they begin to read music.\n•  Always practice this entire routine.  The student must always go through the\nentire process, so he will not lose the ability to move his tongue at various\nspeeds and in unstructured manners.\n•  Advanced technique for low register (around 2nd space C in bass clef): move the\ntongue lower, toward the bottom of the top teeth. If the articulation is generally\nunclear in the lower/pedal register, this technique does wonders to “clean up” the\narticulation.\n•  Advanced technique for muted playing: articulate way firmer. The articulation\nneeds to be far more defined to compensate for the straight mute placed in the bell\n– and not quite as firm an articulation for stopped horn playing.\nFRENCH HORN FLEXIBILITY AND RANGE\nEXTENSTION\n•  Brass playing is based upon flexibility.\n•  There are two types of flexibility: flexibility within the instrument and flexibility\nwithin the note.\n•  Students eventually need to be flexible through each of the harmonic series in\norder to move up and down within the range of the instrument.\n•  Once the student can reproduce at will a given pitch, the teacher must decide\nwhether flexibility up or down is needed first.\n•  Flexibility is controlled by air direction and the isometrics created by the corners\nand canine/eye teeth.  The head must always stay in its natural, balanced position\nat all times.  The angle of the instrument must not change at any time…exception\nbeing possibly in the extreme low register (below 2nd space C) and the high\nregister (above G on top of the treble clef staff). Many professional horn players\naround the world recommend angle changes in these registers if there are sound\nproduction problems. This is a technique to use with very advanced high school\nplayers, but not with middle school/junior high students.\n•  Students must learn to angle the air in the cup of the mouthpiece without changing\nthe position of the lips and/or the relationship of the upper and lower teeth.\nFlexibility is also enhanced by vowel sounds used in various registers.  These\nsounds can be “ah” for the middle register….”ee” for the upper register….and\n“oh” for the lower register.  Have students practice saying these vowel sounds\nwith vocalization on appropriate lower, middle and higher sounds.\n(cid:1)  “Ee” starts around 3rd space C.\n(cid:1)  “Ah” is used from middle C to 3rd space C.\n(cid:1)  “Oh” starts in the range from around middle C to below the staff A.\n(cid:1)  “Ooh” can be used in the low register (2nd space C in the bass clef).\nThe “ooh” vowel shape corrects sharp pitch tendencies, tight tone\nquality, and inability to produce notes in this register.\n(cid:1)  “Howaii” – that is, “Hoh” + “wah” + “ee” – takes students through\neach vowel sound. It is also very similar to “Hawaii”, making it easy\nto remember.\n•  Bring to the students’ attention that the shape of the tongue changes dramatically\nfrom vowel sound to vowel sound.  All students should be aware that vowel\nsounds are the middles of words that they speak every day.  Practice saying words\nthat use the required vowel sounds. (i.e.  bow, ball, beep) As students move\nbetween vowel sounds, remind them to keep their throats relaxed. As they ascend,\nthere may be a tendency to close the throat while saying “ee.” This is\ncounterproductive to playing high; therefore, students should be blowing with a\nrelaxed body.  The oral cavity and the lips are the only things that should change.\n•  Range is developed through flexibility.  It is more important to create a resonant\nsound while practicing flexibility than to create wider intervals.  The student can\nenhance their range by making more resonant sounds in the middle register before\ntrying to extend higher or lower.\n•  Make sure students understand the texture of the lips has nothing to do with\nrange.  For example, students should never be told to “tighten” their lips in order\nto play in the higher register. The shape of the lips remains the same throughout\nall registers; therefore, students should not smile in the high register.\n•  All basic fundamentals for teaching brass instruments hold true for the French\nhorn.  Remember the harmonics on the French horn are much closer than on the\ntrumpet.  Flexibility is actually easier to achieve on the French horn, but accuracy\nis more difficult.  Do not be too demanding in the very beginning in regards to\naccuracy.\n(cid:1)  Start asking beginning students what note they think they are playing.\nThis will be more easily accomplished after having them sing some\nbasic/simple passages. There must be an awareness of where the\nstudents are playing on the harmonic series of the horn.\n(cid:1)  A big problem with younger students is being unable to tell that they\nare on the incorrect harmonic while playing. Again, this is to build\nawareness and not necessarily to demand accuracy.\n•  As students descend, there is a common tendency to run out of air because they\nare not used to blowing all the way through the instrument. This will start\nhappening around 4th line F in the bass clef. Students must blow large amounts of\nslow, hot air. Sometimes they try blowing a lot of air…but it comes out too fast\nbecause they are blowing too hard.\nFRENCH HORN GENERAL\nTUNING TENDENCIES\nThe Harmonic Series\n•  The harmonic series is the set of notes that can be played on one finger\ncombination.\n•  Here is the harmonic series for open (no valves pressed):\n+2\n+4\n+2  +41\n-14\n-32\n-14  -49\n-12\n•  On the French horn, there is one harmonic series for each valve combination on\nboth the F and Bb sides to make a total of 12 different harmonic series.\n•  Each harmonic series has similar pitch tendencies as the ones listed on this\ndiagram. Transpose the series up or down depending on the valve combination:\no  T0: Up a perfect fourth (starts on F below the bass clef)\no  T2: Up a major third (starts on E below the bass clef)\no  T1: Up a minor third (starts on Eb below the bass clef)\no  T12: Up a major second (starts on D below the bass clef)\no  T23: Up a minor second (starts on Db below the bass clef)\no  2: Down a minor second (starts on B below the bass clef)\no  1: Down a major second (starts on Bb below the bass clef)\no  12: Down a minor third (starts on A below the bass clef)\no  23: Down a major third (starts on Ab below the bass clef)\no  13: Down a perfect fourth (starts on G below the bass clef)\no  123: Down a tritone (starts on Gb below the bass clef)\n•  To remedy pitch problems as listed on the diagram:\no  Adjust the vowel shape\no  Adjust the right hand\no  Use a different fingering\nIn addition to the above general harmonic tendencies of the horn, the following\nnotes have additional tuning issues associated with them. A number refers to a\nparticular valve. A “0” refers to open or no valves depressed.\nSharp Notes\n• Moderately sharp\n• Very sharp\n• More open “ah” vowel\n• Use open “ooh” vowel\n• Can use 3 to flatten pitch\n• Slightly sharp\n• More open “oh” vowel\n• Can use T3 to flatten pitch\n• Use open “ah” vowel\n• Very sharp on Conn 8D\n• Use open “ee” vowel\nIgnore this for Conn 8D\n• Can use T2, but may be too flat\nFlat Notes\n• Moderately flat\n• Use taller “ah” vowel\n• Very flat on Conn 8D\n• Push in T3 valve slide almost all\nthe way in because of this note\n• Moderately to very flat if\nT2 is used\n• Use taller “ee” vowel\nT0 is used\nGeneral Tendencies\n•  As shown above, the valve combinations 12, 23, 13, 123, T12, and T23 all\ngenerally produce sharp notes on the horn.\n•  For some notes with these fingerings, alternate fingerings can be used to alleviate\npitch problems. With others of these fingerings, a combination of vowel\nplacement and right hand tuning must be used to compensate for these fingerings.\nFRENCH HORN TUNING AND\nSETTING FRENCH HORN SLIDES\n1.  You must know what kind of horn the student is playing because the number of\ntuning slides varies.\n2.  Do not tune just one note.  The placement for each note can vary.  Tuning just one\nnote will not give you an accurate slide setting.\n3.  Slide settings do matter, but not as much as playing fundamentals.  If a student is\nvibrating the wrong note on the mouthpiece, the sound can be incorrect in a\nnumber of different ways.\nInaccurate or inconsistent hand placement\nInaccurate or inconsistent slide placement\nCommon Mistakes Regarding French Horn Tuning\n•  Pulling the wrong slide\n•  Pulling a slide for the wrong reason\n•  Wrong ratio of tuning slides to one another\nWill the correct slide please stand up…?\n•  There are three kinds of tuning slides on horn:\n(cid:1)  F side\n(cid:1)  Bb side\n(cid:1)  Combination or main slide\n•  The top stack of valve slides is the F side; the bottom stack is the Bb side.  Single-\nsided horns only have one stack.\n•  The water slide on the front and closest to the player is an imposter; this slide should\nbe pushed almost all the way in all the time.\n•  All tuning slides should be pulled about the same amount and be in equal ratio with\neach other.\nHOLTON FARKAS H179\n•  The main slide is on the top but in the back (while on the lap).\n•  The Bb tuning slide is sideways in the front.\n•  The F tuning slide is the bottom slide on the back.\n•  The front vertical slide is a fake tuning slide.  This slide is used for emptying water\nand does not affect tuning.\n•  All valve slides should be pulled about ¼ of an inch.\n•  The fake/wannabe water slide is on the front (from the student’s point of view).\n•  The main slide is on the top in the back.\n•  The F slide is on the bottom in the back.\n•  The 3rd valve slide on Bb side should be pulled out a tiny amount – enough so it does\nnot become stuck, but not enough to affect tuning. 3rd space C#’s are noticeably flat\non this horn, and the other T23 and T3 valve combinations will be fine despite this\nadjustment.\n•  The Bb and F slides are side by side on the back.\nOther Brands\n•  Take out the slide in question. Play a note without the trigger.  If you hear a note\nrather than a mystery sound, the F side does not use that tuning slide.  Play a note\nwith the trigger. If you hear a note rather than a mystery sound, the Bb side does not\nuse that tuning slide.\nSetting French Horn Slides\nIt is important to set French horn slides early.  Setting horn slides helps to establish\npitch center.  Do not “tune” the slides – just set the slides. At first, beginners will not\nhave a correct pitch center, so tuning the slides is useless. Additionally, there is an\nextensive tuning process for tuning each slide.\n•  At first, all slides should be pulled out ¼ inch (even the fake/wannabe water slide).\nFrench horns are made to be in tune with the slides out, and this will keep the slides\nfrom becoming stuck.\n•  As students become more advanced, slides can be individually tuned.\n•  The 1st, 2nd and 3rd valve tuning slides should be pulled out equidistantly on the F side\nof the horn.\nThe C Major Scale: Tuning the Horn from Middle C to 5th line F\nTuning the F Side (no trigger)\n•  Have the student play the first five notes from first ledger line below the staff C to\nsecond line G.  Eye ball the entire part of the scale.  This generally tunes the F side of\nthe horn.  Set the tuner to first line E and second line G.  All concert F’s should be in\ntune on the F side.\n•  To tune the 1st, 2nd and 3rd valve slides on the F side, descend chromatically from\nmiddle C. Below the staff B and Bb should be in tune (via the 1st and 2nd valves on\nthe F side, respectively), and below the staff Ab can somewhat tune the 3rd valve after\ntuning the 2nd valve with below the staff B.\nTuning the Bb side (trigger)\n•  Have the student play second line G to third space C.  This generally tunes the Bb\n(trigger) side of the horn.  You are really looking at the 3rd space C. (If C and G are in\ntune but A and B are out of tune, adjust the second valve slide.)\n•  To tune the 1st, 2nd and 3rd valve slides on the Bb side, descend chromatically from 1st\nspace F (which should be in tune). 1st line E and Eb should in tune (via the 1st and 2nd\nvalves on the Bb side, respectively). Use below the staff Db to tune the 3rd valve after\ntuning the 2nd valve, although the note should stand slightly out of tune.\nHave the student play 3rd space C to 5th line F.  Eye ball the entire part of the scale.  You\nare really looking at the C and the F.  (If the D and E are out of tune, adjust the bottom\nfirst or second valve slide.) Like the octave below, this is supposed to be the “in-tune”\nharmonic; however, students may have trouble playing with proper vowel shapes in this\nregister.\nFRENCH HORN – ADVANCED TECHNIQUES\nFOR FRENCH HORN\n•  There are numerous techniques beyond range, flexibility, articulation, and other\nfundamentals that are vital to playing literature for more mature horn players, such as a\nfair amount of works for high school band.\nRight Hand Technique\n•  After the beginner year, the right hand player must be placed into the bell for proper tone\nquality and tuning.\n•  To create the create the correct right hand shape:\n1.  Take the right hand and hold it out like shaking a person’s hand.\n2.  Bring all the fingers together so they are touching each other then let the thumb\nrest on top of the index finger.\n3.  Keeping a relaxed hand, put this right hand into the bell so that the knuckles are\ntouching the far side of the bell and line up to where the bell begins to flare.\na.  Depending on the teacher’s preference, the index finger can be anywhere\nfrom a “12 o’ clock” to a “10 o’ clock” position in the bell.\n4.  The hand should be straight, while the wrist, elbow and shoulder should be\nrelaxed and free of tension.\na.  The wrist can be bent or straight depending on the needs of the student.\n•  The hand must not be cupped while in the bell, as this will produce a muffled sound.\nIndividual students will need to adjust how far in the hand must be and how much to\nturn their hand according to body size, tuning, and tone quality.\no  A noticeably sharp, bright sound means that the hand is too far out.\no  A noticeably flat, muffled sound means that the hand is too far in.\no  A muffled sound may also mean that the hand is too cupped.\nTransposition\n•  Transposition is the process involved while playing a horn part written for a horn not in\nthe key of F (ex. Horn in C, Dvorak Symphony No. 9, mvt.1, Horns 3 and 4).\no  The general rule is: C’s a C, sounds the key. This means that a written C on any\npart will sound the key of the instrument playing that part.\n(cid:1)  Ex. A written C for clarinet in A sounds an A on the piano and other non-\ntransposing instruments.\no  Remember, the transposition is from the printed “Horn in _” key to Horn in F.\no  A little trick to find the transposition interval is to find the closest interval\nbetween Horn in F and the printed horn key. This is the interval and direction for\nthe transposition.\n(cid:1)  Ex. The music has printed “Horn in A.” The interval between Horn in F\nand Horn in A is an ascending major third, so one would play a major\nthird up from the printed notes.\no  The most common keys or transpositions are Horn in E and Horn in Eb.\n(cid:1)  To transpose Horn in E, play a half-step lower than printed.\n(cid:2)  Ex. A written 3rd line B-natural would be played as a Bb/A#.\n(cid:1)  To transpose Horn in Eb, play a whole-step lower than written.\n(cid:2)  Ex. A written 5th line F would be played as a(n) Eb/D#.\n(cid:1)  As exercises, have students transpose short segments of a familiar slow\npiece at first. The familiarity will allow them to use their ear to help\ndetermine if their transposition is correct.\n(cid:1)  Then, lengthen the selection of pieces and include faster pieces. After this,\ninclude pieces in various meters and with accidentals.\n(cid:1)  A common mistake when transposing is forgetting accidentals and key\nsignatures. These must be accounted for when transposing a part.\n(cid:1)  Do not allow students to write in transposed note names. This skill is\nsight-transposing, and this crutch may hinder students’ progress in\nlearning to properly transpose.\n(cid:1)  This is a skill that requires dedication, persistence, and drill. A little daily\npractice…even 2 minutes…will improve the skill.\nMuted Horn\n•  Muted horn is called for by a variety of directions, but always involved putting a straight\nmute into the bell of the horn.\no  There is no hand alternative to this technique, so a string or other mechanism for\nholding the mute by hanging at the wrist is vital for quick mute changes.\n•  Musical directions for muted horn:\no  “Mute” vs. “Open”\n(cid:1)  English pieces/contemporary pieces\n(cid:1)  “Mute” denotes a section to be played with the mute in.\n(cid:1)  “Open” denotes a section to be played with the mute out.\no  Mit Dampfer vs. ohne Dampfer\n(cid:1)  German composers\n(cid:1)  Mit Dampfer means “with dampener” or with the mute in.\n(cid:1)  Ohne Dampfer means “without dampener” or with the mute out.\no  Con sordino vs. senza sordino\n(cid:1)  Con sordino denotes to play with the mute in.\n(cid:1)  Senza sordino denotes to play with the mute out.\n(cid:1)  As very common directions, these can be abbreviated to con sord. and\nsenza sord.\no  For all of these directions, they each denote a section of music to played\naccordingly, like tempo or style directions.\n•  To play effectively, the player must put more air into their sound and horn, regardless of\nthe dynamic. At all dynamics above piano, there must be a slight buzz to the sound.\nStopped Horn\n•  Stopped horn, called for via various directions in the part, is accomplished in one of two\nways:\n1.  Muting the horn with a stop mute\n(cid:1)  This is simple: stick the stop mute in the bell of the horn like a straight\nmute, ensuring that the hole is completely sealed. The seal is open if there\nis an airy sound or leak.\n(cid:1)  This is easier to produce the desired sound, especially in the lower\nIt takes some time to move the mute in and out of the horn, so a string\nshould be tied to the mute.\nIf the mute change is too fast in the music, the player must hand mute the\n2.  Muting the horn by fully closing the bell bore with the hand\n(cid:1)  To hand-mute the horn, simply collapse the wrist of the right hand to seal\nthe opposite wall as the fingers. Rotate or adjust the fingers or wrist to\ncompletely seal the horn.\n(cid:1)  Again, an airy, muffled or diffuse (lacking in support) sound reveals an\nincomplete seal in the hand.\n(cid:1)  This is the technique favored by professionals, and it does not require an\nadditional mute.\n(cid:1)  This is the best stopped horn technique for quick mute changes.\nIn both cases, the player must blow a noticeably larger amount of air – like playing a\nnormal forte or fortissimo – such that the player produces a buzzy or brassy sound.\no  This is more difficult as one descends the range of the horn – it is difficult just\nbelow the staff, and quite difficult near low C (2nd space C in bass clef).\nIn both cases, the section to be stopped must be transposed like Horn in E – played a half-\nstep lower than written, on the F side.\no  For a few notes, this transposition will not produce the correct note or play close\nto “in-tune.” On these notes (which are different on each horn), experiment to find\na fingering which will play the note “in-tune.”\no  Remember, play a half-step lower on the F side, even above 2nd line G.\n•  Music directions for stopped horn:\no  (+) = stopped, (o) = open\n(cid:1)  This is a common direction in newer music and simple to remember.\nIn this system, there are usually +’s over each note to be stopped, and a\nsingle “o” to end the stopped horn direction.\no  Gestopft vs. Offen\n(cid:1)  Gestopft denotes stopped\n(cid:1)  Offen denotes open\n(cid:1)  For these directions, the word will be printed above the beginning of the\nsection to be stopped or opened.\n(cid:1)  Until the next gestopft or offen direction, the music is played according to\nthe last direction given.\n(cid:1)  This is the common system used by German composers, such as Wagner\nand Mahler.\no  Bouché cuivré vs. Ouvert\n(cid:1)  Bouché cuivré denotes stopped horn.\nIt may sometimes be denoted as just cuivré (closed) or, mistakenly,\nas bouché (brassy). If the music only notes bouché, check previous\nrecordings to see if the direction is for stopped horn or just a loud,\nbrassy sound.\n(cid:1)  Ouvert or a similar-looking word denotes open.\n(cid:1)  This system works the same as the German system for stopped horn\ndirections.\nReading Bass Clef\n•  All French horn players should be proficient in reading both treble and bass clef,\nparticularly 2nd and 4th horn players.\n•  Older pieces (generally those written before 1880-1900) that are not edited to modern\nnotation will have bass clef horn parts written an octave lower than played.\no  If it appears absurdly low in the bass clef, the part is probably meant to be\ntransposed up.\no  The transposition is to play the part an octave higher than written.\n(cid:1)  For example: A C two lines below the bass clef would be played as a 2nd\nspace C in the bass clef.\n•  To practice this bass clef transposition skill, simply assign horn players to transpose tuba\nparts at first; then, give them real examples of 4th horn parts from any Classical or\nRomantic Era symphony to transpose.\n•  Like other transpositions, consistent practice will teach this skill in a matter of weeks.\nOther Techniques\n•  Lip Trills\no  This is a rapid alteration between two adjacent notes on the harmonic series.\no  This is called for on the harmonics no further than a whole-step apart.\no  Essentially, it is a fast series of lip slurs.\no  The key to the technique is an ease of air flow between the two alternating notes:\nthe constant air makes the trill, along with a slight motion of the back of the\ntongue.\n(cid:1)  Once a rapid speed is desired, a slight oscillation of the jaw will aid the\nclarity of the lip trill.\n(cid:1)  Remember, the lip trill is an alternation between two notes a whole step\napart. The lips should not noticeably move between the two notes.\n(cid:1)  The lip trill, like transposition, requires consistent and diligent practice.\nAdditionally, it requires technical facility and good flexibility to achieve.\no  The lip trill is called for by the normal trill directions, and it is distinguished from\nthe half-step trill by the key of the piece. If the trill is a half-step trill, it is a valve\ntrill. If it is a whole-step trill, it is a lip trill.\no  Consult professional recordings of any Mozart horn concerto to hear a good lip\ntrill.\n•  Echo/shadow horn\no  Primarily a French direction, this is the technique of nearly fully closing the hand\nin the bell and transposing up a half-step.\no  The desired sound is muffled and distant.\no  Typically denoted by sons d’echo\no  For example: Horn I in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice by Paul Dukas\n•  Hand tuning\no  This involves the fine tuning of pitch using the right hand.\n(cid:1)  Younger students do not have consistent pitch, so this technique is only\napplicable to students with stable pitch – whether in-tune or not.\no  To sharpen the pitch:\n(cid:1)  The hand can be pulled out of the bell.\n(cid:1)  The wrist can be bent away from the player.\n(cid:1)  The arm can be moved away from the player.\no  To flatten the pitch:\n(cid:1)  The hand can be pushed into the bell.\n(cid:1)  The wrist can be bent toward the player.\n(cid:1)  The arm can be moved toward the player.\no  This phenomenon occurs because moving the hand adjusts the “length” of the\nFrench horn.\n(cid:1)  Closing the hand produces a longer surface for sound to travel, thus\nlengthening the horn and lowering the pitch.\n(cid:1)  Opening the hand produces a shorter surface for sound to travel, thus\nshortening the horn and raising the pitch.\no  These adjustments are no larger than about a quarter tone either direction, so the\nhand is useful only for small adjustments of pitch.\nFRENCH HORN –\nEMPTYING THE FRENCH HORN\n•  Emptying the horn can be an ordeal, especially if the water is somewhere between slides;\nhowever, proper techniques and skill with emptying the horn using the appropriate slides\nwill purge 90% of the water.\no  It is actually 95-99% condensation and 1-5% spit that produces the gurgling\nsounds; therefore, “spit” covering the floor under the horn section is mostly water,\nnot disgusting saliva.\n•  Whenever emptying the horn, the basic technique (aside from using a dedicated spit\nvalve, which some instruments may not have) is taking a particular slide off of the horn\nand turning the horn such that the water falls out.\no  To make more water come out, always turn the horn so that the water moves\nvertically. This means that the slide to be emptied must point perpendicular to the\nground.\nIn the case of the main tuning slide (the one attached to the leadpipe) and the F tuning\nslide, simply take the slide off and dump the water.\n•  For all other slides, including the Bb tuning slide (if the horn has a Bb tuning slide), the\ncorresponding valve(s) must be depressed to properly empty the horn.\no  Consult the diagram on the next page for valves and corresponding slides.\no  Failure to properly depress the valves while emptying water does negatively\naffect the sealing on the rotors, and will slowly make the rotors move slower.\n•  Tricks for finding water:\no  Hold down each valve and blow air through the horn. Remember to blow through\nthe valves on the Bb side as well. Any audible gurgle means there is water in that\nparticular slide.\no  A gurgle without any valves depressed means that the water could be in:\nthe main tuning slide\nthe “fake” tuning slide/water slide\nthe F tuning slide\nthe area after all of the valves and before the bell\n(cid:2)  To empty this section, fully turn the horn clockwise – then point\nthe bell semi-vertically such that water can fall to the ground.\no  To catch any “pesky” water:\n1.  Turn the horn so that the valves are pointed vertically up and the keys are\non the lower side.\n2.  Wiggle all the keys for a few seconds, including the trigger.\n3.  After this, depress the trigger and the 3rd valve.\n4.  Tilt the horn 180° so that the keys are up and the slides are vertical, with\nthe holes pointed down.\n5.  Take out the Bb side 3rd valve.\n6.  Watch as water magically falls out of the horn.\nFrench Horn Diagram\n2nd Valve slide\n(Bb side underneath)\n1st Valve slide\nBb side underneath\n3rd Valve slide\n“Fake” Tuning Slide/Water Slide\nTrigger for Bb Side\n3rd Valve Key\n2nd Valve Key\n1st Valve Key"

    "text": "FRENCH HORN SLIDES\nMain Tuning Slide – The main tuning slide is the first slide on the horn.  It is located on the\nback side of the horn.  This slide affects the pitch of both sides of the horn (F and B-flat).\nF Tuning Slide – Double horns will have an additional slide on the back of the horn, the F\nTuning Slide that only affects the F side of the horn (without the trigger).  The main tuning slide\nshould be set first before setting this slide.  On a Kruspe wrap horn (more open wrap) the main\ntuning slide and F tuning slide will face in opposite directions.  On a Geyer wrap horn (tighter\nwrap = brighter sound) these slides will face the same direction. (see pictures below)\nExamples of Kruspe wrap horns: Conn 8D, Yamaha 668, Yamaha 668II, Conn 6D, Holton 179\nExample of a Geyer wrap horn: Yamaha 667\n“Fake” Tuning Slide – Many horns will have a fake tuning slide located on the front side of the\nhorn, near the mouthpiece.  This slide is used to empty water that collects in the horn – not for\ntuning purposes. This is the only slide on the horn that should be pushed in almost all the way.\nB-flat Tuning Slide – Some horns will also have a B-flat tuning slide which only affects the\npitch of the B-flat side of the horn (with the trigger).  This is a short slide that is located on the\nfront of the horn, in line with the valve slides.  It should be pulled about ¼ of an inch and then\nleft alone.  Adjustments to the B-flat side of the horn should be done with the main tuning slide.\nValve Slides – Each valve has its own tuning slide.  The F side valve slides are located in front,\nand the B-flat valve slides are the smaller ones located behind.  The valve slides should be set\napproximately equidistant with each other.  The F side slides should be pulled about ¼-3/8 of an\ninch.  The B-flat side slides should be pushed in slightly more than the F side slides because it is\na shorter horn.  The 1st and 2nd valve slides can be pulled out very slightly more to help\ncompensate for the sharp 1-2 valve combination, and the 3rd valve can be pushed in very slightly\nmore to help compensate for the flat 2-3 valve combination, especially on the Conn 8Ds. The Bb\nside 3rd valve needs to be barely out on the Conn 8D horns (as noted in the “Setting Slides”\nhandout) because of 3rd space C#, which is very flat.\nKRUSPE\nGEYER\nF Tuning Slide\nCONN 8D\nYAMAHA 668\nFake Tuning Slide\nMain Tuning Slide\nYAMAHA 668II\nCONN 6D\nHOLTON H179\nYAMAHA 667\nThe trigger valve casing is\nlocated on the far end of\nthe horn.

The student will\nneed to move to a double horn during the later middle school/early\nhigh school years.\n•  Pitched in both F and Bb\n(cid:1)  For most American double horns, the top set of slides is the F\nside while the bottom set of slides is the Bb side.\n(cid:1)  To use the Bb side, depress the thumb trigger.\n•  The player will read music for Horn in F.\n•  The descant horn will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch.\n•  Tuning notes for the double horn include tuning notes for both sides:\n(cid:1)  Tuning notes for the F side are written middle C and below the\nstaff B, Bb, A and Ab.\n(cid:1)  Tuning notes for the Bb side are written 1st space F, 2nd line E\n•  The double horn is the typical instrument of choice from middle\nschool to the professional level. The combination of the secure high\nrange of the Bb side and the smooth low range of the F side meets\nmost of the needs of the horn player well.\n•  Pitched in Bb and either high F or high Eb.\n(cid:1)  Like the double horn, the top set of slides is the Bb side while\nthe bottom set of slides is either the high F or high Eb side.\n(cid:1)  Like the double horn, depress the trigger to use the high F or\nhigh Eb side.\n•  Tuning notes for the descant horn include tuning notes for each of the\nsides:\n(cid:1)  Tuning for the high F side are written 3rd space C, 3rd line B and\nBb and 2nd line A and Ab.\n(cid:1)  Tuning notes for the high Eb side are written 3rd line Bb, 2nd\nspace A and Ab and 2nd line G and Gb.\n•  The descant horn is used to assist a professional horn player who is\nrequired to play in the high register.\n(cid:1)  The high F or high Eb side provides a more secure high register\nthan the Bb side.\n•  The descant horn is made for professional assistance, not to\ncompensate for technical deficiencies in younger players. As such,\nthis horn should not be used at the secondary level.\n•  Pitched in F, Bb and either high F or high Eb.\n(cid:1)  Just as the double horn, the top set of slides is the F side, the\nmiddle set is the Bb side, and the bottom set is either high F or\nhigh Eb.\n(cid:1)  Like the double horn, depress either the top trigger for the Bb\nside or the bottom trigger for the high F or high Eb side.\n•  The triple horn will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch.\n•  Tuning notes for the triple horn include tuning notes for each of the\nthree sides:\n(cid:1)  Tuning notes for the high F side are written 3rd space C, 3rd line\nB and Bb and 2nd line A and Ab.\n•  The triple horn is essentially a double horn with a descant side. Due to\nspecific compensations in horn construction, each of the sides will not\nsound as resonant as on double horns with the particular sides.\n•  The triple horn provides a more secure high register on the high F or\nhigh Eb side while maintaining the flexibility of range in the other two\nsides.\n•  The triple horn, like the descant horn, is made to assist professional\nplayers, not to compensate for technical deficiencies in younger\nplayers. As such, this horn should not be used at the secondary level.\n•  The Vienna horn comes with a crook mechanism. As such, the player\ncan play in all twelve chromatic keys, using particular crooks\naccording to particular composer directions or particular keys.\n(cid:1)  The most common crook is the F crook, so the horn is most\noften pitched in F.\n•  The player will read music written for horn in any key. The player\nmust read the music for the particular horn key printed.\n(cid:1)  The most common crook is the F crook, so the player will\nusually read music for Horn in F.\n•  As this horn can play in any key via the crook mechanism, its\nsounding pitch will vary according to the crook used.\n(cid:1)  The rule for finding the transposition is, “C’s a C, sounds the\nkey.” This means that a printed C in any octave will produce\nthe key of the crook without any valves depressed.\n(cid:1)  For example, a Vienna horn with an A crook would sound a 2nd\nspace A if the printed note was 3rd space C. As such, the\ntransposition for the A crook would be down a minor 3rd from\nconcert pitch.\n(cid:1)  The most common crook is the F crook, so the Vienna horn will\nsound a perfect 5th lower than concert pitch.\n•  Tuning notes for the Vienna horn will vary according to the crook\nused.\n(cid:1)  The most common crook is the F crook. Tuning notes for the\nVienna horn with an F crook are written middle C and below\nthe staff B, Bb, A and Ab.\n•  While the Vienna horn still uses teardrop keys (like on all other\nhorns), the horn uses the pump valve system. This system is\nessentially a double-piston valve system, where the pistons are\nactivated with long rods attached to the teardrop keys.\n(cid:1)  This system allows for the characteristic smooth legatos and\nslurs heard on the Vienna horn.\n•  The Vienna horn is only used in Vienna, Austria, most famously in\nthe Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.\n•  The Vienna horn will not be used at the secondary level.\n•  Pitched in Bb\n•  The marching horn will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch.\n•  Tuning notes for the marching horn are written 1st space F, 2nd line E\n(cid:1)  The marching horn was not necessarily designed to play in\ntune. Tuning will be a constant issue with this instrument.\n•  The marching horn is one of the two marching band versions of\nFrench horns. This instrument is used in marching band because the\nbell faces toward the front rather than behind (as a normal French\nhorn would).\n•  The fact that the marching horn is pitched in Bb makes it easier and\nmore accurate to play.\n•  Pitched in high F or high Eb\n•  The player will read music for Horn in F or for Horn in Eb.\n•  The mellophone will sound a perfect 5th below concert pitch if pitched\nin high F or a major 6th below concert pitch if pitched in high Eb.\n•  Most marching bands will use mellophones pitch in high F.\n•  Tuning notes the mellophone depend on its pitch.\n(cid:1)  Tuning notes for a high F and high Eb mellophone are written\n3rd space C, 3rd line B and Bb and 2nd line A and Ab.\n(cid:1)  For the high F mellophone, these notes are concert F, E, Eb, D\nand Db.\n(cid:1)  For the high Eb mellophone, these notes are concert Eb, D, Db,\nC and B.\n(cid:1)  Like the marching horn, the mellophone was not necessarily\ndesigned to play in tune.

This means that the slide to be emptied must point perpendicular to the\nground.\n•\nIn the case of the main tuning slide (the one attached to the leadpipe) and the F tuning\nslide, simply take the slide off and dump the water.\n•  For all other slides, including the Bb tuning slide (if the horn has a Bb tuning slide), the\ncorresponding valve(s) must be depressed to properly empty the horn.\no  Consult the diagram on the next page for valves and corresponding slides.\no  Failure to properly depress the valves while emptying water does negatively\naffect the sealing on the rotors, and will slowly make the rotors move slower.\n•  Tricks for finding water:\no  Hold down each valve and blow air through the horn. Remember to blow through\nthe valves on the Bb side as well. Any audible gurgle means there is water in that\nparticular slide.\no  A gurgle without any valves depressed means that the water could be in:\n(cid:1)\nthe main tuning slide\nthe “fake” tuning slide/water slide\nthe F tuning slide\nthe area after all of the valves and before the bell\n(cid:2)  To empty this section, fully turn the horn clockwise – then point\nthe bell semi-vertically such that water can fall to the ground.\no  To catch any “pesky” water:\n1.  Turn the horn so that the valves are pointed vertically up and the keys are\non the lower side.\n2.  Wiggle all the keys for a few seconds, including the trigger.\n3.  After this, depress the trigger and the 3rd valve.\n4.  Tilt the horn 180° so that the keys are up and the slides are vertical, with\nthe holes pointed down.\n5.  Take out the Bb side 3rd valve.\n6.

    "text": "FRENCH HORN ARTICULATION\n•  The tongue moves in the same manner when articulating a brass instrument as it\ndoes when you speak.  The tongue moves up and down—not back and forth—\nboth when speaking and when articulation on an instrument.\n•  The purpose of the tongue is to release the air, which causes the lips to vibrate and\ncreates the sound. The tongue’s release of the air simply defines the\nbeginning/start of the vibration/sound.\n•  Articulation is used to define the vibrations necessary to create musical rhythm,\nstyle and movement-- to contrast the use of slurring (which also creates similar\nmusical entities).\n•  The students should think that the tongue “articulates” the sound created by the\nairstream.  If the student is taught to create the sound correctly, articulation will\nbe an easy transition.\na.  Sound occurs when the air moves past the naturally vibrating\nlips.\nb.  Articulate the sound that is already present.\nc.  Teach students to articulate at the moment the sound begins.\n•  Without the instrument or mouthpiece, use the following procedure:\n1.   Say the word “DOG”.\n2.  Sing the syllable “DAH”.\n3.  Once these are mastered, have the student use the mouthpiece and\ninstrument and reproduce the “DAH” syllable in their brain to create\nan articulated sound.\n4.  The tongue should feel the same when saying, singing and playing the\nmouthpiece and instrument.\n5.  The tongue should touch the enamel of the upper teeth directly below\nthe gum line—in the same spot with the same strength every time.\n6.  Use the syllable “DAH” because it creates smoother and more easily\ncontrolled air as opposed to the “TAH” syllable.\n7.  After each “articulation”, the tongue must immediately fall down into\nits natural position.\n8.  The tongue will be naturally soft at all times, but can touch the teeth\nwith different strengths.\n9.  The tongue will be in its “down position” 98% of the time when\narticulating correctly.\n10. The French horn requires a warmer and “darker” airstream than the\ntrumpet.\n•  Have the student start their sound with the air.\n•  Using the information about the basics of articulation, have the student articulate\nas fast as they can with no limitations of numbers, worries about evenness of\narticulation, etc.  Simply get them used to articulating!\n•  Have the student then use the “ta-day” syllable to practice using the tongue in an\norganized manner.\n•  Have the student then articulate “on command.”  The student will start their\nsound, and articulate when you snap your fingers to practice gaining more control\nof the tongue.\n•  Once the student understands pulse and the foot pat, have the student articulate\nexactly when the toe of the foot touches the floor.\n•  Have the student articulate with the down and up position of the foot. Proceed to\nwritten rhythms as they begin to read music.\n•  Always practice this entire routine.  The student must always go through the\nentire process, so he will not lose the ability to move his tongue at various\nspeeds and in unstructured manners.\n•  Advanced technique for low register (around 2nd space C in bass clef): move the\ntongue lower, toward the bottom of the top teeth. If the articulation is generally\nunclear in the lower/pedal register, this technique does wonders to “clean up” the\narticulation.\n•  Advanced technique for muted playing: articulate way firmer. The articulation\nneeds to be far more defined to compensate for the straight mute placed in the bell\n– and not quite as firm an articulation for stopped horn playing."

    "text": "FRENCH HORN TUNING AND\nSETTING FRENCH HORN SLIDES\n1.  You must know what kind of horn the student is playing because the number of\ntuning slides varies.\n2.  Do not tune just one note.  The placement for each note can vary.  Tuning just one\nnote will not give you an accurate slide setting.\n3.  Slide settings do matter, but not as much as playing fundamentals.  If a student is\nvibrating the wrong note on the mouthpiece, the sound can be incorrect in a\nnumber of different ways.\nInaccurate or inconsistent hand placement\nInaccurate or inconsistent slide placement\nCommon Mistakes Regarding French Horn Tuning\n•\n•  Pulling the wrong slide\n•  Pulling a slide for the wrong reason\n•  Wrong ratio of tuning slides to one another\nWill the correct slide please stand up…?\n•  There are three kinds of tuning slides on horn:\n(cid:1)  F side\n(cid:1)  Bb side\n(cid:1)  Combination or main slide\n•  The top stack of valve slides is the F side; the bottom stack is the Bb side.  Single-\nsided horns only have one stack.\n•  The water slide on the front and closest to the player is an imposter; this slide should\nbe pushed almost all the way in all the time.\n•  All tuning slides should be pulled about the same amount and be in equal ratio with\neach other.\nHOLTON FARKAS H179\n•  The main slide is on the top but in the back (while on the lap).\n•  The Bb tuning slide is sideways in the front.\n•  The F tuning slide is the bottom slide on the back.\n•  The front vertical slide is a fake tuning slide.  This slide is used for emptying water\nand does not affect tuning.\n•  All valve slides should be pulled about ¼ of an inch.\nCONN 8D\n•  The fake/wannabe water slide is on the front (from the student’s point of view).\n•  The main slide is on the top in the back.\n•  The F slide is on the bottom in the back.\n•  The 3rd valve slide on Bb side should be pulled out a tiny amount – enough so it does\nnot become stuck, but not enough to affect tuning. 3rd space C#’s are noticeably flat\non this horn, and the other T23 and T3 valve combinations will be fine despite this\nadjustment.\nYAMAHA 667\n•  The Bb and F slides are side by side on the back.\nOther Brands\n•  Take out the slide in question. Play a note without the trigger.  If you hear a note\nrather than a mystery sound, the F side does not use that tuning slide.  Play a note\nwith the trigger. If you hear a note rather than a mystery sound, the Bb side does not\nuse that tuning slide.\nSetting French Horn Slides\nIt is important to set French horn slides early.  Setting horn slides helps to establish\npitch center.  Do not “tune” the slides – just set the slides. At first, beginners will not\nhave a correct pitch center, so tuning the slides is useless. Additionally, there is an\nextensive tuning process for tuning each slide.\n•  At first, all slides should be pulled out ¼ inch (even the fake/wannabe water slide).\nFrench horns are made to be in tune with the slides out, and this will keep the slides\nfrom becoming stuck.\n•  As students become more advanced, slides can be individually tuned.\n•  The 1st, 2nd and 3rd valve tuning slides should be pulled out equidistantly on the F side\nof the horn.\nThe C Major Scale: Tuning the Horn from Middle C to 5th line F\nTuning the F Side (no trigger)\n•  Have the student play the first five notes from first ledger line below the staff C to\nsecond line G.  Eye ball the entire part of the scale.  This generally tunes the F side of\nthe horn.  Set the tuner to first line E and second line G.  All concert F’s should be in\ntune on the F side.\n•  To tune the 1st, 2nd and 3rd valve slides on the F side, descend chromatically from\nmiddle C. Below the staff B and Bb should be in tune (via the 1st and 2nd valves on\nthe F side, respectively), and below the staff Ab can somewhat tune the 3rd valve after\ntuning the 2nd valve with below the staff B.\nTuning the Bb side (trigger)\n•  Have the student play second line G to third space C.  This generally tunes the Bb\n(trigger) side of the horn.  You are really looking at the 3rd space C. (If C and G are in\ntune but A and B are out of tune, adjust the second valve slide.)\n•  To tune the 1st, 2nd and 3rd valve slides on the Bb side, descend chromatically from 1st\nspace F (which should be in tune). 1st line E and Eb should in tune (via the 1st and 2nd\nvalves on the Bb side, respectively). Use below the staff Db to tune the 3rd valve after\ntuning the 2nd valve, although the note should stand slightly out of tune.\nHave the student play 3rd space C to 5th line F.  Eye ball the entire part of the scale.  You\nare really looking at the C and the F.  (If the D and E are out of tune, adjust the bottom\nfirst or second valve slide.) Like the octave below, this is supposed to be the “in-tune”\nharmonic; however, students may have trouble playing with proper vowel shapes in this\nregister."

Identify these marks,\nand their relationship to the top and bottom of the case.  Most cases have the handles\nplaced on the bottom section of each case.  Check to make sure.\n•  Place all French horn cases on the floor in front of the student.\n•  Be sure the student understands where and which direction each part of the\ninstrument belongs in the case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from\nthe case.  Make sure the student waits for each instruction before performing the\ntask.  Be sure the parts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse order\nthey were removed.\n•  The French horn should be removed first, followed by the mouthpiece.  When putting\nthe instrument back, the order is reversed – mouthpiece first, followed by the French\nhorn.\n•  All instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure\nexplicitly every time.\n•  Never leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up, but this\nis not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.  Check each\nopening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to your students.\n•  Cases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom setup\nfor each student’s case.  If using an ensemble room for the class, the cases may be\nopened in the hall.  The empty case will remain closed and latched in the hall during\nclass.\n•  When instruments are in their cases, do not allow students to sit on their cases AT\nANY TIME because the lead pipe and/or bell will get bent.\nSpecific Information about Removing the French Horn from Its Case\n•  Open the case fully before removing the French horn. Some cases may not open such\nthat both sides are on the floor. For these cases, one side will stay up and possibly fall\non the horn while removing it from the case.\n•  When possible, remove the French horn by gripping the main pipe running between\nall the valves and slides. This is the sturdiest part of the instrument. Do not grip the\nhorn by the bell, as the bell contains some of the thinner layers of metal on the\ninstrument."

Take a mouthpiece brush and run it through the mouthpiece under warm\nwater in the sink.\n(cid:1)  The brush will not go all the way through, so insert the brush\nthrough both ends to fully clean each end.\n(cid:1)  Soap is not necessary, but it does not hurt the mouthpiece to use it.\nThe same goes for mouthwash. If these are used, simply rinse the\nmouthpiece thoroughly afterwards and let it air dry so that the\nalcohol evaporates.\n•  This process should be done every week to two weeks.\nSlide Maintenance\n•  The insides of the slides and various tubes build up grime, various dirt particles,\nand germs, so the slides must be snaked at least once a month.\n•  To snake a horn:\n1.  Take out the appropriate slide, pressing down the appropriate valve while\ntaking it out, and place the slide on a towel or soft surface.\n2.  Run water through the unattached slide, preferably in the opposite\ndirection of air flow.\n(cid:1)\nIn the case of the main tuning slide and the lead pipe, also run\nwater through the lead pipe – starting on the end with the tuning\nslide, not the end with the mouthpiece receiver.\n3.

Repeat the above step on the immovable part of the slide attached to the\nrotor. Be careful to not jam the snake against the rotor.\n5.  Repeat the above two steps with all slides, including the main tuning slide,\nthe F tuning slide and the Bb tuning slide.\n6.  Apply slide grease as necessary according to the below steps.\n•  There are numerous slides on the French horn. Each of these must be well-\nlubricated with slide grease. Refer to the “Maintenance Kit” handout for pictures\nof slide greases.\n•  To apply the grease:\n1.  Take out the slide to be greased, pressing down the appropriate valve.\n2.  With a paper towel, wipe off the slide to clean the grease and any grime on\nthe slide.\n3.  If the grease is a liquid, squeeze the bottle and apply a line of grease down\ntwo sides of the slide. If the grease is more of a cream, use the index finger\nto apply the grease along most of the length of the slide.\n(cid:1)  Do not apply too much grease, as the slides can become too\nlubricated and fall out.\n4.  Re-insert the slide and slide it fully in and out a few times. Insert only one\nside of the slide in and rotate the slide while moving it in and out. Press\ndown the appropriate valve the entire time during this process.\n5.  Push the slide all the way in and use a paper towel to wipe off any extra\ngrease located where the immovable and movable parts of the slide meet.\n6.  Repeat this process for all slides as needed – even fake tuning slides.\n•  This process should be done every month or so.\nValve Maintenance\n•  With a Holton French horn, you will have to constantly apply oil to the valves.\n•  Oil all the moving parts.  Oil is like most wonderful things…you cannot have too\nmuch!\n•  Put oil on the springs, under the valve cap, and inside the slides to keep the oil\nfrom mixing with slide grease and slowing down the valve.  Then move the slide\nin and out while pressing on the corresponding valve. Make sure that your\nstudents routinely depress the keys when emptying their slides.\n•  There are two types of rotary oil – rotor oil and rotor spindle/bearing oil. Rotor oil\nlooks like normal valve oil, whereas spindle oil has a “needle-looking” thing.\nRotor oil goes in the slides to lubricate the outside of the rotor casing.\nSpindle/bearing oil goes under the valve caps, such that the raised portion is\ncovered in a small dome of oil. It also goes on the underside, inside of a crevice\nbetween the middle vertical screw and the bumpers. The spindle/bearing oil\nlubricates the interior mechanism of the rotor. It is wise to not mix these up, as the\ntwo oils have different thicknesses (and rotors do not like it when they have the\nwrong oil).\n•  On some horns, there are strings connecting the components of the rotary valves.\nThese strings will break on occasion, and they can be an ordeal to tie – especially\nif the student or director is inexperienced.

    "text": "FRENCH HORN FLEXIBILITY AND RANGE\nEXTENSTION\n•  Brass playing is based upon flexibility.\n•  There are two types of flexibility: flexibility within the instrument and flexibility\nwithin the note.\n•  Students eventually need to be flexible through each of the harmonic series in\norder to move up and down within the range of the instrument.\n•  Once the student can reproduce at will a given pitch, the teacher must decide\nwhether flexibility up or down is needed first.\n•  Flexibility is controlled by air direction and the isometrics created by the corners\nand canine/eye teeth.  The head must always stay in its natural, balanced position\nat all times.  The angle of the instrument must not change at any time…exception\nbeing possibly in the extreme low register (below 2nd space C) and the high\nregister (above G on top of the treble clef staff). Many professional horn players\naround the world recommend angle changes in these registers if there are sound\nproduction problems. This is a technique to use with very advanced high school\nplayers, but not with middle school/junior high students.\n•  Students must learn to angle the air in the cup of the mouthpiece without changing\nthe position of the lips and/or the relationship of the upper and lower teeth.\nFlexibility is also enhanced by vowel sounds used in various registers.  These\nsounds can be “ah” for the middle register….”ee” for the upper register….and\n“oh” for the lower register.  Have students practice saying these vowel sounds\nwith vocalization on appropriate lower, middle and higher sounds.\n(cid:1)  “Ee” starts around 3rd space C.\n(cid:1)  “Ah” is used from middle C to 3rd space C.\n(cid:1)  “Oh” starts in the range from around middle C to below the staff A.\n(cid:1)  “Ooh” can be used in the low register (2nd space C in the bass clef).\nThe “ooh” vowel shape corrects sharp pitch tendencies, tight tone\nquality, and inability to produce notes in this register.\n(cid:1)  “Howaii” – that is, “Hoh” + “wah” + “ee” – takes students through\neach vowel sound. It is also very similar to “Hawaii”, making it easy\nto remember.\n•  Bring to the students’ attention that the shape of the tongue changes dramatically\nfrom vowel sound to vowel sound.  All students should be aware that vowel\nsounds are the middles of words that they speak every day.  Practice saying words\nthat use the required vowel sounds. (i.e.  bow, ball, beep) As students move\nbetween vowel sounds, remind them to keep their throats relaxed. As they ascend,\nthere may be a tendency to close the throat while saying “ee.” This is\ncounterproductive to playing high; therefore, students should be blowing with a\nrelaxed body.  The oral cavity and the lips are the only things that should change.\n•  Range is developed through flexibility.  It is more important to create a resonant\nsound while practicing flexibility than to create wider intervals.  The student can\nenhance their range by making more resonant sounds in the middle register before\ntrying to extend higher or lower.\n•  Make sure students understand the texture of the lips has nothing to do with\nrange.  For example, students should never be told to “tighten” their lips in order\nto play in the higher register. The shape of the lips remains the same throughout\nall registers; therefore, students should not smile in the high register.\n•  All basic fundamentals for teaching brass instruments hold true for the French\nhorn.  Remember the harmonics on the French horn are much closer than on the\ntrumpet.  Flexibility is actually easier to achieve on the French horn, but accuracy\nis more difficult.  Do not be too demanding in the very beginning in regards to\naccuracy.\n(cid:1)  Start asking beginning students what note they think they are playing.\nThis will be more easily accomplished after having them sing some\nbasic/simple passages. There must be an awareness of where the\nstudents are playing on the harmonic series of the horn.\n(cid:1)  A big problem with younger students is being unable to tell that they\nare on the incorrect harmonic while playing. Again, this is to build\nawareness and not necessarily to demand accuracy.\n•  As students descend, there is a common tendency to run out of air because they\nare not used to blowing all the way through the instrument. This will start\nhappening around 4th line F in the bass clef. Students must blow large amounts of\nslow, hot air. Sometimes they try blowing a lot of air…but it comes out too fast\nbecause they are blowing too hard."

    "text": "FRENCH HORN INSTRUMENT/BODY\nRATIO AND HAND POSITION\nInstrument/Body Ratio\n•  Assuming that the student is either standing or sitting with correct posture, instruct\nthem to pick up the body of the French horn with both hands and simply lift it by\nusing their arms.  Move the instrument up and down, side to side, higher than usual\nand lower than usual.  As students are doing this, have them notice how it affects the\nbalance of the body.  Eventually, the body should feel as balanced with or without the\ninstrument in hand.\n•  Make sure students bring instruments to them… and not them to the instruments.\nWhen done incorrectly, their body collapses and their air is obstructed.\n•  Shoulders should be straight across when facing the director and it should feel the\nsame way when doing breathing exercises  (do not twist or shift the upper body out of\nthe breathing position)\n•  The French horn should not be slanted in a manner in which moves the students’ head\nfrom its natural position.\n•  Angles of mouthpieces should be slightly lower than level.\n•  Although single F horns are lighter and easier for students to control in the\nbeginning stages of playing, it is suggested that beginning French horn students\nare started on double horns. Of course, this decision may be dictated by what\ninstruments are available in your inventory.\nHand Position\n1.  The most natural shape of everyone’s hands forms a flat “C”.\n2.  All hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall behind the\nwrist.\n3.  There should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the French horn.\n4.  The inside of the arm must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding\nthe French horn correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\n5.  Elbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be\nhampered.\n6.  Place both the left and the right hand in their correct “beginner” position.  The left\nhand is placed on the valves and will lie in the “flat-C” position.  No tension should\nbe felt in this hand, as the fingers move “with” the valves.\n7.  The right hand will be cupped on the outer ridge of the bottom of the bell.  Both\nhands hold and balance the French horn in the beginning.  The horn does not rest on\nthe leg.  The right hand is not placed inside the bell until the teacher determines that\nthe student can balance the horn in this manner.  An added bonus to holding the\nFrench horn by the bottom of the bell will result in the student being able to hear—\nand expect to hear—a more resonant sound when the hand is finally in its\ncorrect/more advanced position inside the bell.\n8.  Though not a part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling\nthe instrument toward the student’s face.  Instruct students to keep their elbows soft\nwhile playing the French horn.\n9.  The palms of both hands should feel soft.\n10. The teacher must watch young students closely to monitor that their shoulders stay\nbalanced and feel naturally soft at all times."

    "text": "FRENCH HORN GENERAL\nTUNING TENDENCIES\nThe Harmonic Series\n•  The harmonic series is the set of notes that can be played on one finger\ncombination.\n•  Here is the harmonic series for open (no valves pressed):\n+2\n+4\n+2  +41\n-14\n-32\n-14  -49\n-12\n•  On the French horn, there is one harmonic series for each valve combination on\nboth the F and Bb sides to make a total of 12 different harmonic series.\n•  Each harmonic series has similar pitch tendencies as the ones listed on this\ndiagram. Transpose the series up or down depending on the valve combination:\no  T0: Up a perfect fourth (starts on F below the bass clef)\no  T2: Up a major third (starts on E below the bass clef)\no  T1: Up a minor third (starts on Eb below the bass clef)\no  T12: Up a major second (starts on D below the bass clef)\no  T23: Up a minor second (starts on Db below the bass clef)\no  2: Down a minor second (starts on B below the bass clef)\no  1: Down a major second (starts on Bb below the bass clef)\no  12: Down a minor third (starts on A below the bass clef)\no  23: Down a major third (starts on Ab below the bass clef)\no  13: Down a perfect fourth (starts on G below the bass clef)\no  123: Down a tritone (starts on Gb below the bass clef)\n•  To remedy pitch problems as listed on the diagram:\no  Adjust the vowel shape\no  Adjust the right hand\no  Use a different fingering\n•\nIn addition to the above general harmonic tendencies of the horn, the following\nnotes have additional tuning issues associated with them. A number refers to a\nparticular valve. A “0” refers to open or no valves depressed.\nSharp Notes\n• Moderately sharp\n• Very sharp\n• More open “ah” vowel\n• Use open “ooh” vowel\n• Can use 3 to flatten pitch\n• Slightly sharp\n• More open “oh” vowel\n• Can use T3 to flatten pitch\n• Use open “ah” vowel\n• Very sharp on Conn 8D\n• Use open “ee” vowel\nIgnore this for Conn 8D\n• Can use T2, but may be too flat\nFlat Notes\n• Moderately flat\n• Use taller “ah” vowel\n• Very flat on Conn 8D\n• Push in T3 valve slide almost all\nthe way in because of this note\n• Moderately to very flat if\nT2 is used\n• Use taller “ee” vowel\nT0 is used\nGeneral Tendencies\n•  As shown above, the valve combinations 12, 23, 13, 123, T12, and T23 all\ngenerally produce sharp notes on the horn.\n•  For some notes with these fingerings, alternate fingerings can be used to alleviate\npitch problems. With others of these fingerings, a combination of vowel\nplacement and right hand tuning must be used to compensate for these fingerings."

    "text": "FRENCH HORN – ADVANCED TECHNIQUES\nFOR FRENCH HORN\n•  There are numerous techniques beyond range, flexibility, articulation, and other\nfundamentals that are vital to playing literature for more mature horn players, such as a\nfair amount of works for high school band.\nRight Hand Technique\n•  After the beginner year, the right hand player must be placed into the bell for proper tone\nquality and tuning.\n•  To create the create the correct right hand shape:\n1.  Take the right hand and hold it out like shaking a person’s hand.\n2.  Bring all the fingers together so they are touching each other then let the thumb\nrest on top of the index finger.\n3.  Keeping a relaxed hand, put this right hand into the bell so that the knuckles are\ntouching the far side of the bell and line up to where the bell begins to flare.\na.  Depending on the teacher’s preference, the index finger can be anywhere\nfrom a “12 o’ clock” to a “10 o’ clock” position in the bell.\n4.  The hand should be straight, while the wrist, elbow and shoulder should be\nrelaxed and free of tension.\na.  The wrist can be bent or straight depending on the needs of the student.\n•  The hand must not be cupped while in the bell, as this will produce a muffled sound.\n•\nIndividual students will need to adjust how far in the hand must be and how much to\nturn their hand according to body size, tuning, and tone quality.\no  A noticeably sharp, bright sound means that the hand is too far out.\no  A noticeably flat, muffled sound means that the hand is too far in.\no  A muffled sound may also mean that the hand is too cupped.\nTransposition\n•  Transposition is the process involved while playing a horn part written for a horn not in\nthe key of F (ex. Horn in C, Dvorak Symphony No. 9, mvt.1, Horns 3 and 4).\no  The general rule is: C’s a C, sounds the key. This means that a written C on any\npart will sound the key of the instrument playing that part.\n(cid:1)  Ex. A written C for clarinet in A sounds an A on the piano and other non-\ntransposing instruments.\no  Remember, the transposition is from the printed “Horn in _” key to Horn in F.\no  A little trick to find the transposition interval is to find the closest interval\nbetween Horn in F and the printed horn key. This is the interval and direction for\nthe transposition.\n(cid:1)  Ex. The music has printed “Horn in A.” The interval between Horn in F\nand Horn in A is an ascending major third, so one would play a major\nthird up from the printed notes.\no  The most common keys or transpositions are Horn in E and Horn in Eb.\n(cid:1)  To transpose Horn in E, play a half-step lower than printed.\n(cid:2)  Ex. A written 3rd line B-natural would be played as a Bb/A#.\n(cid:1)  To transpose Horn in Eb, play a whole-step lower than written.\n(cid:2)  Ex. A written 5th line F would be played as a(n) Eb/D#.\n(cid:1)  As exercises, have students transpose short segments of a familiar slow\npiece at first. The familiarity will allow them to use their ear to help\ndetermine if their transposition is correct.\n(cid:1)  Then, lengthen the selection of pieces and include faster pieces. After this,\ninclude pieces in various meters and with accidentals.\n(cid:1)  A common mistake when transposing is forgetting accidentals and key\nsignatures. These must be accounted for when transposing a part.\n(cid:1)  Do not allow students to write in transposed note names. This skill is\nsight-transposing, and this crutch may hinder students’ progress in\nlearning to properly transpose.\n(cid:1)  This is a skill that requires dedication, persistence, and drill. A little daily\npractice…even 2 minutes…will improve the skill.\nMuted Horn\n•  Muted horn is called for by a variety of directions, but always involved putting a straight\nmute into the bell of the horn.\no  There is no hand alternative to this technique, so a string or other mechanism for\nholding the mute by hanging at the wrist is vital for quick mute changes.\n•  Musical directions for muted horn:\no  “Mute” vs. “Open”\n(cid:1)  English pieces/contemporary pieces\n(cid:1)  “Mute” denotes a section to be played with the mute in.\n(cid:1)  “Open” denotes a section to be played with the mute out.\no  Mit Dampfer vs. ohne Dampfer\n(cid:1)  German composers\n(cid:1)  Mit Dampfer means “with dampener” or with the mute in.\n(cid:1)  Ohne Dampfer means “without dampener” or with the mute out.\no  Con sordino vs. senza sordino\n(cid:1)  Con sordino denotes to play with the mute in.\n(cid:1)  Senza sordino denotes to play with the mute out.\n(cid:1)  As very common directions, these can be abbreviated to con sord. and\nsenza sord.\no  For all of these directions, they each denote a section of music to played\naccordingly, like tempo or style directions.\n•  To play effectively, the player must put more air into their sound and horn, regardless of\nthe dynamic. At all dynamics above piano, there must be a slight buzz to the sound.\nStopped Horn\n•  Stopped horn, called for via various directions in the part, is accomplished in one of two\nways:\n1.  Muting the horn with a stop mute\n(cid:1)  This is simple: stick the stop mute in the bell of the horn like a straight\nmute, ensuring that the hole is completely sealed. The seal is open if there\nis an airy sound or leak.\n(cid:1)  This is easier to produce the desired sound, especially in the lower\n(cid:1)\nregister.\nIt takes some time to move the mute in and out of the horn, so a string\nshould be tied to the mute.\nIf the mute change is too fast in the music, the player must hand mute the\nhorn.\n2.  Muting the horn by fully closing the bell bore with the hand\n(cid:1)  To hand-mute the horn, simply collapse the wrist of the right hand to seal\nthe opposite wall as the fingers. Rotate or adjust the fingers or wrist to\ncompletely seal the horn.\n(cid:1)  Again, an airy, muffled or diffuse (lacking in support) sound reveals an\nincomplete seal in the hand.\n(cid:1)  This is the technique favored by professionals, and it does not require an\nadditional mute.\n(cid:1)  This is the best stopped horn technique for quick mute changes.\nIn both cases, the player must blow a noticeably larger amount of air – like playing a\nnormal forte or fortissimo – such that the player produces a buzzy or brassy sound.\no  This is more difficult as one descends the range of the horn – it is difficult just\nbelow the staff, and quite difficult near low C (2nd space C in bass clef).\nIn both cases, the section to be stopped must be transposed like Horn in E – played a half-\nstep lower than written, on the F side.\no  For a few notes, this transposition will not produce the correct note or play close\nto “in-tune.” On these notes (which are different on each horn), experiment to find\na fingering which will play the note “in-tune.”\no  Remember, play a half-step lower on the F side, even above 2nd line G.\n•  Music directions for stopped horn:\no  (+) = stopped, (o) = open\n(cid:1)  This is a common direction in newer music and simple to remember.\nIn this system, there are usually +’s over each note to be stopped, and a\nsingle “o” to end the stopped horn direction.\no  Gestopft vs. Offen\n(cid:1)  Gestopft denotes stopped\n(cid:1)  Offen denotes open\n(cid:1)  For these directions, the word will be printed above the beginning of the\nsection to be stopped or opened.\n(cid:1)  Until the next gestopft or offen direction, the music is played according to\nthe last direction given.\n(cid:1)  This is the common system used by German composers, such as Wagner\nand Mahler.\no  Bouché cuivré vs. Ouvert\n(cid:1)  Bouché cuivré denotes stopped horn.\nIt may sometimes be denoted as just cuivré (closed) or, mistakenly,\nas bouché (brassy). If the music only notes bouché, check previous\nrecordings to see if the direction is for stopped horn or just a loud,\nbrassy sound.\n(cid:1)  Ouvert or a similar-looking word denotes open.\n(cid:1)  This system works the same as the German system for stopped horn\ndirections.\nReading Bass Clef\n•  All French horn players should be proficient in reading both treble and bass clef,\nparticularly 2nd and 4th horn players.\n•  Older pieces (generally those written before 1880-1900) that are not edited to modern\nnotation will have bass clef horn parts written an octave lower than played.\no  If it appears absurdly low in the bass clef, the part is probably meant to be\ntransposed up.\no  The transposition is to play the part an octave higher than written.\n(cid:1)  For example: A C two lines below the bass clef would be played as a 2nd\nspace C in the bass clef.\n•  To practice this bass clef transposition skill, simply assign horn players to transpose tuba\nparts at first; then, give them real examples of 4th horn parts from any Classical or\nRomantic Era symphony to transpose.\n•  Like other transpositions, consistent practice will teach this skill in a matter of weeks.\nOther Techniques\n•  Lip Trills\no  This is a rapid alteration between two adjacent notes on the harmonic series.\no  This is called for on the harmonics no further than a whole-step apart.\no  Essentially, it is a fast series of lip slurs.\no  The key to the technique is an ease of air flow between the two alternating notes:\nthe constant air makes the trill, along with a slight motion of the back of the\ntongue.\n(cid:1)  Once a rapid speed is desired, a slight oscillation of the jaw will aid the\nclarity of the lip trill.\n(cid:1)  Remember, the lip trill is an alternation between two notes a whole step\napart. The lips should not noticeably move between the two notes.\n(cid:1)  The lip trill, like transposition, requires consistent and diligent practice.\nAdditionally, it requires technical facility and good flexibility to achieve.\no  The lip trill is called for by the normal trill directions, and it is distinguished from\nthe half-step trill by the key of the piece. If the trill is a half-step trill, it is a valve\ntrill. If it is a whole-step trill, it is a lip trill.\no  Consult professional recordings of any Mozart horn concerto to hear a good lip\ntrill.\n•  Echo/shadow horn\no  Primarily a French direction, this is the technique of nearly fully closing the hand\nin the bell and transposing up a half-step.\no  The desired sound is muffled and distant.\no  Typically denoted by sons d’echo\no  For example: Horn I in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice by Paul Dukas\n•  Hand tuning\no  This involves the fine tuning of pitch using the right hand.\n(cid:1)  Younger students do not have consistent pitch, so this technique is only\napplicable to students with stable pitch – whether in-tune or not.\no  To sharpen the pitch:\n(cid:1)  The hand can be pulled out of the bell.\n(cid:1)  The wrist can be bent away from the player.\n(cid:1)  The arm can be moved away from the player.\no  To flatten the pitch:\n(cid:1)  The hand can be pushed into the bell.\n(cid:1)  The wrist can be bent toward the player.\n(cid:1)  The arm can be moved toward the player.\no  This phenomenon occurs because moving the hand adjusts the “length” of the\nFrench horn.\n(cid:1)  Closing the hand produces a longer surface for sound to travel, thus\nlengthening the horn and lowering the pitch.\n(cid:1)  Opening the hand produces a shorter surface for sound to travel, thus\nshortening the horn and raising the pitch.\no  These adjustments are no larger than about a quarter tone either direction, so the\nhand is useful only for small adjustments of pitch."

    "text": "FRENCH HORN FACE/EMBOUCHURE\n•  Each student should use their own “safe/unbreakable” mirror—both in the\nclassroom and at home.\n•  Using the mirror, have each student notice how natural their face looks.  They will\nhave to later remember and memorize how it looks and feels.\n•  The head must be balanced on the shoulders in a comfortable position—not too\nfar forward and not too far backward.\n•  The eyes should be soft and natural, and the “sight line” should be exactly level.\nThe distance between eyebrows should not change as air goes in and out of the\nbody.\n•  Look for natural creases in the face, and allow any that are naturally present to\nexist while playing.  No other creases are allowed.\n•  The corners should move in toward the canine/eye teeth.  The corners should\nnever look or feel pulled back.\n•  The corners can move down from the natural position as the student progresses\nbut they can never move up.\n•  The texture of both the upper and lower lip should be very soft and relaxed.\n•  There should be natural space between the inside of the lips and the gums and\nteeth.  This space should not change or feel different when the lips vibrate inside\nthe cup of the mouthpiece.  Please remember the demonstration given in today’s\npresentation.\n•  The back teeth are slightly apart and should feel the same as when the student is\nreading, watching television, etc.  The teeth should not be pressed into each other\nwhen doing these other activities.\n•  Brass instrument embouchures are formed with a natural overbite.  A student with\nan underbite should be steered away from brass instrument.\n•  The thickness of a student’s lips should correspond to the size of the cup of the\nmouthpiece for the chosen instrument.  Students with a very full top or bottom lip\nshould be steered towards low brass instruments rather than French horn.\n•  The bottom of the front of the tongue should lie in the soft tissue area which is\nlocated in the front of the mouth just behind the ridge of the bottom gum.\n•  Remember that when playing the French horn, cheeks will only “puff out” if\nthe air is not freely going into the instrument.\n•  Assuming that the above has been achieved, the embouchure will be formed with\nspecial attention to the following:\n1.  The mouthpiece must be placed in the middle of the mouth—up and\ndown as well as side to side. Two-thirds upper lip and one-third\nbottom lip is also a good rule of thumb if some have trouble with\nplacing the mouthpiece in the middle of the mouth.\n2.  The corners are in their natural position and should be set against the\ncanine/eye teeth.\n3.  The lips must be allowed to freely vibrate in response to the airstream\nrather than made to “buzz” in front of the airstream.\n4.  The lips must feel natural so that air can freely move past them—they\nmust not be pulled back against the teeth or blown away from the teeth\nand gums.\n5.  The students should remember that the mouthpiece “gathers” the air—\nnot the lips.\n6.  There must never be more energy placed against the upper lip than the\nlower lip; hence when playing the French horn, the student will\nslightly turn their head to the left so the leadpipe appears to angle\nslightly downwards from the embouchure. There is a simple trick for\nsetting the mouthpiece angle:\na.  Take the mouthpiece, attached to the leadpipe, and set it\nagainst the teeth.\nb.  Allow the rim to sit so that it hits both upper and lower teeth\nnaturally.\nc.  Wherever this angle is, this is the “default” playing angle for\nthat student (as this is how air will naturally proceed from their\nmouth in the middle register).\n7.  Students must be taught to play “down into the French horn” with the\nbell to the side of the body as it was meant to be played—instead of at\nthe mouthpiece with the bell of the horn into the stomach.\n8.  Regarding playing “off the leg,” or with the bell raised up from the\nleg: this technique is useful for students as they grow taller, as these\nstudents may have to otherwise contort their backs or compromise\nlung capacity to play on the leg. Rather than playing with the bell on\nthe thigh, the right hand bears some of the weight of the horn while\nplaying off the leg. Special attention to upper lip/lower lip pressure is\nneeded when doing this adjustment, as the student may be tempted to\nput extra pressure on the upper lip at first."

    "text": "EUPHONIUM GENERAL TUNING TENDENCIES\nThe Overtone Series\nThere are 7 possible combinations of fingerings:\nOpen\n2\n1\n1-2 (3rd valve alone is about the same length)\n2-3\n1-3 (4)\n1-2-3 (2-4)\nEach valve combination plays a series of slotted notes. Displayed below are all the possible notes that can be played without pressing any valves down (open).\nThe order of valve combinations listed above will lower every note on the staff by a half-step.  The lowest note on the 2nd valve combination would be an A…the 1st valve combination would be an Ab, etc.\nBecause each overtone series is in tune with itself, switching between all 7 will cause tuning tendencies.\nTo overcome a tuning tendency, the following can be done:\nValve slide adjustment\nVowel shape/air direction adjustment\nAlternate fingering\nBefore going over which adjustment should be used when, it is important to go over the specific tuning tendencies.\nSharp Notes\nFlat Notes\nVowel Shape/Air Direction\nVowel shape/air direction is the most common adjustment that will be made with younger students.\nFor the upper register:\nStudents who are above pitch or have a pinched/strident sound are most likely closing their teeth. Remind students that even when making an “ee” vowel shape in the upper register, there should be space between the back teeth.\nStudents who are below pitch or have a weak/unsupported sound are most likely not using fast enough air or their tongue is not arched enough (“ee” vowel shape).\nFor the lower register:\nStudents who are above pitch or have a pinched/thin sound are most likely not playing with a big enough vowel shape. Ask students to drop their jaws and blow warm, calm air through the space between their teeth.\nStudents who are below pitch or have a sagging/dull sound are most likely letting their corner collapse and/or not keeping their corners firm. Remind students that even a relaxed vowel shape and air stream are supported by the same embouchure used to play a concert F.\nThe middle register is a good place for students to practice their flexibility within a note. Create games and exercises for students to manipulate which direction they blow their air (up/down) and the vowel shape they use to change the pitch of a note (while maintaining a characteristic sound).\nTo bend a note up, blow the air higher into the mouthpiece and make the vowel shape smaller.\nTo bend a note down, blow the air lower into the mouthpiece and make the vowel shape bigger.\nEncourage students to perform the aforementioned adjustments on both the mouthpiece alone and on the instrument.\nValve Slide Adjustment\nUnlike the trumpet and tuba, students do not have the luxury of being able to adjust slides for tuning purposes while playing the euphonium.  All slides must be set before playing!\nTuning slides should be set to the following:\nThe main tuning slide should be pulled out and tuned to above the staff Bb.  This will vary from student to student, but most of the time the main tuning slide will be pulled out anywhere from ½ inch to 1 inch.\nThe 1st valve slide should be slightly pulled out about ¼ - ½ inch.\nThe 2nd valve slide does not need to be pulled out at all because of the shortness of slide length and minimal tuning deficiencies while using 2nd valve.\nThe 3rd valve slide can be pulled out to compensate for problematic sharp notes involving third valve.\nThe 4th valve should be pulled out and tuned to low F and 2nd space C.\nAlternate Fingerings\nUsing the overtone series, one can find more options that are not specifically listed.\n3 for above the staff G\n4 or 1-3 for above the staff F\n3 for above the staff A\n4 or 1-3 for 5th line A (if A is very flat)\nThat being said, a band director should only know these fingerings if all else fails. Most alternate fingerings, especially higher notes using more valves than required, will dull the sound and drastically change the pitch. There will be occasions where a student brings his/her own euphonium with very different tuning tendencies and needs an uncommon option.\nWhen it comes to trills, alternate fingerings are completely acceptable. Students should learn that an F#-G trill is easier and cleaner to execute using 3rd valve instead of 1st and 2nd for the G.\nAt the high school level, it is more than acceptable to try fingerings that either darken or brighten the tone for chord balance purposes."

    "text": "EUPHONIUM COMPENSATING SYSTEM\nMost commonly found on more advanced euphoniums; this system is not typically used on beginner instruments.\nThe compensating system works like the F-attachment on trombone.  When 4th valve is depressed, the instrument is pitched in the key of F.\nThe compensating system allows for the possibility to play a full chromatic scale between the 1st and 2nd partials (low B-flat – low E specifically)\nWith all valves depressed on a compensating euphonium (1-2-3-4), the instrument will sound a low B-natural.  That same valve combination on a non-compensating euphonium will only produce a low C.  This makes the low B-natural a non-existent note on a non-compensating horn.\nWhen using a compensating-style instrument, you have the advantage of being able to play lower octaves using conventional fingerings and pressing down 4th valve.  For example, 3rd line D-flat would be played 2-3.  To play the octave below, one would hold depress the 2-3-valve combination and add 4th valve.  This would be a different fingering on a non-compensating euphonium (1-3-4)\nHaving a compensating euphonium is extremely beneficial in extending the lower range chromatically.\n1-3 and 1-2-3 valve combinations can be played 4 and 2-4, respectively, to help with resonance, clarity, and tuning difficulties.\nMost compensating euphoniums will have the 4th valve halfway down the right side of the instrument – this valve is to be played with the left index finger (not the middle finger).\nThe 4th valve is placed down the side of the instrument because of the relative weakness of right hand pinky when playing a “4 valve on top” or “inline 4” style instrument.\nNot all 4 valve instruments are compensating— you must look behind the valves to see if the instrument includes extra tubing that goes through the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd valves."

The same goes for mouthwash. If these are used, simply rinse the mouthpiece thoroughly afterwards and let it air dry so that the alcohol evaporates.\nThis process should be done every week to two weeks.\nSlide Maintenance\nThe insides of the slides and various tubes build up grime, various dirt particles, and germs, so the slides must be snaked at least once a month.\nTo snake a horn:\nTake out the appropriate slide, pressing down the appropriate valve while taking it out, and place the slide on a towel or soft surface.\nRun water through the unattached slide, preferably in the opposite direction of air flow.\nIn the case of the main tuning slide and the lead pipe, also run water through the lead pipe – starting on the end with the tuning slide, not the end with the mouthpiece receiver.\nTake the snake and run it through the slide which was taken out, preferably in the opposite direction of air flow.\nRepeat the above step with all slides, including the main tuning slide, the 1st valve slide, 2nd valve slide, 3rd valve slide, and 4th valve slide.\nApply slide grease as necessary according to the below steps.\nDepending on the model of euphonium, there can be up to 6 slides that require maintenance. Each of these must be well-lubricated with slide grease. Refer to the “Maintenance Kit” handout for pictures of slide greases.\nTo apply the grease:\nTake out the slide to be greased, pressing down the appropriate valve.\nWith some cheesecloth, wipe off the slide to clean the grease and any grime on the slide.\nIf the grease is a liquid, squeeze the bottle and apply a line of grease down two sides of the slide. If the grease is more of a cream, use the index finger to apply the grease along most of the length of the slide.\nDo not apply too much grease, as the slides can become too lubricated and fall out.\nRe-insert the slide and slide it fully in and out a few times. Insert only one side of the slide in and rotate the slide while moving it in and out. Press down the appropriate valve the entire time during this process.\nPush the slide all the way in and use a paper towel to wipe off any extra grease located where the immovable and movable parts of the slide meet.\nRepeat this process for all slides as needed.\nThis process should be done every month or so.\nValve Maintenance\nIf consistently played on, a euphonium should have no “sticky valves” for a few weeks.\nOn the other hand, a euphonium that is not played on for 2-3 days in a row the valve can begin to stick.\nTo re-oil the valves:\nBegin twisting from the top valve cap until the cap comes off of the valve casing.\nHolding the valve by the finger button, completely remove the valve without twisting or rotating it inside the casing.\nWith some cheesecloth, wipe down any old oil from the piston.\nApply a healthy coat of oil on the whole piston, but do not intentionally apply any oil inside the ports as it will simply go to waste once air is blown through the horn.\nTake a look inside the valve casing:\nThere should be two notches on the sides of the valve casing; this is where the guides on the valve will be placed.\nOne notch should be slightly bigger/different from the other one. Be sure to align the correct guide with the correct slot.\nCarefully insert the valve, without twisting or rotating it, inside the appropriate valve casing.\nRepeat for any other “sticky” valves.\nEUPHONIUM METHOD BOOKS\nSUPPLEMENTAL EUPHONIUM BOOKS\nEUPHONIUM CASES, IDENTIFICATION OF PARTS AND REMOVING IT FROM ITS CASE\nGeneral Information About All Brass Cases\nMost cases have distinguishing marks somewhere on the case.  Identify these marks, and their relationship to the top and bottom of the case.  Most cases have the handles placed on the bottom section of each case.  Check to make sure.\nPlace all euphonium cases on the floor in front of the student.\nBe sure the student understands where and which direction each part of the instrument belongs in the case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make sure the student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure the parts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse order they were removed.\nThe euphonium should be removed first, followed by the mouthpiece.  When putting instrument back, the order is reversed – mouthpiece first, followed by the euphonium.\nAll instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure explicitly every time.\nNever leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up, but this is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.  Check each opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to your students.\nCases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom setup for each student’s case.  If using an ensemble room for the class, the cases may be opened in the hall.  The empty case will remain closed and latched in the hall during class.\nWhen instruments are in their cases, do not allow students to sit on their cases AT ANY TIME because the lead pipe, bell, and/or compensating valve will get bent.\nPARTS OF THE EUPHONIUM\nEUPHONIUM INSTRUMENT/BODY RATIO AND\nInstrument/Body Ratio/Instrument Carriage\nAssuming that the student is either standing or sitting with correct posture, instruct them to pick up the body of the euphonium with both hands and simply lift it by using their arms.  Move the instrument up and down, side to side, higher than usual and lower than usual.  As students are doing this, have them notice how it affects the balance of the body.  Eventually, the body should feel as balanced with or without the instrument in hand.\nMake sure students bring instruments to them… and not them to the instruments.  When done incorrectly, their body collapses and their air is obstructed.\nUse of rolled up towels with rubber bands (or other “assists”) for euphoniums are beneficial for correct posture and positioning of instrument.\nShoulders should be straight across when facing the director and it should feel the same way when doing breathing exercises  (do not twist or shift the upper body out of the breathing position)\nThe euphonium should not be slanted in a manner in which moves the students’ head from its natural position.\nAngles of mouthpieces should be slightly lower than level.\nHand Position\nThe most natural shape of everyone’s hands forms a flat “C”.\nAll hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall behind the wrist.\nThere should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the euphonium.\nThe inside of the arms must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding the euphonium correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\nElbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be hampered.\nThough not a part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling the instrument toward the student’s face.  Instruct students to keep their elbows soft while playing the euphonium.\nThe side/very tip of the right hand thumb should be the only thing that touches the bottom of the cross brace.\nThe euphonium right hand thumb and 1st finger should point in same direction.  The thumb should not be wrapped around the valve casing (older, three valve instruments)…which results in the palm collapsing into the cross brace.\nPiston valves are approached basically the same as trumpet.  Rotary valves are basically approached the same as French horn.\nPlace both the left and the right hand in their correct position.  Remember the left hand does not “grip” the instrument.  No tension should be felt in this hand when holding the instrument.\nThe thumb must never bend in any direction!  The index, middle and ring fingers are curved and the fleshy part of the fingertips is placed on the pearls of the valve caps and should never lose contact with the caps.  On a three valve euphonium, the pinky is slightly curved and in the air, as if there was a fourth valve.\nRight hand fingers should have curvature; the pads of the fingers should not extend past the pearls, which incorrectly results students playing with flat fingers.\nThe palms of both hands should feel soft.  The palm of the right hand should never touch the instrument or cross brace.  The teacher should be able to clearly see a “circular” opening between the right hand and the instrument.  The palm of the left hand should be placed along the 3rd valve slide and side of the instrument (similar to holding a baby).  On a compensating euphonium, the left index finger is curved and the fleshy part of the fingertip is placed on the pearl of the valve cap.\nStudents with compensating fourth valves must move their left hand index finger (NOT second finger) in the same manner that they move their other valves.  The middle, ring and pinky are beneath/next to the valve casing.\nThe left hand should not contain any tension, as it holds the majority of the weight of the instrument.\nThe student should understand that finger movement is aided by the soft tissue of the palm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand.\nEUPHONIUM FACE/EMBOUCHURE\nEach student should use their own “safe/unbreakable” mirror—both in the classroom and at home.\nUsing the mirror, have each student notice how natural their face looks.  They will have to later remember and memorize how it looks and feels.\nThe head must be balanced on the shoulders in a comfortable position—not too far forward and not too far backward.\nThe eyes should be soft and natural, and the “sight line” should be exactly level.  The distance between eyebrows should not change as air goes in and out of the body.\nLook for natural creases in the face, and allow any that are naturally present to exist while playing.  No other creases are allowed.\nThe corners should move in toward the canine/eye teeth.  The corners should never look or feel pulled back.\nThe corners can move down from the natural position as the student progresses but they can never move up.\nThe texture of both the upper and lower lip should be very soft and relaxed.\nThere should be natural space between the inside of the lips and the gums and teeth.  This space should not change or feel different when the lips vibrate inside the cup of the mouthpiece.\nThe back teeth are slightly apart and should feel the same as when the student is reading, watching television, etc.  The teeth should not be pressed into each other when doing these other activities.\nBrass instrument embouchures are formed with a natural overbite.  A student with an underbite should be steered away from brass instrument.\nThe thickness of a student’s lips should correspond to the size of the cup of the mouthpiece for the chosen instrument.  Students with a very full top or bottom lip should be steered towards low brass instruments rather than trumpet.\nThe bottom of the front of the tongue should lie in the soft tissue area which is located in the front of the mouth just behind the ridge of the bottom gum.\nRemember that when playing the euphonium, cheeks will only “puff out” if the air is not freely going into the instrument.\nAssuming that the above has been achieved, the embouchure will be formed with special attention to the following:\nThe mouthpiece must be placed in the middle of the mouth—up and down as well as side to side.\nThe corners are in their natural position and should be set against the canine/eye teeth.\nThe lips must be allowed to freely vibrate in response to the airstream rather than made to “buzz” in front of the airstream.\nThe lips must feel natural so that air can freely move past them—they must not be pulled back against the teeth or blown away from the teeth and gums.\nThe students should remember that the mouthpiece “gathers” the air—not the lips.\nThere must never be more energy placed against the upper lip than the lower lip; hence the instrument will angle slightly downwards.\nEUPHONIUM ARTICULATION\nThe tongue moves in the same manner when articulating a brass instrument as it does when you speak.  The tongue moves up and down—not back and forth—both when speaking and when articulation on an instrument.\nThe purpose of the tongue is to release the air, which causes the lips to vibrate and creates the sound. The tongue’s release of the air simply defines the beginning/start of the vibration/sound.\nArticulation is used to define the vibrations necessary to create musical rhythm, style and movement-- to contrast the use of slurring (which also creates similar musical entities).\nThe students should think that the tongue “articulates” the sound created by the airstream.  If the student is taught to create the sound correctly, articulation will be an easy transition.\nsound occurs when the air moves past the naturally vibrating lips\narticulate the sound that is already present\nteach students to articulate at the moment the sound begins\nWithout the instrument or mouthpiece, use the following procedure:\n1.   Say the word “DOG”.\nSing the syllable “DAH”.\nOnce these are mastered, have the student use the mouthpiece and instrument and reproduce the “DAH” syllable in their brain to create an articulated sound.\nThe tongue should feel the same when saying, singing and playing the mouthpiece and instrument.\nThe tongue should touch the enamel of the upper teeth directly below the gum line—in the same spot with the same strength every time.\nUse the syllable “DAH” because it creates smoother and more easily controlled air as opposed to the “TAH” syllable.\nAfter each “articulation”, the tongue must immediately fall down into its natural “at rest” position.\nThe tongue will be naturally soft at all times, but can touch the teeth with different strengths.\nThe tongue will be in its “down position” 98% of the time when articulating correctly.\nHave the student start their sound with the air.\nUsing the information about the basics of articulation, have the student articulate as fast as they can with no limitations of numbers, worries about evenness of articulation, etc.  Simply get them used to articulating!\nHave the student then use the “ta-day” syllable to practice using the tongue in an organized manner.\nHave the student then articulate “on command.”  The student will start their sound, and articulate when you snap your fingers to practice gaining more control of the tongue.\nOnce the student understands pulse and the foot pat, have the student articulate exactly when the toe of the foot touches the floor.\nHave the student articulate with the down and up position of the foot.\nProceed to written rhythms as they begin to read music.\nAlways practice this entire routine.  The student must always go through the entire process, so he will not lose the ability to move his tongue at various speeds and in a structured manner.\nEUPHONIUM FLEXIBILITY AND\nRANGE EXTENSION\nBrass playing is based upon flexibility.\nThere are two types of flexibility: flexibility within the instrument and flexibility within the note.\nStudents eventually need to be flexible through each of the harmonic series in order to move up and down within the range of the instrument.\nOnce the student can reproduce at will a given pitch, the teacher must decide whether flexibility up or down is needed first.\nFlexibility is controlled by air direction and the isometrics created by the corners and canine/eye teeth.  The head must always stay in its natural, balanced position at all times.  The angle of the instrument must not change at any time.\nStudents must learn to angle the air in the cup of the mouthpiece without changing the position of the lips and/or the relationship of the upper and lower teeth.\nFlexibility is also enhanced by vowel sounds used in various registers.  These sounds can be “ah” for the middle register….”ee” for the upper register….and “oh” for the lower register.  Have students practice saying these vowel sounds with vocalization on appropriate lower, middle and higher sounds.\nThe speed of the air and the shape of the vowel guide flexibility.  The tongue assists the air speed similar to the way one’s thumb assists the water speed from a hose.  The tongue relaxes when descending into the lower register and arches when ascending into the upper register.\nBring to the students’ attention that the shape of the tongue changes dramatically from vowel sound to vowel sound.  All students should be aware that vowel sounds are the middles of words that they speak every day.  Practice saying words that use the required vowel sounds (i.e.  bow, ball, beep).\nRange is developed through flexibility.  It is more important to create a resonant sound while practicing flexibility than to create wider intervals.  The student can enhance their range by making more resonant sounds in the middle register before trying to extend higher or lower.\nWhile it is important to create resonant sounds in the register students can play in, it is important for students to occasionally try exploring both the upper and lower range they struggle to make a good sound in.  This should be practiced perhaps twice a week.\nMake sure students understand the texture of the lips have nothing to do with range. For example, students should never be told to “tighten” their lips in order to play in the higher register.\nEUPHONIUM COMPENSATING SYSTEM\nMost commonly found on more advanced euphoniums; this system is not typically used on beginner instruments.\nThe compensating system works like the F-attachment on trombone.  When 4th valve is depressed, the instrument is pitched in the key of F.\nThe compensating system allows for the possibility to play a full chromatic scale between the 1st and 2nd partials (low B-flat – low E specifically)\nWith all valves depressed on a compensating euphonium (1-2-3-4), the instrument will sound a low B-natural.  That same valve combination on a non-compensating euphonium will only produce a low C.  This makes the low B-natural a non-existent note on a non-compensating horn.\nWhen using a compensating-style instrument, you have the advantage of being able to play lower octaves using conventional fingerings and pressing down 4th valve.  For example, 3rd line D-flat would be played 2-3.  To play the octave below, one would hold depress the 2-3-valve combination and add 4th valve.  This would be a different fingering on a non-compensating euphonium (1-3-4)\nHaving a compensating euphonium is extremely beneficial in extending the lower range chromatically.\n1-3 and 1-2-3 valve combinations can be played 4 and 2-4, respectively, to help with resonance, clarity, and tuning difficulties.\nMost compensating euphoniums will have the 4th valve halfway down the right side of the instrument – this valve is to be played with the left index finger (not the middle finger).\nThe 4th valve is placed down the side of the instrument because of the relative weakness of right hand pinky when playing a “4 valve on top” or “inline 4” style instrument.\nNot all 4 valve instruments are compensating— you must look behind the valves to see if the instrument includes extra tubing that goes through the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd valves.\nEUPHONIUM GENERAL TUNING TENDENCIES\nThe Overtone Series\nThere are 7 possible combinations of fingerings:\nOpen\n2\n1\n1-2 (3rd valve alone is about the same length)\n2-3\n1-3 (4)\n1-2-3 (2-4)\nEach valve combination plays a series of slotted notes. Displayed below are all the possible notes that can be played without pressing any valves down (open).\nThe order of valve combinations listed above will lower every note on the staff by a half-step.  The lowest note on the 2nd valve combination would be an A…the 1st valve combination would be an Ab, etc.\nBecause each overtone series is in tune with itself, switching between all 7 will cause tuning tendencies.\nTo overcome a tuning tendency, the following can be done:\nValve slide adjustment\nVowel shape/air direction adjustment\nAlternate fingering\nBefore going over which adjustment should be used when, it is important to go over the specific tuning tendencies.\nSharp Notes\nFlat Notes\nVowel Shape/Air Direction\nVowel shape/air direction is the most common adjustment that will be made with younger students.\nFor the upper register:\nStudents who are above pitch or have a pinched/strident sound are most likely closing their teeth. Remind students that even when making an “ee” vowel shape in the upper register, there should be space between the back teeth.\nStudents who are below pitch or have a weak/unsupported sound are most likely not using fast enough air or their tongue is not arched enough (“ee” vowel shape).\nFor the lower register:\nStudents who are above pitch or have a pinched/thin sound are most likely not playing with a big enough vowel shape. Ask students to drop their jaws and blow warm, calm air through the space between their teeth.\nStudents who are below pitch or have a sagging/dull sound are most likely letting their corner collapse and/or not keeping their corners firm. Remind students that even a relaxed vowel shape and air stream are supported by the same embouchure used to play a concert F.\nThe middle register is a good place for students to practice their flexibility within a note. Create games and exercises for students to manipulate which direction they blow their air (up/down) and the vowel shape they use to change the pitch of a note (while maintaining a characteristic sound).\nTo bend a note up, blow the air higher into the mouthpiece and make the vowel shape smaller.\nTo bend a note down, blow the air lower into the mouthpiece and make the vowel shape bigger.\nEncourage students to perform the aforementioned adjustments on both the mouthpiece alone and on the instrument.\nValve Slide Adjustment\nUnlike the trumpet and tuba, students do not have the luxury of being able to adjust slides for tuning purposes while playing the euphonium.  All slides must be set before playing!\nTuning slides should be set to the following:\nMain tuning slide pulled out to have concert F and above the staff Bb in tune (will vary from player to player, but most of the time will be anywhere from ½ inch to 1 inch).\nFirst valve slide should be slightly pulled out.\nSecond valve slide does not need to be pulled out at all because of the shortness of slide length and minimal tuning deficiencies while using second valve.\nThird valve slide can be pulled out to compensate for problematic sharp notes.\n4th valve should be pulled out to have low F and in the staff C in tune.\nAlternate Fingerings\nUsing the overtone series, one can find more options that are not specifically listed.\n3 for above the staff G\n4 or 1-3 for above the staff F\n3 for above the staff A\n4 or 1-3 for 5th line A (if A is very flat)\nThat being said, a band director should only know these fingerings if all else fails. Most alternate fingerings, especially higher notes using more valves than required, will dull the sound and drastically change the pitch. There will be occasions where a student brings his/her own euphonium with very different tuning tendencies and needs an uncommon option.\nWhen it comes to trills, alternate fingerings are completely acceptable. Students should learn that an F#-G trill is easier and cleaner to execute using 3rd valve instead of 1st and 2nd for the G.\nAt the high school level, it is more than acceptable to try fingerings that either darken or brighten the tone for chord balance purposes."

The\nbore size is the inside diameter of the lead pipe. Small bore trombones are\ntypically .500- inch and large bore trombones are typically .547-inch.\no  Small shank mouthpieces refer to mouthpieces that can fit on a straight\ntrombone or small bore euphonium.\no  Large shank mouthpieces refer to mouthpieces that can fit on trombone\nwith large bores (typically, those with secondary attachments) and\neuphoniums with large bores.\no  Mouthpiece adapters are made for people playing on small shank\nmouthpieces to play on a large bore instrument. Do not use mouthpiece\nadapters, if possible – try to play on small shank mouthpieces for small\nbore instruments and large shank mouthpieces for large bore instruments.\nThis is to maintain the integrity of the proportions that the instruments\nwere designed to sound best on.\n  Silver vs. gold plating\no  There has been much controversy surrounding the issue of playing on\nsilver-plated or gold-plated mouthpieces. These include the following:\n  Endurance\n  Tone quality\n  Ease of playing\n  Overall embouchure health\no  So what is the truth? Because the embouchure is incredibly personal and\ncan only be truly determined and developed on an individual level, the\nissue, as a whole, does not really matter. Students will discover what\nworks best for them as they develop, and they should only do so under the\nsupervision of an experienced band director and/or private lesson\ninstructor.\no  It is recommended to start beginners on a silver mouthpiece. A silver\nmouthpiece is cheaper, and because it is uncertain whether or not the\nstudent will have embouchure issues on the onset, there is no need to have\nstudents start on a gold mouthpiece (which is twice as expensive).\nEUPHONIUM MAINTENANCE KIT LIST –\nRECOMMENDED ITEMS\nAl Cass Valve Oil\nMSRP $6.59 @ wwbw.com\n  Students should oil valves at least\nonce a day\n________________________________________________________________________\nSelmer Tuning Slide & Cork\nGrease\nMSRP $3.99 @ jwpepper.com\n  The Selmer cork grease is a liquid\nand lasts much longer than most\ntuning slide greases.\n  Caution should be used when using\nthis because it is very sticky\n  Must be stored in a plastic Ziploc\n\nbag as it may explode.\nIf it hits something in the case or if\nexposed to heat, it will damage\nother maintenance kit items.\n  To apply, squeeze a tiny bit of the\ngrease up and down onto the slide.\nThen, insert slide back into the\ninstrument using a back and forth\nmotion until lubricated. Remove\nany excess grease with a cloth from\nthe slide if necessary.\nDenis Wick Flexible\nEuphonium Snake Brush\nMSRP $16.99 at wwbw.com\n  A snake is used to clean the inner\nand outer slides at least every six\nmonths\n  Be sure to not use metal snakes,\nas they will scratch the plating of\nthe horn.\nYamaha Brass Mouthpiece\nBrush\nMSRP $2.99 @ wwbw.com\n  Used to clean the inside of the\nmouthpiece\nInsert from the shank and twist\nto clean out the mouthpiece.\n  Does not go all the way through\nthe mouthpiece.\n  Could scratch the inside of the\ncup of the mouthpiece if not\nused correctly.\nDenis Wick Valve Casing Brush\nMSRP $10.99 @ wwbw.com\n  Used to clean inside valve casing of\nthe euphonium.\n  Must take out entire valve, spring,\nand top and bottom valve caps.\nThe Ultimate BERP\nTrombone/Euphonium Small\nShank\nMSRP $24.99 @ wwbw.com\n  The BERP allows students to air,\nposition, and vibrate while\nsimulating playing position. It is a\ngood tool for ear training as the\nstudent advances.\n8x10 Plexiglass\nBinswangerglass.com\n  Road man will not supply these\n  Prices vary depending on where mirrors are\npurchased.\n  Mirrors purchased through Binswanger can\nbe purchased in bulk and cut to a desired\nsize. They will also be made of plexiglass.\n  Purchasing mirrors at a home improvement\nstore is also an option; however, mirrors\nwill have to be individually cut by a band\nparent or yourself.\n  No matter where mirrors are purchased, it\nis vital that they are made of plexiglass and\nnot glass. Students will not hurt themselves\non the corners of the mirrors; nor will the\nmirrors shatter when dropped.\n  To receive a better price, attempt to find\nother band directors who would be willing\nto place an order as well. Assuring the\ncompany that you will place annual orders\nmay also result in a discount.\n  Self-portrait mirrors from art supply stores\nare acceptable.\n  Car clip-on mirrors are not recommended\nbecause they are too small and the hinges\nbreak easily.\n  Makeup mirrors are not recommended\nbecause they are too small and oddly\nshaped.\nIt would be best if there was a box for the\nmirrors in each separate class location.\nStudents can then easily obtain a mirror out\nof the box before class and return the\nmirror after class.\nEUPHONIUM MAINTENANCE KIT –\nOPTIONAL RECOMMENDED ITEMS\nHetman 7 or 8 – Premium Slide Grease\nStandard\nMSRP $9.00 @ wwbw.com\n  The Hetman Slide Grease is a cream and\nlasts much longer than most tuning slide\ngreases.\n  Caution should be used when using this\nbecause it is very sticky\n  To apply, remove a small amount of\ncream from container and smear onto\nslide. Then, making a ring with the\nthumb and forefinger, work the slide\ngrease onto the slide to create enough\nfriction to properly lubricate the cork.\nInsert slide back into the instrument using\na back and forth motion until lubricated.\nRemove any excess grease with a cloth\nfrom the slide if necessary\nBach Deluxe Silver Polishing Cloth\nMSRP $12.00 @ wwbw.com\n  A silver polishing cloth is helpful in\nmaintenance of a euphonium, as it may\naccumulate many fingerprints and a lot of\ndust that will destroy the lacquered finish\nof the brass.\n  The silver polishing cloth is specifically\ndesigned to prolong the life of the finish\nof a silver brass instrument.\n  Removes moisture, acid, excess valve oil,\nand slide grease from the student’s\nfingers.\nProtec A204 Large Brass Deluxe\nPadded Mouthpiece Pouch\nMSRP $9.95 @ wwbw.com\n  Students can carry mouthpieces home\nwithout instrument cases every day to\nand from school.\n  Padding and nonabrasive lining prevent\ndents, dings, and scrapes.\n  Provides more protection than Ziploc\nbags.\nOne of the following can be used depending on socio-economic environment, availability, or\npreference when selecting a suitable metronome.\nQwik Time QT-5 Metronome\nMSRP $7.95 @ wwbw.com\n  This metronome does not have a\nsubdivision function.\n  Credit card-sized\n  A-440 tuning tone\n  Low-battery indicator\nKorg MA-1 Metronome\n  Beat-Counting display makes it easier to\npractice rhythm and phrasing.\n  Tap Tempo function makes it easier to\nquickly set the desired tempo.\n  Beat display offers from 1 to 9 beats,\nplus 8 rhythm types to practice any style\nof music.\n  Can tune any instrument using the 12-\nstep (C4 – B4) chromatic reference\npitch\n  Adjustable calibration setting (410 –\n480 Hz)\n  Earphone jack with adjustable volume\n  Memory backup function and auto\npower-off function\n  Up to approximately 290 hours of\ncontinuous operation\nKorg TM-50 Digital Tuner/\nMetronome\nMSRP $29.99 @ wwbw.com\n  Offers both a tuner and metronome,\nwhich function simultaneously or\nindependently\n  Contains 13 types of rhythms that cover\n0-7 beats per measure as well as\ndoublets, triplets, triplets with center\nbeats omitted, quadruplets, and\nquadruplets with center beats omitted\n  Tempo is easily adjustable in a range of\n40—208BPM.\nOne of the following music stands can be chosen depending on socio-economic environment,\navailability, or preference.\nHamilton Folding Music Stand\nMSRP $10.79 @ wwbw.com\n  Collapsible and easy to transport\nSelmer Music Stand with Bag\nMSRP $26.95 @ wwbw.com\nEUPHONIUM MAINTENANCE\nMouthpiece Maintenance\n  Over time, grime and other dirty objects build up in the mouthpiece.\n  To clean the mouthpiece:\n1.  Take a mouthpiece brush and run it through the mouthpiece under warm\nwater in the sink.\n  The brush will not go all the way through, so insert the brush to the\nthroat, twist and pull out.\n  Soap is not necessary, but it does not hurt the mouthpiece to use it.\nThe same goes for mouthwash. If these are used, simply rinse the\nmouthpiece thoroughly afterwards and let it air dry so that the\nalcohol evaporates.\n  This process should be done every week to two weeks.\nSlide Maintenance\n  The insides of the slides and various tubes build up grime, various dirt particles,\nand germs, so the slides must be snaked at least once a month.\n  To snake a horn:\n1.  Take out the appropriate slide, pressing down the appropriate valve while\ntaking it out, and place the slide on a towel or soft surface.\n2.  Run water through the unattached slide, preferably in the opposite\ndirection of air flow.\n\nIn the case of the main tuning slide and the lead pipe, also run\nwater through the lead pipe – starting on the end with the tuning\nslide, not the end with the mouthpiece receiver.\n3.  Take the snake and run it through the slide which was taken out,\npreferably in the opposite direction of air flow.\n4.  Repeat the above step with all slides, including the main tuning slide, the\n1st valve slide, 2nd valve slide, 3rd valve slide, and 4th valve slide.\n5.  Apply slide grease as necessary according to the below steps.\n  Depending on the model of euphonium, there can be up to 6 slides that require\nmaintenance. Each of these must be well-lubricated with slide grease. Refer to the\n“Maintenance Kit” handout for pictures of slide greases.\n  To apply the grease:\n1.  Take out the slide to be greased, pressing down the appropriate valve.\n2.  With some cheesecloth, wipe off the slide to clean the grease and any\ngrime on the slide.\n3.  If the grease is a liquid, squeeze the bottle and apply a line of grease down\ntwo sides of the slide. If the grease is more of a cream, use the index finger\nto apply the grease along most of the length of the slide.\n  Do not apply too much grease, as the slides can become too\nlubricated and fall out.\n4.  Re-insert the slide and slide it fully in and out a few times. Insert only one\nside of the slide in and rotate the slide while moving it in and out. Press\ndown the appropriate valve the entire time during this process.\n5.  Push the slide all the way in and use a paper towel to wipe off any extra\ngrease located where the immovable and movable parts of the slide meet.\n6.  Repeat this process for all slides as needed.\n  This process should be done every month or so.\nValve Maintenance\nIf consistently played on, a euphonium should have no “sticky valves” for a few\nweeks.\n  On the other hand, a euphonium that is not played on for 2-3 days in a row the\nvalve can begin to stick.\n  To re-oil the valves:\n1.  Begin twisting from the top valve cap until the cap comes off of the valve\ncasing.\n2.  Holding the valve by the finger button, completely remove the valve\nwithout twisting or rotating it inside the casing.\n3.  With some cheesecloth, wipe down any old oil from the piston.\n4.  Apply a healthy coat of oil on the whole piston, but do not intentionally\napply any oil inside the ports as it will simply go to waste once air is\nblown through the horn.\n5.  Take a look inside the valve casing:\n  There should be two notches on the sides of the valve casing; this\nis where the guides on the valve will be placed.\n  One notch should be slightly bigger/different from the other one.\nBe sure to align the correct guide with the correct slot.\n6.  Carefully insert the valve, without twisting or rotating it, inside the\nappropriate valve casing.\n7.  Repeat for any other “sticky” valves.\nEUPHONIUM METHOD BOOKS\nEssential Elements 2000\nMSRP $8.99\n@ wwbw.com\nStandard of Excellence\nMSRP $6.95\nBest in Class\nMSRP $5.45\nAccent on Achievement\nMSRP $7.95\nSUPPLEMENTAL EUPHONIUM BOOKS\nMelodious Etudes for\nTrombone by Carl Fischer\narr. by Joannes Rochut\nMSRP $19.95\nUsed for lyrical playing\nand musical phrasing for\nAdvanced Method for\nEuphonium by Rubank\nMSRP $5.99\nA more advanced book\nwith etudes and scales\nTechnical Studies for Bass\nClef Instruments by Clarke-\nGordon\nMSRP $16.99\nGood technique-building\nexercises for all ages and\nlevels of playing\nSixty Selected Studies for\nTrombone by Kopprasch\nMSRP $8.95-$9.99\n@ halleonard.com\nUsed for trombone players\nand adopted by\neuphonium teachers, this\nbook contains many\ndifferent techniques and\nincorporates different clefs\nthroughout the book\nThe Brass Gym by Patrick\nSheridan and Sam Pilafian\nMSRP $39.95 @\njustforbrass.com\nGreat warm up book and\nfundamentals with scalar\npatterns.\nCD included\nComplete Method for\nTrombone and Euphonium\nby John Baptiste Arban\nMSRP $56.95\n@ hickeys.com\nScales, arpeggios,\nintervals, multiple\ntonguing exercises, duets,\nand technical solos\nIncludes 12\nCharacteristic Studies that\nmay be used for TMEA\nAll-State euphonium\nmusic\nSpiral bound with\ncomments by Joseph\nAlessi and Dr. Brian\nBowman\nSelected Studies for\nEuphonium by H.

Identify these\nmarks, and their relationship to the top and bottom of the case.  Most cases have\nthe handles placed on the bottom section of each case.  Check to make sure.\n  Place all euphonium cases on the floor in front of the student.\n  Be sure the student understands where and which direction each part of the\ninstrument belongs in the case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts\nfrom the case.  Make sure the student waits for each instruction before performing\nthe task.  Be sure the parts of the instrument are returned to the case in the reverse\norder they were removed.\n  The euphonium should be removed first, followed by the mouthpiece.  When\nputting instrument back, the order is reversed – mouthpiece first, followed by the\neuphonium.\n  All instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure\nexplicitly every time.\n  Never leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up, but\nthis is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.  Check\neach opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to your\nstudents.\n  Cases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom\nsetup for each student’s case.  If using an ensemble room for the class, the cases\nmay be opened in the hall.  The empty case will remain closed and latched in the\nhall during class.\n  When instruments are in their cases, do not allow students to sit on their cases AT\nANY TIME because the lead pipe, bell, and/or compensating valve will get bent.\nPARTS OF THE EUPHONIUM\nValves\nBell\nLeadpipe\nMouthpiece\n2nd Valve\nSlide\n3rd Valve\nWater\nKeys\n1st Valve\nTuning Slide\nEUPHONIUM INSTRUMENT/BODY\nRATIO AND\nInstrument/Body Ratio/Instrument Carriage\n  Assuming that the student is either standing or sitting with correct posture, instruct\nthem to pick up the body of the euphonium with both hands and simply lift it by using\ntheir arms.  Move the instrument up and down, side to side, higher than usual and\nlower than usual.  As students are doing this, have them notice how it affects the\nbalance of the body.  Eventually, the body should feel as balanced with or without the\ninstrument in hand.\n  Make sure students bring instruments to them… and not them to the instruments.\nWhen done incorrectly, their body collapses and their air is obstructed.\n  Use of rolled up towels with rubber bands (or other “assists”) for euphoniums are\nbeneficial for correct posture and positioning of instrument.\n  Shoulders should be straight across when facing the director and it should feel the\nsame way when doing breathing exercises  (do not twist or shift the upper body out of\nthe breathing position)\n  The euphonium should not be slanted in a manner in which moves the students’ head\nfrom its natural position.\n  Angles of mouthpieces should be slightly lower than level.\nHand Position\n1.  The most natural shape of everyone’s hands forms a flat “C”.\n2.  All hands will fall in from the wrist.  The body of the hand must never fall behind the\nwrist.\n3.  There should be no bends or wrinkles in either arm when holding the euphonium.\n4.  The inside of the arms must never touch the outside of the chest cavity when holding\nthe euphonium correctly.  No body part touches another body part!\n5.  Elbows must hang naturally so the natural slope of the shoulders will not be\nhampered.\n6.  Though not a part of the hand, the elbows must never feel as though they are pulling\nthe instrument toward the student’s face.  Instruct students to keep their elbows soft\nwhile playing the euphonium.\n7.  The side/very tip of the right hand thumb should be the only thing that touches the\nbottom of the cross brace.\n8.  The euphonium right hand thumb and 1st finger should point in same direction.  The\nthumb should not be wrapped around the valve casing (older, three valve\ninstruments)…which results in the palm collapsing into the cross brace.\n9.  Piston valves are approached basically the same as trumpet.  Rotary valves are\nbasically approached the same as French horn.\n10. Place both the left and the right hand in their correct position.  Remember the left\nhand does not “grip” the instrument.  No tension should be felt in this hand when\nholding the instrument.\n11. The thumb must never bend in any direction!  The index, middle and ring fingers are\ncurved and the fleshy part of the fingertips is placed on the pearls of the valve caps\nand should never lose contact with the caps.  On a three valve euphonium, the pinky\nis slightly curved and in the air, as if there was a fourth valve.\n12. Right hand fingers should have curvature; the pads of the fingers should not extend\npast the pearls, which incorrectly results students playing with flat fingers.\n13. The palms of both hands should feel soft.  The palm of the right hand should never\ntouch the instrument or cross brace.  The teacher should be able to clearly see a\n“circular” opening between the right hand and the instrument.  The palm of the left\nhand should be placed along the 3rd valve slide and side of the instrument (similar to\nholding a baby).  On a compensating euphonium, the left index finger is curved and\nthe fleshy part of the fingertip is placed on the pearl of the valve cap.\n14. Students with compensating fourth valves must move their left hand index finger\n(NOT second finger) in the same manner that they move their other valves.  The\nmiddle, ring and pinky are beneath/next to the valve casing.\n15. The left hand should not contain any tension, as it holds the majority of the weight of\nthe instrument.\n16. The student should understand that finger movement is aided by the soft tissue of the\npalm of the hand, rather than the bony texture of the top of the hand.\nEUPHONIUM FACE/EMBOUCHURE\n  Each student should use their own “safe/unbreakable” mirror—both in the\nclassroom and at home.\nUsing the mirror, have each student notice how natural their face looks.  They\nwill have to later remember and memorize how it looks and feels.\n  The head must be balanced on the shoulders in a comfortable position—not too\nfar forward and not too far backward.\n  The eyes should be soft and natural, and the “sight line” should be exactly level.\nThe distance between eyebrows should not change as air goes in and out of the\nbody.\n  Look for natural creases in the face, and allow any that are naturally present to\nexist while playing.  No other creases are allowed.\n  The corners should move in toward the canine/eye teeth.  The corners should\nnever look or feel pulled back.\n  The corners can move down from the natural position as the student progresses\nbut they can never move up.\n  The texture of both the upper and lower lip should be very soft and relaxed.\n  There should be natural space between the inside of the lips and the gums and\nteeth.  This space should not change or feel different when the lips vibrate inside\nthe cup of the mouthpiece.\n  The back teeth are slightly apart and should feel the same as when the student is\nreading, watching television, etc.  The teeth should not be pressed into each other\nwhen doing these other activities.\n  Brass instrument embouchures are formed with a natural overbite.  A student with\nan underbite should be steered away from brass instrument.\n  The thickness of a student’s lips should correspond to the size of the cup of the\nmouthpiece for the chosen instrument.  Students with a very full top or bottom lip\nshould be steered towards low brass instruments rather than trumpet.\n  The bottom of the front of the tongue should lie in the soft tissue area which is\nlocated in the front of the mouth just behind the ridge of the bottom gum.\n  Remember that when playing the euphonium, cheeks will only “puff out” if\nthe air is not freely going into the instrument.\n  Assuming that the above has been achieved, the embouchure will be formed with\nspecial attention to the following:\n1.  The mouthpiece must be placed in the middle of the mouth—up and\ndown as well as side to side.\n2.  The corners are in their natural position and should be set against the\ncanine/eye teeth.\n3.  The lips must be allowed to freely vibrate in response to the airstream\nrather than made to “buzz” in front of the airstream.\n4.  The lips must feel natural so that air can freely move past them—they\nmust not be pulled back against the teeth or blown away from the teeth\nand gums.\n5.  The students should remember that the mouthpiece “gathers” the air—\nnot the lips.\n6.  There must never be more energy placed against the upper lip than the\nlower lip; hence the instrument will angle slightly downwards.\nEUPHONIUM ARTICULATION\n  The tongue moves in the same manner when articulating a brass instrument as it\ndoes when you speak.  The tongue moves up and down—not back and forth—\nboth when speaking and when articulation on an instrument.\n  The purpose of the tongue is to release the air, which causes the lips to vibrate and\ncreates the sound. The tongue’s release of the air simply defines the\nbeginning/start of the vibration/sound.\n  Articulation is used to define the vibrations necessary to create musical rhythm,\nstyle and movement-- to contrast the use of slurring (which also creates similar\nmusical entities).\n  The students should think that the tongue “articulates” the sound created by the\nairstream.  If the student is taught to create the sound correctly, articulation will\nbe an easy transition.\na.  sound occurs when the air moves past the naturally vibrating lips\nb.  articulate the sound that is already present\nc.  teach students to articulate at the moment the sound begins\n  Without the instrument or mouthpiece, use the following procedure:\n1.   Say the word “DOG”.\n2.  Sing the syllable “DAH”.\n3.  Once these are mastered, have the student use the mouthpiece and\ninstrument and reproduce the “DAH” syllable in their brain to create\nan articulated sound.\n4.  The tongue should feel the same when saying, singing and playing the\nmouthpiece and instrument.\n5.  The tongue should touch the enamel of the upper teeth directly below\nthe gum line—in the same spot with the same strength every time.\n6.  Use the syllable “DAH” because it creates smoother and more easily\ncontrolled air as opposed to the “TAH” syllable.\n7.  After each “articulation”, the tongue must immediately fall down into\nits natural “at rest” position.\n8.  The tongue will be naturally soft at all times, but can touch the teeth\nwith different strengths.\n9.  The tongue will be in its “down position” 98% of the time when\narticulating correctly.\n  Have the student start their sound with the air.\n  Using the information about the basics of articulation, have the student articulate\nas fast as they can with no limitations of numbers, worries about evenness of\narticulation, etc.  Simply get them used to articulating!\n  Have the student then use the “ta-day” syllable to practice using the tongue in an\norganized manner.\n  Have the student then articulate “on command.”  The student will start their\nsound, and articulate when you snap your fingers to practice gaining more control\nof the tongue.\n  Once the student understands pulse and the foot pat, have the student articulate\nexactly when the toe of the foot touches the floor.\n  Have the student articulate with the down and up position of the foot.\n  Proceed to written rhythms as they begin to read music.\nAlways practice this entire routine.  The student must always go through the\nentire process, so he will not lose the ability to move his tongue at various speeds\nand in a structured manner.\nEUPHONIUM FLEXIBILITY AND\nRANGE EXTENSION\n  Brass playing is based upon flexibility.\n  There are two types of flexibility: flexibility within the instrument and flexibility\nwithin the note.\n  Students eventually need to be flexible through each of the harmonic series in\norder to move up and down within the range of the instrument.\n  Once the student can reproduce at will a given pitch, the teacher must decide\nwhether flexibility up or down is needed first.\n  Flexibility is controlled by air direction and the isometrics created by the corners\nand canine/eye teeth.  The head must always stay in its natural, balanced position\nat all times.  The angle of the instrument must not change at any time.\n  Students must learn to angle the air in the cup of the mouthpiece without changing\nthe position of the lips and/or the relationship of the upper and lower teeth.\n  Flexibility is also enhanced by vowel sounds used in various registers.  These\nsounds can be “ah” for the middle register….”ee” for the upper register….and\n“oh” for the lower register.  Have students practice saying these vowel sounds\nwith vocalization on appropriate lower, middle and higher sounds.\n  The speed of the air and the shape of the vowel guide flexibility.  The tongue\nassists the air speed similar to the way one’s thumb assists the water speed from a\nhose.  The tongue relaxes when descending into the lower register and arches\nwhen ascending into the upper register.\n  Bring to the students’ attention that the shape of the tongue changes dramatically\nfrom vowel sound to vowel sound.  All students should be aware that vowel\nsounds are the middles of words that they speak every day.  Practice saying words\nthat use the required vowel sounds (i.e.  bow, ball, beep).\n  Range is developed through flexibility.  It is more important to create a resonant\nsound while practicing flexibility than to create wider intervals.  The student can\nenhance their range by making more resonant sounds in the middle register before\ntrying to extend higher or lower.\n  While it is important to create resonant sounds in the register students can play in,\nit is important for students to occasionally try exploring both the upper and lower\nrange they struggle to make a good sound in.  This should be practiced perhaps\ntwice a week.\n  Make sure students understand the texture of the lips have nothing to do with\nrange. For example, students should never be told to “tighten” their lips in order\nto play in the higher register.\nEUPHONIUM COMPENSATING SYSTEM\n  Most commonly found on more advanced euphoniums; this system is not\ntypically used on beginner instruments.\n  The compensating system works like the F-attachment on trombone.  When 4th\nvalve is depressed, the instrument is pitched in the key of F.\n  The compensating system allows for the possibility to play a full chromatic scale\nbetween the 1st and 2nd partials (low B-flat – low E specifically)\n  With all valves depressed on a compensating euphonium (1-2-3-4), the instrument\nwill sound a low B-natural.  That same valve combination on a non-compensating\neuphonium will only produce a low C.  This makes the low B-natural a non-\nexistent note on a non-compensating horn.\n  When using a compensating-style instrument, you have the advantage of being\nable to play lower octaves using conventional fingerings and pressing down 4th\nvalve.  For example, 3rd line D-flat would be played 2-3.  To play the octave\nbelow, one would hold depress the 2-3-valve combination and add 4th valve.  This\nwould be a different fingering on a non-compensating euphonium (1-3-4)\n  Having a compensating euphonium is extremely beneficial in extending the lower\nrange chromatically.\n  1-3 and 1-2-3 valve combinations can be played 4 and 2-4, respectively, to help\nwith resonance, clarity, and tuning difficulties.\n  Most compensating euphoniums will have the 4th valve halfway down the right\nside of the instrument – this valve is to be played with the left index finger (not\nthe middle finger).\n  The 4th valve is placed down the side of the instrument because of the relative\nweakness of right hand pinky when playing a “4 valve on top” or “inline 4” style\ninstrument.\n  Not all 4 valve instruments are compensating— you must look behind the valves\nto see if the instrument includes extra tubing that goes through the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd\nvalves.\nEUPHONIUM GENERAL TUNING\nTENDENCIES\nThe Overtone Series\n  There are 7 possible combinations of fingerings:\n  Open\n  2\n  1\n  1-2 (3rd valve alone is about the same length)\n  2-3\n  1-3 (4)\n  1-2-3 (2-4)\n  Each valve combination plays a series of slotted notes. Displayed below are all\nthe possible notes that can be played without pressing any valves down (open).\n  The order of valve combinations listed above will lower every note on the staff by\na half-step.  The lowest note on the 2nd valve combination would be an A…the 1st\nvalve combination would be an Ab, etc.\n  Because each overtone series is in tune with itself, switching between all 7 will\ncause tuning tendencies.\n  To overcome a tuning tendency, the following can be done:\n1.  Valve slide adjustment\n2.  Vowel shape/air direction adjustment\n3.  Alternate fingering\n  Before going over which adjustment should be used when, it is important to go\nover the specific tuning tendencies.\nSharp Notes\n  Fairly sharp\n  Should be played 2-4\n  Usually a fairly sharp note\n  1st valve slide should be pulled\nout\n  Moderately sharp\n  Open vowel shape\n  Very sharp on most\neuphoniums\n  Main tuning slide\nshould be pulled out\n  Could use 3rd valve\nfor alternate\nfingering\nnote on some\n  Could use 2-3 for\nalternate fingering\n  Severely sharp on most\n  Should be played using 4th\nvalve\n  More open vowel shape\n  Slightly sharp\n  More open vowel\nshape\n  Could be played using 3rd valve\n  3rd valve slide should be pulled\nout slightly\n  Do not pull 2nd valve slide for\nthis note\n  Very sharp on most euphoniums\n  Main tuning slide must be\npulled out\n  Very flat\n  Should play using\n1st valve not open\n  Flat on most\n  Could use 1-2 as\n  Extremely flat\n  Can be played\nopen, 1st valve, or\n1-3\nFlat Notes\n  Moderately flat\n  Check to make sure the\nembouchure is not coming\napart\n  Slightly flat on most\n  Supported air stream\nand lip up\n  Slightly flat\n  Severely flat\n  Lip up/blow air up\n  Supported air\nstream\n  Could use 1-2 as an\nVowel Shape/Air Direction\n  Vowel shape/air direction is the most common adjustment that will be made with\nyounger students.\n  For the upper register:\n  Students who are above pitch or have a pinched/strident sound are most\nlikely closing their teeth. Remind students that even when making an “ee”\nvowel shape in the upper register, there should be space between the back\nteeth.\n  Students who are below pitch or have a weak/unsupported sound are most\nlikely not using fast enough air or their tongue is not arched enough (“ee”\nvowel shape).\n  For the lower register:\n  Students who are above pitch or have a pinched/thin sound are most likely\nnot playing with a big enough vowel shape. Ask students to drop their\njaws and blow warm, calm air through the space between their teeth.\n  Students who are below pitch or have a sagging/dull sound are most likely\nletting their corner collapse and/or not keeping their corners firm. Remind\nstudents that even a relaxed vowel shape and air stream are supported by\nthe same embouchure used to play a concert F.\n  The middle register is a good place for students to practice their flexibility within\na note. Create games and exercises for students to manipulate which direction\nthey blow their air (up/down) and the vowel shape they use to change the pitch of\na note (while maintaining a characteristic sound).\n  To bend a note up, blow the air higher into the mouthpiece and make the\nvowel shape smaller.\n  To bend a note down, blow the air lower into the mouthpiece and make\nthe vowel shape bigger.\n  Encourage students to perform the aforementioned adjustments on both\nthe mouthpiece alone and on the instrument.\nValve Slide Adjustment\n  Unlike the trumpet and tuba, students do not have the luxury of being able to\nadjust slides for tuning purposes while playing the euphonium.  All slides must be\nset before playing!\n  Tuning slides should be set to the following:\n  Main tuning slide pulled out to have concert F and above the staff Bb in\ntune (will vary from player to player, but most of the time will be\nanywhere from ½ inch to 1 inch).\n  First valve slide should be slightly pulled out.\n  Second valve slide does not need to be pulled out at all because of the\nshortness of slide length and minimal tuning deficiencies while using\nsecond valve.\n  Third valve slide can be pulled out to compensate for problematic sharp\nnotes.\n  4th valve should be pulled out to have low F and in the staff C in tune.\nAlternate Fingerings\n  Using the overtone series, one can find more options that are not specifically\nlisted.\n  3 for above the staff G\n  4 or 1-3 for above the staff F\n  3 for above the staff A\n  4 or 1-3 for 5th line A (if A is very flat)\n  That being said, a band director should only know these fingerings if all else fails.\nMost alternate fingerings, especially higher notes using more valves than\nrequired, will dull the sound and drastically change the pitch. There will be\noccasions where a student brings his/her own euphonium with very different\ntuning tendencies and needs an uncommon option.\n  When it comes to trills, alternate fingerings are completely acceptable. Students\nshould learn that an F#-G trill is easier and cleaner to execute using 3rd valve\ninstead of 1st and 2nd for the G.\n  At the high school level, it is more than acceptable to try fingerings that either\ndarken or brighten the tone for chord balance purposes.\nTROMBONE/EUPHONIUM WARM-UP SHEET #1\n1\n?\n4 w\n4\n? w\n2\n? wb\nwb\n3\nw\n∑\n? ˙\n˙b\n? ˙b\n? œ\nœ\nœb\n? œb\n5\n˙\nTROMBONE/EUPHONIUM WARM-UP SHEET #2\n4 œ œ œ œ\nœ œ œ\nœ œ œ œ\nœ œ\nœ#\nœ œ œ ˙\nœ œ œ œ œ\nœ ˙\nŒ\nœ œ#\nœ œb\nTROMBONE/EUPHONIUM CHROMATIC SCALE\n? 44\n? œ#\nTROMBONE/EUPHONIUM CHRISTMAS TUNES\nJingle Bells\n? 44 œ\nGood King Wenceslas\n4 œb\nÓ"

    "text": "FLUTE CASES, IDENTIFYING AND REMOVING PARTS, ASSEMBLY, MAINTENANCE AND INSTRUMENT/BODY RATIO\nGeneral Information About All Woodwind Instrument Cases\nMost cases have distinguishing marks somewhere on the case.  Identify these marks, and their relationship to the top and bottom of the case.  Most cases have the handles placed on the bottom section of each case.  Check to make sure.\nPlace all cases on the floor in front of the student, or on a large table in the correct position.  Flute cases are more easily opened from the top of a large table.\nBe sure the student understands where each part of the instrument belongs in the case.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make sure the student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure the parts of the instruments are returned to the case in the reverse order they were removed.\nAll instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure explicitly every time.\nNever leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up, but this is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.  Check each opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to your students.\nCases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom setup for each student’s case.\nIdentifying and Removing Parts Safely From Its Case\nOnce the case information is understood, place the case on a flat surface.  Never let the student place the case in his lap.\nOpen the case from its correct position.  Remember, most latches will lift up.\nStudents must be taught to keep one hand on some part of the flute at all times.\nWith the left hand, take the body out and lightly grasp the end with no keys (barrel).  Turn the body so the barrel is facing towards the left, and the G#/A-flat (“teardrop”) key is away from the student’s body.\nWith the right hand, take out the foot joint and hold without touching any keys.  Turn the foot joint so that the “roller” keys face the student’s body.\nPut the flute together with slight, twisting motions in an up-and-down fashion (as opposed to twisting from side-to-side).   Discourage students from using their knees as leverage while assembling the body and the foot joint.  If students have difficulty, have them wipe off grit from the edges with any of their cloths or their bandana.\nTo line up the flute, the rod of the foot joint must point to the center of the last circular key on the body.  This may need to be adjusted for the size of the student’s right hand.  (Yamaha flutes have an arrow on both the head joint and the body to help with aligning the flute; however, this is not the best way to line up the body and the foot joint.)\nHold the flute at the barrel with the left hand while gently resting it on the left knee (because the right foot should be the normal tapping foot).\nPick up the head joint with the right hand and attach to the barrel.  Grasp the longer end of the head joint.  Remove any moisture and/or grit off the exterior of the end of the open end of head joint.\nMake sure the head joint is properly aligned with the rest of the flute so that the center of the embouchure hole is aligned to the circular keys of the body.  After fully assembled, support the bottom of the flute with the left hand, close one eye, and look down the flute as you would when looking through a telescope.\nSEND SEGMENTS OF THIS INFORMATION HOME TO PARENTS.  CHOOSE THE INFORMATION YOU THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR HOME PRACTICE AND INSTRUMENT CARE.\nLook at the case in relation to the parts of the flute.  Most cases are molded to the shape of a particular part.  Be specific when making this point to your students.  Take your time, and repeat the information many times.  Notice that all circular keys are toward the ceiling when placed correctly in the case.  Damage will occur if the parts are placed incorrectly in the case.\nThe embouchure hole on the head joint must be facing the ceiling when placed correctly in the case.  The crown of the head joint must be facing the middle of the case.\nTake the instrument apart in the exact opposite manner keeping your hands on the pieces you are removing.\nInstrument Maintenance\nStudents should use their silk swab or one of their cloths or bandana to wipe moisture off the keys after use.  They should tie the bandana (if used) to the handle—or wrap it around the cleaning rod inside the case.  The latter will prevent the cleaning rod from scratching any part of the flute.   No unnecessary objects may be placed in the case at any time.  Only the parts of the flute should be allowed in the case.  Students should not be allowed to use a fuzzy swab which stays inside the flute when in the case.\nThe student should be given CLASS TIME to clean out his instrument, and store properly in the case.  A textured cloth is great to remove grease or fingerprints from the flute.  Students can also wipe both the tops and in between the keys with this cloth.\nStudents need to clean the dust and moisture out of their flutes by using either the cleaning rod, a small/thin paintbrush or a small soft bristle brush used to apply makeup.  Thread the cotton cloth through the eye of the cleaning rod.  Swab the body and foot joint from both ends.  Do not force the cloth through either part.\nIf you choose to teach your students to swab out the head joint, they must be careful and delicate when inserting the cleaning rod into the head joint.  Avoid\nany movement of the cork, as this affects intonation later on.  (See additional handout regarding adjusting the cork.)\nBE VERY SPECIFIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nInstrument/Body Ratio\nFamiliarize the student with the instrument/body ratio by using the entire assembled flute…and also without the head joint.\nMove the instrument up and down, side to side and front to back by using the elbows.  The body playing position also holds true from previous information.  We are merely getting used to the weight of the instrument; the position of the instrument; and the angle of the instrument without using correct hand position.  The student should not squeeze the instrument as these exercises are practiced.  Keep the palms of the hands soft.\nThe three balance points of the head joint only are the chin, the right and left hand thumb and two fingers used to properly hold the headjoint.\nThe three balance points of the fully-assembled flute are the chin, the left hand index finger (whose knuckle provides stability on the outside of the instrument) and the right hand thumb (which lifts and supports the flute).\nFamiliarize the student in this manner for a few days before placing the fingers in their correct position.\nStorage of Head Joint (when allowed to be taken home by the students but not in the actual flute case)\nHave students bring a sock with some sort of indentifying feature or use an actual head joint bag (either sold to students or hand-made by a seamstress).\nSocks should be kept in a box in the front of the classroom.\nSocks should only be taken out of the classroom by students after school.\nSocks should only be brought into the classroom prior to the start of school.\nHead joints should never be kept in backpacks, bookbags, pencil pouches, etc.\nHave some sort of accountability system in place when students leave their socks (head joints) overnight.\nBe on the lookout for students coming into your classroom with socks (and later flute cases) which were kept in their lockers or gym lockers."

    "text": "FLUTE FLEXIBILITY\n•  The embouchure must be flexible so your students can change registers easily,\nplay with a consistent sound from top to bottom, and play with correct intonation\nin the upper register.\n•  Aperture shapes:\nWhen playing in the low register, the aperture is oval or cigar shaped.\nWhen playing in the middle register, the aperture is oval or cigar shaped but\nsmaller.\nWhen playing in the upper register, the aperture shape is smaller and round.\n•  Changing registers:  The jaw and corners literally come forward.  The aperture\nshape will resemble the shape when whistling.  Use more top lip when playing in\nthe lower register to aim the air down.  When starting in the lower register, the air\nspeed should be very fast and should move forward.  In general, the air should\ncome more forward the higher the student plays.\n•  Utilize the syllables “eee/eih”…… “ewww” when moving from the low sound to\nthe high sound.\n•  Practice flexibility going from low to high before going high to low.\nFlexibility Exercises\n•  Using just the headjoint, have students cover the open end with their right hand.\nPlay the low sound…then slide to the high sound.\n•  Play the low sound……the high sound……the low sound.\n•  These same kinds of exercise can be done with the open end of the headjoint\nuncovered.\n•  Add the metronome to this activity when students have met your expectations.\n•\nWhen playing the octave at the end of each measure, students will need to use a\nlot of focused air because the change happens quickly.  This is especially true in\nthe last measure of the exercise.  The descending notes must move quickly so the\nstudents will have enough air in reserve to execute the octave in each capsule.\n•  As students progress, another octave can be added to the end of each capsule.\n•  Octave Slurs—refer to Set 1/Octave Slurs\n•  Advanced students can use the harmonics in Set 6 to develop more flexibility and\nstrength.  Harmonics should be taught in very small groups and/or private\nlessons….never in a large class setting.  Embouchures can easily become tight if\ncareful monitoring is not observed.\nCreating a Resonant Upper Register\n•  The corners and jaw come forward.\n•  The bottom lip may turn out or come forward in order to blow more across the\nembouchure hole.\n•  There should be more air behind the lips.  The cheeks inflate more and more as\nyou ascend.\n•  The teeth need to stay apart, because they tend to close.\n•  Let the jaw be open—do not force it.\n•  The tongue should stay forward and soft.  It must not arch.  If young students tend\nto play above center, their tongue may be pulled back into their throat or their\nembouchure may be too tight.  These problems will result in students playing with\nshrill and harsh sounds.\n•  The corners of the mouth and lips should remain soft.\nCreating a Resonant Lower Register\n•  Blow air across to the outer edge of the lip plate.\n•  Students should never be allowed to pull their corners back into a smile.  The lips\nshould never be stretched against the canine/vampire teeth.\n•  The lower register will be very difficult to produce if the headjoint is placed too\nhigh on the lower lip.\n•  Shape with the top lip to project a more focused and resonant sound."

    "text": "MAKING THE FIRST FLUTE HEADJOINT SOUND\n•\nInitial sound production cannot be introduced until correct posture and breathing\nhas been successfully taught.  Include these two essential components as “part” of\nthe first sound attempt(s).\n•  Relax position and ready position should already be taught and drilled prior to\nsound production.  As sound production is occurring, playing position must be\nincorporated.  Students need to understand that ready position means they are\nready to receive information and play.  Playing position means that they are\nphysically set to play.  Students should not be allowed to sit in relax position\nduring class, except maybe during announcements, paperwork or things not\npertaining to playing.  If one word instructions are preferred, then use “ready”\nand “set.”\n•  Try to get every student to make a sound on the first day of sound production.  If\nyou will not be able to accomplish this, make a disclaimer before you start.  The\nstudents who do not end up getting to make their first sound—on the first day—\nwill be the first students you will start with on the second day!  Students should\nnot be surprised or frustrated if you do not get to them on this first day.\n•  On day one of sound production, make another disclaimer if you suspect that you\nwill not get far enough along to allow any of the students to take home their “set-\nup.”\n•  At the end of each class, you must make the decision to allow just those who you\nassisted to take home their set-up…….or not allow set-ups to go home until\neveryone has made sounds with your assistance (day one, day two, etc.).\n•  Once you allow and require set-ups to go home on a daily basis, students should\nbe recording their practice time on whatever form of practice card you are using.\nBe realistic when designating ____ minutes to be spent on their set-up sounds\nduring their home practice.\n•  Do not use a metronome when assisting students to make their first sounds.  A\nmetronome should not be added until the class is at the point of making group\nsounds.\n•  Remind students that lipstick, Chapstick, etc. cannot be worn during class.\nStudents need to understand that their lip plates will not last long, and they will\nbegin to see erosion, rust.  (cid:1)\n•  When working one-on-one with students in your beginning class, it is important\nthat the students are ready as soon as the teacher reaches them.  While other\nstudents are waiting, they must either be paying attention to what you are\ndoing…..or working on a music theory worksheet, etc.\n•  While going around the room, students should not be allowed to make sounds on\ntheir set-up—even if they have already been assisted.  They should also not be\nallowed to improperly hold their set-up (i.e. putting a finger in the bottom of their\nheadjoint…..twirling or playing with the set-up in general……etc.)\n•  The instructor must place all headjoints for students.  This may continue for\n2-5 days (if not longer), depending on the size and overall ability level of your\nclass.\n•  You should be directly in front of each individual student when assisting them,\nand not to the side. It would be most effective if students were standing and\n“finding their horizon.”  Music stands should be elevated to the proper height,\nand a mirror should be properly positioned on each stand.  You will learn to\nmaneuver around each student’s equipment, etc.  At this point, all cases should be\ndirectly under or to the side of their chairs.\n•  As you are working with each student, your goal is to assist each student in\nmaking a quality sound on or in the vicinity of the correct pitch (second space A\nflat or A).  Do not get on to students who do not produce the exact pitch—\nespecially if they are using brands flutes that may be inferior and/or not on your\nrecommended list.  When listening to each student, listen for:\no  quality of sound\no  consistency of sound\no  pitch\n•  Unless the flute is your primary instrument, you should not be modeling sounds\non the set-up.  As you assist each student, you will eventually find a “star student”\nwho will become the model for future reference.  Be sure to periodically use a\nkeyboard or a metronome—with pitches—so as not to “lose sight” of the correct\npitch (regardless of whether or not a model is used).\n•  Be aware of fragile and/or teary-eyed students. Move on to the next student in the\ninterest of time, but make an effort to return to these students by the end of class.\nDo not let a student leave class feeling unsuccessful.  If possible, offer a pass for\nstruggling students to come in at lunch or before/after school.\n•  The set-up always goes to the student; not the student to the set-up.\n•  Before bringing the set-up to the student, check for:\no  proper alignment of the cork in the headjoint\n•  Train students not to move their faces or body when you are placing the set-up. It\nmay take certain students multiple tries, and if they move after each attempt, they\n(and you!) basically have to start over each time.\n•  When students breathe, do not allow their corners to pull back at all.\nFurthermore, upper lips should not be pulling up, or back, but instead\npointed/pulled down. If you feel comfortable doing so, you may need to assist the\nstudent by touching the area between the bottom of the nose and the upper lip and\nhelp them. If you are uncomfortable, assist them with words and demonstration.\nStudents can breathe through their mouth, but if this causes them to pull back\ntheir corners, ask them to keep their face still and breathe in through the nose.\n•  With the set-up, students should think the following:\no  No articulation, use “pooh”…..not “hooh”\n•  No articulation syllable should be used when making set-up sounds.  The ultimate\ngoal is for students to start their sounds with air.  An articulation syllable will be\nassigned after all students are making characteristic and consistent sounds on the\nset-up, as well as the fully-assembled flute.\n•  Students need to direct their air down into the embouchure hole (think blowing\ninto a bottle) in order to achieve the desired sound.\n•  Make sure the students understand that “a sound” may not happen the very first\ntime. This is a trial and error process and may take multiple tries.\n•  Once the set-up has been placed correctly and students are making the sound you\nwant, they need to remember:\no  how it looks (by looking in the mirror)\no  how it feels\nAllow and instruct them to take the set-up from your hand without moving their\nbody and embouchure.  Have them try to reproduce the sound on their own.  Be\nprepared to further assist them if necessary.  When the sound is correct, students\nneed to remember how it sounds.\n•  Train students to freeze their body, face and embouchure at the end of whatever\ntype of sound is being made (whether it is air, a tone, etc.)  The student should not\nmove anything until the director calls the students to ready position.  This aspect\nof playing should transfer to any—and everything students play in the future (i.e.\nafter last notes of lines out of the book, last notes of songs, etc.)\n•  Whether students are making individual or group sounds, they need to stop when\nthey feel like they are running out of air.  It should never be thought of as a\ncontest to see who can hold their sounds the longest.  That serves absolutely no\nbenefit.\nIf a student feels dizzy or faint, allow them to bend over in their chair for a little\nwhile until they feel better.\nIf you hear fuzziness or airy sounds in the tone, the student’s aperture is likely too\nwide/big and the air is being aimed too far across.  This is usually caused by\nstudents pulling their corners back, wrong directions of air, top lip is not down\nenough, or a wide aperture.  Students need to constantly be told to bring their top\nlip down.  After a student has been made aware that they are making a fuzzy or\nairy tone, the expectation should be stated for the student to return to class the\nnext day without that issue.\n•  Extraneous noises at ends of sounds are a result of students collapsing their\nembouchures and/or postures.  Have students sing “la” or “dah”; then, apply that\nto the end of their sound.\nIt is your job, as the teacher, to diagnose any problems through this trial and error\nprocess.  As you go around the room, it may be helpful to you to take written\nnotes on students having problems.  Jot down any catchphrases, analogies or\nspecific things that you said to them that helped them in any way!\nIf you are struggling in your efforts to assist multiple students…..or are unsure\nabout what you are doing in general, then hire an outside consultant or\nexperienced private lesson teacher to come to your class and help.  As this\nprofessional goes around the room to hear your students, you need to follow\nthem……watch exactly what they are doing…..and take notes as well.  No\nmatter the scenario, reference these notes as you see fit in future classes.\n•  After _____ days, students will eventually need to be able to place their set-up\nand make a sound without your assistance.  The amount of time will vary year to\nyear, taking into consideration the size of the class, the overall quality of their\nsounds, and how many times you have assisted the students.\n•  8th Grade Only: Piccolo students should be relying on either their private lesson\nteacher or 1 on 1 sessions with a director outside of the section/ensemble\nrehearsals if they are having problems creating the proper characteristic sound.\n•  Students need to constantly be reminded that characteristic and consistent\nset-up sounds are stepping stones to making sounds on the fully-assembled\nflute!  Students who do not practice their set-up sounds at home are not only\nslowing the class down, but are not contributing to the daily progress and\nquality of the class.\n**Much of this information is applicable to beginner interviews."

This will help students to\naim their air down into the embouchure hole better for certain notes.\n(cid:1)  Medium, but full lips are preferable—especially the lower lip.\n(cid:1)  A very thin top lip makes it very challenging for students to play with a correct\nsound.\n(cid:1)  Hands and fingers need to be large enough to cover the holes when there are no plugs\nin the keys.\n(cid:1)  Avoid putting students on flute who have a teardrops or “Betty Boop” lips.  A tear\ndrop occurs when the lips come together at a point, resulting in air that splits.\nStudents with teardrops should be steered towards another instrument.\n(cid:1)  There are many outstanding flute players that play to the side, but unless you are\nexperienced at teaching this type of flute embouchure, you should avoid placing\nstudents on flute if they have an extreme teardrop or “crooked embouchure” and must\nplay to the side.  It is very time consuming, and could be very frustrating at first for\nthe student and teacher.  Many times, it can take days…..or even weeks…….to\nproduce acceptable first flute sounds.\n(cid:1)  Avoid placing students on flute who have an extreme overbite or underbite.\n(cid:1)\nIf a student has a protruding tooth, have them close their lips and push where the\nheadjoint will end up being placed.  If that “sensation” is painful to the student, then\nthey should be steered towards an instrument that goes into their mouth.\n(cid:1)  The jaw must be flexible.\n(cid:1)  Students with braces will most likely struggle in general, especially if they start in\nbeginning class without braces.  Encourage parents to inquire with their child’s\ndentist regarding the possibility of using Invisalign.\nNon-Physical Characteristics/Factors\n(cid:1)  There should be no gender bias when selecting flute players; however, you must\nconsider the school climate/demographics when choosing a boy to play the flute.\nKeep in mind that some of the most famous flautists in the world are male (i.e. Sir\nJames Galway, Jean-Pierre Rampal, Julius Baker, etc.)  Therefore, if a boy expresses\ngenuine interest in playing the flute, then move forward from that point.\n(cid:1)  Be prepared to do whatever you have to in order to convince parents—especially\nfathers—that boys can play flute. You may need to do this without the student there;\nstudents should not be present during a discussion that may be getting uncomfortable.\nIf you have boy flute players in your top ensemble, it is an excellent idea to have\nthem demonstrate the flute at your recruiting concert(s)….regardless of their chair.\nCHOOSING PICCOLO PLAYERS AND AUDITIONS\nFactors Involved for Selecting Piccolo Players\n•  One piccolo player can be used in a middle school program--ONLY in the top band.\nHaving a piccolo should not detract from the ensemble; you can always rewrite the\npart for the first flute player.  There are a few exceptions when two piccolo players\nare necessary for a particular piece of music (Marche Des Parachutistes Belges by\nPierre Leemans).\n•  Do not showcase the piccolo at a recruiting concert unless you explain that only one\nflute player in your entire program gets to play it (and usually that player is an eighth\ngrader).\n•  Do not even mention or talk about using a piccolo in your band unless you think you\nhave a student physically capable of playing it…..and are planning to program a piece\nof music in which utilizing a piccolo will be necessary.\n•  Do not sacrifice your flute section by having the top player play piccolo.  The student\nplaying piccolo must sound good, because once a piccolo is added to an ensemble\nsound, it is hard to hide.  ☺  You must also have “remaining” top flute players in your\nsection that also sound good and can handle the first part.\n•  Choose a student with a naturally small aperture and with thin lips.  Students having\nfuller lips will have difficulty with flexibility and focusing their sound.\nAuditions for Piccolo\n•  Wait a month or two after school starts before you even start mentioning the\npossibility of utilizing a piccolo in your ensemble.\n•  If at all possible, allow an 8th grader to play the piccolo over a 7th grader.\n•  Do not encourage or allow any flute player to have their parents go out and buy a\npiccolo.  This is extremely presumptuous, unfair to other students and in general\ninappropriate.  Do not allow yourself to be “strong-armed” into anything regarding\nthe selection of a piccolo player.\n•  In most cases a school-owned piccolo will be used.  With that said, make sure that it\nis good playing condition and have someone you trust test its playing condition.\nWooden piccolos are preferable to plastic and metal piccolos for inside playing.\nPlastic piccolos are preferable to metal piccolos for marching band purposes.\n•  Find out how many students are interested in trying out for the piccolo.\n•  Consult with your private lesson teacher or colleague regarding what the audition\nshould consist of.\n•  Give the piccolo to each student for one school night each so that they have equal\ntime to play on it and practice.  It is not fair to give a student the piccolo over the\nweekend.\n•  Have auditions the day after the last week night that a student had the piccolo at\nhome.\n•  Hire someone from the outside to hear the audition.  Try to select a band director or\nprivate lesson flautist; even if someone on your staff is a flautist.  This way,\ndisgruntled parents will not be able to say that the auditions were in anyway unfair.\n•  Once the student is officially selected, do not encourage he/she to buy their own\npiccolo because there is no guarantee that they will play it as a 9th or 10th grader in\nhigh school.  Now in knowing that there is no guarantee that they will be allowed or\nhave the opportunity to play piccolo in high school, the student’s parents may still\nwant to purchase a piccolo!  This can only be a good thing, because the newly-\npurchased piccolo may be in better condition than your school-owned piccolo(s)!\n•  If the official student is really good and is probable to succeed, allow them to play\npiccolo at your Winter Concert (or right after the winter break).\nWarm-ups\n•  Your piccolo player should warm-up half the time on their flute and half the time on\nthe piccolo.  This is so the student does not “lose” their flute chops…….and because\nthey may not end up playing the piccolo on all music being performed in the\nensemble at any given performance during the school year.\n•  Your piccolo player must use a doubler stand—whether they are able to purchase one\nor you acquire one through your budget.  You should never allow a piccolo to be\n“housed” on the music stand when not in use.  (cid:2)\n•  Avoid having your piccolo player go back and forth between flute and piccolo in your\nprogrammed music. Going back and forth between a multi-movement piece is ok, but\nnot within movements.\n•  When utilizing a piccolo in your ensemble, be smart about what to play.\n•  Encourage and allow your piccolo player to use a violin clip-on tuner.  With that said,\nthe piccolo player should not be required to look at the director during warm-up\nexercises that are to be memorized by all other members of the ensemble.\n•  When looking at the tuner, do not allow the piccolo player to look down.  This will\nresult in he/she looking down and thus rolling in and covering too much of the\nembouchure hole.  (cid:2)  The music stand needs to be at the appropriate height.\n.\nTendencies\n•  When a student transfers from flute to piccolo, monitor carefully as they will tend to\nroll in and cover too much of the embouchure hole.\nIn general, students playing piccolo will tend to play more “pinched” because the\naperture tends to be smaller.\n•  After a student begins playing the piccolo, almost everything will be flat.  Until the\nstudent gets “used to it” after several weeks (if not longer), be patient with their\nintonation.\n•  With more experienced players, the pitch tendency on piccolo is to play sharp.\nRegion-Band (Middle and High School)\n•  Do not just “throw” someone on piccolo just to get another student into region-band.\n•  Do not force students into a bad audition situation just because they play piccolo.\nThis experience may result in long-term negative effects for the student.\n•  You may want to suggest that your piccolo player bring ear plugs into the audition\nroom(s).\nBEGINNING FLUTE CLASSROOM AND\nENSEMBLE SET-UP\nBeginning Classroom Set-Up\n•  Your beginning flute class will most likely be the biggest beginner class and should\ntherefore be taught in the band hall!! Smaller ensemble rooms need to be reserved for the\nsaxophone, double reed, French horn and percussion classes.\n•  Configure your classroom based on how many students you have in the class.\n•  Start off the semester by putting students in alphabetical order so you can learn their\nnames faster.  Once music stands and mirrors are utilized in class, hanging name tags can\ncontinue to help you learn student names quicker. These can and should also be used on\nany days you have clinicians/consultants visit.\nTypes of Classroom Set-Ups\n1.  Arched set-up\nIf using your “ensemble set-up” for your class, have students sit in a “box,” so all\nstudents receive the same amount of attention/eye contact from you.\n(cid:1)  Have students sit in every other chair (if all chairs have to remain in your set-up\nthroughout the day).\n(cid:1)  The aisles between your rows must be large enough so that you will have quick and\neasy access to any student--both from the front and the back.\nIf you end up needing to use risers, make sure the backings are on them for safety\nreasons. If the risers do not come with backings, you can enlist the help of either a\nband dad or your woodshop teacher to install backings.\n(cid:1)  As much as possible, have students in “windows.”\n(cid:1)  You must be able to see each student from the front and the back.  With that said, you\nare not always able to correct student’s posture, hand position, etc. from the front of\nthe room; thus, you need to be walking around the room instead of “parking” on a\nstool!\n(cid:1)  Once you start determining playing ability levels of your students, place weaker\nplayers in the front of the classroom and stronger players in the back. Less attention is\ntypically given to players who are further back in the set-up.\n2.  Horseshoe set-up\n(cid:1)  This set-up is not recommended--why? Because you have a limited range of vision.\nIf you decide to use this set-up, you will need to pull the stand/podium far enough\nback in order to have clear vision of every student.\n3.  Arched with aisle\n(cid:1)  This is a very acceptable set-up, even with full ensembles.\n4.  Straight line set-up\n(cid:1)  These should only be used with bigger facilities.\nIn order for you to have visual contact with all of the students, the students on the\nends of the rows will have to adjust their chairs/ bodies towards you or you need to\nhave them sitting in a “box” (see arched set-up).\n5.  Straight line set-up with aisle\nAISLE\n6.  Circular set up\n(cid:1)  One teacher teaches from the inside and one from the periphery. Students face in\ntowards middle.\nIf you are teaching alone, it will be too hard to maneuver when teaching outside of\nthe circle.\n(cid:1)  This set-up is typical in elementary school cafeterias or small stage “cafetoriums”.\n7.  Have beginners only sit on left of your band set-up.\n(cid:1)  Flute players need to be on the same side of the ensemble as the French horn players\nbecause they are considered color instruments.\n(cid:1)  This is advantageous because they will be already sitting in the exact way they will sit\nin an ensemble for the next couple years – and in chairs that should already be spaced\nout\nFull Ensemble Set-Up\n(cid:1)  Again, flute players need to be on the same side of the ensemble as the French horn\nplayers because they are considered color instruments.\n(cid:1)  First chairs need to sit together so they can more easily balance and match in terms of\nbalance, pitch, etc. Remember, the flute sound does not come out of the foot\njoint……rather the tone holes.\n(cid:1)  Piccolo players need to be either on the 1st or 2nd rows—never on the 3rd row.\n(cid:1)  During the first few weeks (if not more) of each school year, it would be a great idea\nto sit 7th and 8th graders (or 2nd and 3rd year players) alternately so the younger/weaker\nplayers are surrounded—on both sides—by 8th grade/stronger/more experienced\nplayers.\n(cid:1)  Additionally, you will find that your younger/less experienced players will start to\nhear vibrato being used by an 8th grader (or 3rd year player) on one or both sides of\nthem, and will start to learn vibrato through “osmosis.”\nRECOMMENDED FLUTE\nBRANDS/MODELS\nBeginner Flutes\nYamaha\nY 285 (old model number….has since been re-numbered to the YFL-281)\nYFL-281\nnickel/silver headjoint;

If the line is not centered in the\nembouchure hole, you will need to adjust the cork in or out.\n•  The closed end of the head joint is only a tightening mechanism.\n•  Do not grab the headjoint by the lip plate, because it can easily dent.\n•  On some attic horns, the lip plate can become unsoldered and will need to be\nprofessionally repaired.\n•  When holding the headjoint vertically, if the line is above the exact center of the\nembouchure hole, then unscrew the crown and push it back in.  When moving the\ncork down, it is more efficient to use one larger adjustment, rather than several\nsmaller adjustments.  Be careful not to overestimate how far down the cork needs\nto be moved in.\n•  When holding the headjoint vertically, if the line is below the exact center of the\nembouchure hole, then turn the crown clockwise (as if screwing in a screw).\nMake sure the tip of the cleaning rod is in contact with the bottom/metal part of\nthe cork; this is more easily done with the tuning/cleaning rod resting on a flat\nsurface or student’s knee.  Tighten the crown until the line is in the center of the\nembouchure hole.  If the line it too far to the left of center (resulting in the\ninstrument playing below center), tighten the screw.  If the line is too far right of\ncenter (resulting in the instrument playing above center), loosen the screw.\nIf you are unable to adjust the cork by using the crown, send the headjoint to the\nrepair shop.\n•  Students should never be allowed push the cork in with their tuning/cleaning rod\n(exception being advanced students).\n•  Do not allow students to aimlessly twist the cap during class! They will do this\nand not realize what they are doing!\nFLUTE CASES, IDENTIFYING AND REMOVING\nPARTS, ASSEMBLY, MAINTENANCE AND\nINSTRUMENT/BODY RATIO\nGeneral Information About All Woodwind Instrument Cases\n•  Most cases have distinguishing marks somewhere on the case.  Identify these\nmarks, and their relationship to the top and bottom of the case.  Most cases have\nthe handles placed on the bottom section of each case.  Check to make sure.\n•  Place all cases on the floor in front of the student, or on a large table in the correct\nposition.  Flute cases are more easily opened from the top of a large table.\n•  Be sure the student understands where each part of the instrument belongs in the\ncase.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make sure\nthe student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure the\nparts of the instruments are returned to the case in the reverse order they were\n•  All instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure\nexplicitly every time.\n•  Never leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up, but\nthis is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.  Check\neach opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to your\nstudents.\n•  Cases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom\nsetup for each student’s case.\nIdentifying and Removing Parts Safely From Its Case\n•  Once the case information is understood, place the case on a flat surface.  Never\nlet the student place the case in his lap.\n•  Open the case from its correct position.  Remember, most latches will lift up.\n•  Students must be taught to keep one hand on some part of the flute at all times.\n•  With the left hand, take the body out and lightly grasp the end with no keys\n(barrel).  Turn the body so the barrel is facing towards the left, and the G#/A-flat\n(“teardrop”) key is away from the student’s body.\n•  With the right hand, take out the foot joint and hold without touching any keys.\nTurn the foot joint so that the “roller” keys face the student’s body.\n•  Put the flute together with slight, twisting motions in an up-and-down fashion (as\nopposed to twisting from side-to-side).   Discourage students from using their\nknees as leverage while assembling the body and the foot joint.  If students have\ndifficulty, have them wipe off grit from the edges with any of their cloths or their\nbandana.\n•  To line up the flute, the rod of the foot joint must point to the center of the last\ncircular key on the body.  This may need to be adjusted for the size of the\nstudent’s right hand.  (Yamaha flutes have an arrow on both the head joint and the\nbody to help with aligning the flute; however, this is not the best way to line up\nthe body and the foot joint.)\n•  Hold the flute at the barrel with the left hand while gently resting it on the left\nknee (because the right foot should be the normal tapping foot).\n•  Pick up the head joint with the right hand and attach to the barrel.  Grasp the\nlonger end of the head joint.  Remove any moisture and/or grit off the exterior of\nthe end of the open end of head joint.\n•  Make sure the head joint is properly aligned with the rest of the flute so that the\ncenter of the embouchure hole is aligned to the circular keys of the body.  After\nfully assembled, support the bottom of the flute with the left hand, close one eye,\nand look down the flute as you would when looking through a telescope.\n•  SEND SEGMENTS OF THIS INFORMATION HOME TO PARENTS.\nCHOOSE THE INFORMATION YOU THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL\nFOR HOME PRACTICE AND INSTRUMENT CARE.\n•  Look at the case in relation to the parts of the flute.  Most cases are molded to the\nshape of a particular part.  Be specific when making this point to your students.\nTake your time, and repeat the information many times.  Notice that all circular\nkeys are toward the ceiling when placed correctly in the case.  Damage will occur\nif the parts are placed incorrectly in the case.\n•  The embouchure hole on the head joint must be facing the ceiling when placed\ncorrectly in the case.  The crown of the head joint must be facing the middle of\nthe case.\n•  Take the instrument apart in the exact opposite manner keeping your hands on the\npieces you are removing.\nInstrument Maintenance\n•  Students should use their silk swab or one of their cloths or bandana to wipe\nmoisture off the keys after use.  They should tie the bandana (if used) to the\nhandle—or wrap it around the cleaning rod inside the case.  The latter will\nprevent the cleaning rod from scratching any part of the flute.   No unnecessary\nobjects may be placed in the case at any time.  Only the parts of the flute should\nbe allowed in the case.  Students should not be allowed to use a fuzzy swab which\nstays inside the flute when in the case.\n•  The student should be given CLASS TIME to clean out his instrument, and store\nproperly in the case.  A textured cloth is great to remove grease or fingerprints\nfrom the flute.  Students can also wipe both the tops and in between the keys with\nthis cloth.\n•  Students need to clean the dust and moisture out of their flutes by using either the\ncleaning rod, a small/thin paintbrush or a small soft bristle brush used to apply\nmakeup.  Thread the cotton cloth through the eye of the cleaning rod.  Swab the\nbody and foot joint from both ends.  Do not force the cloth through either part.\nIf you choose to teach your students to swab out the head joint, they must be\ncareful and delicate when inserting the cleaning rod into the head joint.  Avoid\nany movement of the cork, as this affects intonation later on.  (See additional\nhandout regarding adjusting the cork.)\n•  BE VERY SPECIFIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nInstrument/Body Ratio\n•  Familiarize the student with the instrument/body ratio by using the entire\nassembled flute…and also without the head joint.\n•  Move the instrument up and down, side to side and front to back by using the\nelbows.  The body playing position also holds true from previous information.\nWe are merely getting used to the weight of the instrument; the position of the\ninstrument; and the angle of the instrument without using correct hand position.\nThe student should not squeeze the instrument as these exercises are practiced.\nKeep the palms of the hands soft.\n•  The three balance points of the head joint only are the chin, the right and left hand\nthumb and two fingers used to properly hold the headjoint.\n•  The three balance points of the fully-assembled flute are the chin, the left hand\nindex finger (whose knuckle provides stability on the outside of the instrument)\nand the right hand thumb (which lifts and supports the flute).\n•  Familiarize the student in this manner for a few days before placing the fingers in\ntheir correct position.\nStorage of Head Joint (when allowed to be taken home by the students but not in the\nactual flute case)\n•  Have students bring a sock with some sort of indentifying feature or use an actual\nhead joint bag (either sold to students or hand-made by a seamstress).\n•  Socks should be kept in a box in the front of the classroom.\n•  Socks should only be taken out of the classroom by students after school.\n•  Socks should only be brought into the classroom prior to the start of school.\n•  Head joints should never be kept in backpacks, bookbags, pencil pouches, etc.\n•  Have some sort of accountability system in place when students leave their socks\n(head joints) overnight.  (cid:1)\n•  Be on the lookout for students coming into your classroom with socks (and later\nflute cases) which were kept in their lockers or gym lockers.

Whether\ndone in class or individually, the teacher should be able to see the student’s face\nduring this procedure.  It is assumed that students are exhibiting correct “playing\nposture” at all times.  If this procedure is done in class, the teacher must place\neach student’s headjoint for several days.\n•  Once the teacher has guided the student for as long as necessary, he may begin to\nplace the headjoint on his own.  The following steps will take place with careful\nmonitoring from the teacher:\n1.  Students should pick up the headjoint with their fingertips, which are facing each\nother on the crown and at the other end of the headjoint--but not covering the\nopening.  If the fingertips are facing the student, he may tend to roll in or press.\n2.  The headjoint should rest on the “ledge” or “crook” of the chin.\nThere should be no pressure on the jaw.  The headjoint should not be jammed\nagainst the face.\n3.  The students will always direct their air toward the center of the embouchure hole.\n4.  With the headjoint on the ledge or crook of the chin, the edge of the embouchure\nhole will touch where the red and fleshy part of the skin meet.\n5.  The center of the aperture should line up with the center of the embouchure hole.\n6.  The lower lip should cover 1/4-1/3 of the embouchure hole.\n7.  The lower lip should be very “pouty.”  There should be as much lower lip on\nthe lip plate as possible.\nThe flute should line up four ways:\n1.  Left to right\n~The center of aperture should line up with the center of the embouchure hole.  If\nit is off center, move the headjoint to the position of the student’s aperture.  When the\nflute is in its correct playing position, a “pie wedge” is created between the body and\nthe instrument.  This will be demonstrated.\n2.  Front to back\n~The headjoint should not be crooked.  It should be parallel to the lips, but not\nparallel to the body.  There needs to be enough contact so the headjoint will not\n“bounce around.”\n3.  Up and down\n~The headjoint should not slant up and down.  Always center the embouchure\nhole to the aperture.  If the aperture is off center, then move the headjoint to the\ncenter of the student’s aperture.\n4.  In and out\n~As stated above, the lower lip should cover 1/4-1/3 of the embouchure hole.\n•  The outside of the lip plate has to be touched by air to get a great sound.\n(cid:1)  This means there is more air going into the flute -- when it splits,\nstudents will get their most centered, focused and resonant sound\n•  After headjoint is placed and lined up, then students blow\n(cid:1)  1  2  Breathe  |  Sound\n(3   4)\n(cid:1)  air  2  3  4  |  stop  2  breathe\n(3  4)\n(cid:2)\nremind students often to bring the corners forward -- just like\ndrinking water out of a water fountain!\nFirst Sound\n1.  With a natural face, have the student say the word “pooh.”  Look and see where\ntheir lips open naturally, as well as where the lips come apart first.  The tongue\nmust be down under the lower lip, because the tongue is not being used at this\npoint.\n2.  Blow a kiss and freeze it -- no pucker -- a soft kiss.  Students should feel how\ntheir lips move away from their teeth during this process.  The corners should\nalways close in from the sides.\n3.  The aperture is the opening between the lips.  Some apertures will be slightly off\ncenter.  More control can be achieved if the opening is directly in the center of the\nmouth.\n4.  Start with lips touching, and then blow a hole in the center with a “p” sound.  The\nlower lip cannot be behind the upper lip; if it is, then the air will point down.\n5.  Have students think “pooh”--and “p”--as the air moves past their lips.  There\nshould be no vocal sound produced.\n6.  In reality, sound is produced on the flute headjoint as the air moves in relation to\nthe embouchure hole.\n7.  Correct placement will result in a vapor trail (condensation in a V-shape) being\nvisible on the lip plate.  Students producing sounds without vapor trails are\nplaying either too tight and/or not having enough space between their teeth.\n•  Discourage the “kiss and roll” technique (kissing the center of the embouchure\nhole and then rolling out), as this allows too many variables regarding correct\nheadjoint placement.\n•  Discourage students from rolling in their headjoints too far in general.\nMAKING THE FIRST FLUTE HEADJOINT SOUND\nInitial sound production cannot be introduced until correct posture and breathing\nhas been successfully taught.  Include these two essential components as “part” of\nthe first sound attempt(s).\n•  Relax position and ready position should already be taught and drilled prior to\nsound production.  As sound production is occurring, playing position must be\nincorporated.  Students need to understand that ready position means they are\nready to receive information and play.  Playing position means that they are\nphysically set to play.  Students should not be allowed to sit in relax position\nduring class, except maybe during announcements, paperwork or things not\npertaining to playing.  If one word instructions are preferred, then use “ready”\nand “set.”\n•  Try to get every student to make a sound on the first day of sound production.  If\nyou will not be able to accomplish this, make a disclaimer before you start.  The\nstudents who do not end up getting to make their first sound—on the first day—\nwill be the first students you will start with on the second day!  Students should\nnot be surprised or frustrated if you do not get to them on this first day.\n•  On day one of sound production, make another disclaimer if you suspect that you\nwill not get far enough along to allow any of the students to take home their “set-\nup.”\n•  At the end of each class, you must make the decision to allow just those who you\nassisted to take home their set-up…….or not allow set-ups to go home until\neveryone has made sounds with your assistance (day one, day two, etc.).\n•  Once you allow and require set-ups to go home on a daily basis, students should\nbe recording their practice time on whatever form of practice card you are using.\nBe realistic when designating ____ minutes to be spent on their set-up sounds\nduring their home practice.\n•  Do not use a metronome when assisting students to make their first sounds.  A\nmetronome should not be added until the class is at the point of making group\nsounds.\n•  Remind students that lipstick, Chapstick, etc. cannot be worn during class.\nStudents need to understand that their lip plates will not last long, and they will\nbegin to see erosion, rust.  (cid:1)\n•  When working one-on-one with students in your beginning class, it is important\nthat the students are ready as soon as the teacher reaches them.  While other\nstudents are waiting, they must either be paying attention to what you are\ndoing…..or working on a music theory worksheet, etc.\n•  While going around the room, students should not be allowed to make sounds on\ntheir set-up—even if they have already been assisted.  They should also not be\nallowed to improperly hold their set-up (i.e. putting a finger in the bottom of their\nheadjoint…..twirling or playing with the set-up in general……etc.)\n•  The instructor must place all headjoints for students.  This may continue for\n2-5 days (if not longer), depending on the size and overall ability level of your\nclass.\n•  You should be directly in front of each individual student when assisting them,\nand not to the side. It would be most effective if students were standing and\n“finding their horizon.”  Music stands should be elevated to the proper height,\nand a mirror should be properly positioned on each stand.  You will learn to\nmaneuver around each student’s equipment, etc.  At this point, all cases should be\ndirectly under or to the side of their chairs.\n•  As you are working with each student, your goal is to assist each student in\nmaking a quality sound on or in the vicinity of the correct pitch (second space A\nflat or A).  Do not get on to students who do not produce the exact pitch—\nespecially if they are using brands flutes that may be inferior and/or not on your\nrecommended list.  When listening to each student, listen for:\no  quality of sound\no  consistency of sound\no  pitch\n•  Unless the flute is your primary instrument, you should not be modeling sounds\non the set-up.  As you assist each student, you will eventually find a “star student”\nwho will become the model for future reference.  Be sure to periodically use a\nkeyboard or a metronome—with pitches—so as not to “lose sight” of the correct\npitch (regardless of whether or not a model is used).\n•  Be aware of fragile and/or teary-eyed students. Move on to the next student in the\ninterest of time, but make an effort to return to these students by the end of class.\nDo not let a student leave class feeling unsuccessful.  If possible, offer a pass for\nstruggling students to come in at lunch or before/after school.\n•  The set-up always goes to the student; not the student to the set-up.\n•  Before bringing the set-up to the student, check for:\no  proper alignment of the cork in the headjoint\n•  Train students not to move their faces or body when you are placing the set-up. It\nmay take certain students multiple tries, and if they move after each attempt, they\n(and you!) basically have to start over each time.\n•  When students breathe, do not allow their corners to pull back at all.\nFurthermore, upper lips should not be pulling up, or back, but instead\npointed/pulled down. If you feel comfortable doing so, you may need to assist the\nstudent by touching the area between the bottom of the nose and the upper lip and\nhelp them. If you are uncomfortable, assist them with words and demonstration.\nStudents can breathe through their mouth, but if this causes them to pull back\ntheir corners, ask them to keep their face still and breathe in through the nose.\n•  With the set-up, students should think the following:\no  No articulation, use “pooh”…..not “hooh”\n•  No articulation syllable should be used when making set-up sounds.  The ultimate\ngoal is for students to start their sounds with air.  An articulation syllable will be\nassigned after all students are making characteristic and consistent sounds on the\nset-up, as well as the fully-assembled flute.\n•  Students need to direct their air down into the embouchure hole (think blowing\ninto a bottle) in order to achieve the desired sound.\n•  Make sure the students understand that “a sound” may not happen the very first\ntime. This is a trial and error process and may take multiple tries.\n•  Once the set-up has been placed correctly and students are making the sound you\nwant, they need to remember:\no  how it looks (by looking in the mirror)\no  how it feels\nAllow and instruct them to take the set-up from your hand without moving their\nbody and embouchure.  Have them try to reproduce the sound on their own.  Be\nprepared to further assist them if necessary.  When the sound is correct, students\nneed to remember how it sounds.\n•  Train students to freeze their body, face and embouchure at the end of whatever\ntype of sound is being made (whether it is air, a tone, etc.)  The student should not\nmove anything until the director calls the students to ready position.  This aspect\nof playing should transfer to any—and everything students play in the future (i.e.\nafter last notes of lines out of the book, last notes of songs, etc.)\n•  Whether students are making individual or group sounds, they need to stop when\nthey feel like they are running out of air.  It should never be thought of as a\ncontest to see who can hold their sounds the longest.  That serves absolutely no\nbenefit.\nIf a student feels dizzy or faint, allow them to bend over in their chair for a little\nwhile until they feel better.\nIf you hear fuzziness or airy sounds in the tone, the student’s aperture is likely too\nwide/big and the air is being aimed too far across.  This is usually caused by\nstudents pulling their corners back, wrong directions of air, top lip is not down\nenough, or a wide aperture.  Students need to constantly be told to bring their top\nlip down.  After a student has been made aware that they are making a fuzzy or\nairy tone, the expectation should be stated for the student to return to class the\nnext day without that issue.\n•  Extraneous noises at ends of sounds are a result of students collapsing their\nembouchures and/or postures.  Have students sing “la” or “dah”; then, apply that\nto the end of their sound.\nIt is your job, as the teacher, to diagnose any problems through this trial and error\nprocess.  As you go around the room, it may be helpful to you to take written\nnotes on students having problems.  Jot down any catchphrases, analogies or\nspecific things that you said to them that helped them in any way!\nIf you are struggling in your efforts to assist multiple students…..or are unsure\nabout what you are doing in general, then hire an outside consultant or\nexperienced private lesson teacher to come to your class and help.  As this\nprofessional goes around the room to hear your students, you need to follow\nthem……watch exactly what they are doing…..and take notes as well.  No\nmatter the scenario, reference these notes as you see fit in future classes.\n•  After _____ days, students will eventually need to be able to place their set-up\nand make a sound without your assistance.  The amount of time will vary year to\nyear, taking into consideration the size of the class, the overall quality of their\nsounds, and how many times you have assisted the students.\n•  8th Grade Only: Piccolo students should be relying on either their private lesson\nteacher or 1 on 1 sessions with a director outside of the section/ensemble\nrehearsals if they are having problems creating the proper characteristic sound.\n•  Students need to constantly be reminded that characteristic and consistent\nset-up sounds are stepping stones to making sounds on the fully-assembled\nflute!  Students who do not practice their set-up sounds at home are not only\nslowing the class down, but are not contributing to the daily progress and\nquality of the class.\n**Much of this information is applicable to beginner interviews.\nCHARACTERISTICS OF A GOOD\nFLUTE SOUND\nResonant\nConsistent\nRelaxed\nFull\nRich\nClear\nSmooth\nFocused\nVibrant\nCentered\nBuoyant\nOpen\nFree\nColorful\nUnrestricted\nFLUTE HAND POSITION\nRIGHT HAND POSITION\n1.  Allow the flute to lie back against the left shoulder.  The left hand makes a\nloose fist around the open area at the barrel of the flute.\n2.  Place the fingers first by touching the last three keys on the body of the flute\nwith the index, middle and ring finger.\n3.  The fleshy finger pad (pudgy part of your finger) should touch the pads/plugs.\n4.  Shape the hand like a “C” (flat “C” or “U” on its side).  The fleshy part should\nbe in the center of the keys.  Most flutes have circles on the keys.  These\ncircles can be used as guidelines for finger placement.\n5.  Put the little finger down next--on its side, not the fleshy part--and face\ntowards the end of the E-flat key by using the outside of the little finger.  The\nlittle finger should be curved like a question mark or a hook.  When this is\ncorrect, then have students perform the “V” exercise.\n6.  Place the thumb.  Have students gently pinch a table or music stand, and then\nrelate that to the flute.  The thumb is placed somewhere between the first and\nsecond finger, where it is most natural.  The thumb needs to go on its side.\nThe thumb and little finger are connected by tendons.  If there is tension in\none, there will be tension in the other.  Raise the big knuckles up.  They\nshould be approximately level with the keys.  Continuously watch for\n“hitchhiker” thumbs.\n7.  The thumb and first finger of the right hand should point in the same\ndirection.  Again, continually and closely watch out for “hitchhiker” thumbs,\nwhich result in the right hand fingers shifting in the wrong direction.\n8.  The right hand should never shift towards the lever Bb key; rather, it should\nbe shifted towards the Eb key.  The only time the right hand index finger will\never have contact with the lever Bb key is when that fingering is actually\nbeing used.\n9.  When the flute is lifted, move the arms from the elbows.  The shoulders are\nnot engaged, and the elbows remain in the natural position in relation to the\nshoulders.\n10. The wrist is either straight or slightly arched, but never bent toward the body\nof the flute.\n11. The part between the thumb and first finger should be soft and open.  They\nshould never touch.\n12. The middle finger will have more height/bend to it because it is a longer\nfinger, but it cannot hang over the edge.  The fingers have a slight curve, but\nthe tips of the fingers are flat.\n13. The right hand goes towards the flute, and should be parallel to the flute.\n14. The fingers of the right hand should float or hover over the keys at all times.\nStudents should “push” down the keys only when appropriate for the\nfingerings.  Be sure the palm of the hand is soft so no tension is felt or seen.\nLEFT HAND POSTION\n1.  With the flute in its upright position on the left knee and supported by the\nright hand already in its correct position, the left hand makes a light fist at the\nbarrel while the fingers are being placed.\n2.  Place the first finger on the second key-then skip one key and place the second\nand third fingers on the next two keys.\n3.  The little finger is placed on the G#/Ab key, and is curved and never leaves\nthis “home position.”  Watch for pinkies that disappear either under the flute\nor under the G#/Ab key itself.\n4.  The thumb is between 12:00 and 1:00 on the “thumb Bb” key.  The thumb\nforms a “T” with the body of the flute.\n5.  The palm is close to the body of the flute under the index finger.  The index\nfinger should touch the body of the flute and not look angular as the pad of the\nfinger touches the key.  The back of the left hand should be perpendicular to\nthe flute.  There is a slight “break” in its shape.  This can be achieved by\nrocking the left hand towards your body.\n6.  The fingers of the left hand should float or hover over the keys at all times.\n7.  The big knuckle will go somewhere between the first and second physical\nkeys.\n8.  The fingers move from the big knuckles except for the index finger, which\nmoves from the second joint.\n9.  The tip of the thumb and the base of the thumb should be on the same side of\nthe flute.\n•  As students get older and more advanced, the focus for finger movement is\nshifted from the big knuckles to where the finger tendons are attached to the\nwrist.\n•  Be patient with progress towards absolute hand position.  It is best to have\n“double jointed” students not play the flute.\n•  To teach independent finger motion, put the fingers on every key and lift each\nsingly.  Be sure all fingers move up and down, and not back and forth.  The\nsame part of the finger should touch the same place on the key every time.\n•  When hand position has been correctly mastered, the balance points on the\nfully-assembled flute are:\n1.  Right hand thumb\n2.  Left hand index finger\n3.  Ledge of chin\n4.  Right hand pinky\nItems That Will Help Hand Position\n•  Dr. Scholl’s Mole Foam Padding\n•  Bo Pep Thumb Guide for Right Hand\n•  Bo Pep Thumb Guide for Left Hand\n•  Dr. Scholl’s Corn Removers Ultra-Thin\n•  Solexa Thumb Port\n•  Prima Thumb Rest\n•  Pencil Grips\nRefer to Flute Maintenance Kit-Optional Recommended Items handout for specific\ninformation regarding each item listed above.\nAdditional Finger Exercises\n1.  All fingers in each hand move together.  Call out the hand you wish to move.  The\nstudents move all of the fingers in that hand down to seat into the pads.  The right\nhand thumb obviously does not ever move when the teacher asks for “RIGHT”,\nbut the left hand thumb will press the B-flat key with the fingers of the left hand\nwhen the teacher asks for “LEFT”.\n2.  Next, we move the fingers one at a time beginning with the left hand.  The thumb\nand first finger are already down in this exercise, and each additional finger in\nboth hands will be numbered two through six from the headjoint to the footjoint.\nThe fingers will move down or up depending on their starting position, as the\nnumber is called by the teacher.  We do not use the little fingers when we first\nbegin this exercise.  Later, they will be numbered seven and eight.\n3.  Watch the fingers to see that they move smoothly, fall into the pads, stay in\nnatural position and move up and down from the big knuckle only.  The left hand\nfirst finger is not active at this time.  The student should understand that the\nmovement is aided by the soft tissue of the palm of the hand, rather than the bony\ntexture of the top of the hand.\n4.  Next, we move the fingers in combinations: one, two….one, two three…….one,\ntwo, three, four……one, two, three, four, five…..one, two, three, four, five,\nsix………six, five, four, three, two, one……five, four, three, two, one…….four,\nthree, two, one……three, two, one………two, one……  Later in the development\nthe thumb movement is added.\n5.  Using these exercises, the fingers move in all of the ways they move to play the\nflute: all together, one at a time, and in combinations.\n6.  The left hand little finger simply moves up and down on the G#/A-flat key, and\nshould never lose contact with this key.  The right hand little finger will be\nstrengthened using the “V” exercise previously mentioned.\nFLUTE EMBOUCHURE\n•  Students must be able to use air correctly before beginning to learn the flute\nembouchure.\n•  There should be no creases near the mouth or nose that are not naturally present.\n•  The corners of mouth should be soft, forward and away from the teeth, but moved\ntoward the canine/vampire teeth.\n•  There should be a “circle of air” behind the lips.\n•  There should be a “pocket of air” between the lips and teeth.\n•  The eyes remain soft and do not change.\n•  The lower lip should be soft and fleshy—very pouty.\n•  The corners should touch the lip plate.\n•  As much lower lip as possible should touch the lip plate.\n•  The wet part of the lips surround the air.\n•  Let the air blow the lips apart.\nLip and Teeth Formations To Avoid\n•  When the embouchure is formed, a teardrop occurs when the center of the top lip\ndoes not appear to be smooth from corner to corner.  This is often referred to as a\n“bud” or as having “Betty Boop” lips.  When the wet part of the top lip is smooth,\nthe teardrop may disappear, making the wet part of the lip smooth from corner to\ncorner.  If the teardrop does not disappear, the student’s aperture will form off\ncenter.  Be aware, however, that if a student plays off center, their lips will be\ntight on one side.\n•  When working with students with very full bottom lips, set the headjoint a bit\nhigher, and gradually pull it down as the student progresses.\n•  When working with students with thin bottom lips, place the lip plate lower on the\nwhite flesh and have the student roll their bottom lip out to simulate a fuller look.\n•  Students with very thin top lips should not be recruited to play the flute.  The top\nlip is critical to correct air direction and tone production.\n•  Students with crooked or crossed/overlapped front teeth should not be recruited to\nplay to the flute.\nStrengthening the Embouchure\n•  Place a coffee stirrer/straw on the wet part of the lips and have the student “grip”\nthe straw with the inside of their lips.  This helps students understand the strength\nof their lips and the size of their aperture.\n•  For apertures that are too large, have students perform lip “pushups” with their\nstraw.  The top lip should aim the straw (air) down.  Instruct students to make the\nwet part of their lips meet…….press…..relax…..press…relax…etc.  Have\nstudents watch their faces in the mirror as they do ten exercises, and then rest.\nUpper Cheek Inflation\nUpper cheek inflation occurs when there is air allowed in the cheeks while the corners\nblow away from the teeth.  While teaching this concept, you must carefully monitor\nstudents’ aperture sizes, as they may become too large.  Students can simply think of\n“little puffs of air” or “little circles of air.”  If you do not feel comfortable teaching this\nconcept, pay an experienced flutist to help your students.  Cheek inflation is a vital\ncomponent of the “finished” flute embouchure and will help create the most resonant\ntone quality.  This concept should be taught as soon as very mature and advanced sounds\nare being produced.  This is a very effective technique for both extreme lower and\nextreme higher register playing, and should be taught either by you or a professional.\nFLUTE EXERCISES FOR GROUP SOUNDS\nGroup exercises—whether on the headjoint (“short instrument” or “baby instrument”) or\nthe fully-assembled flute—should be performed with the assumption that you have gone\naround the room as much as necessary before allowing students to make sounds on their\nown in this group setting.\nYou must make the decision as to when to allow short instruments to go home with your\nThe use of mirrors is imperative so students are consistent with everything they are doing.\nBreathing should already be introduced by this point.\nThe metronome should already be introduced by this point.\nFor exercises 1-6, articulation has not been taught at this time; therefore, “pooh” starts are\nused.  The tongue should remain naturally at the bottom of the mouth.\nRemind students to always be thinking pulse……as well as “start” and “stop” when\nappropriate.\nWhen appropriate for a specific exercise, audiation of note names with actual pitches is\nhighly recommended.\nHEADJOINT EXERCISES\n1.  Drill “ready position” and “playing/set position” DAILY.\na.  Call students to “ready position”….then to “playing/set position”….and back to\n“ready position”, etc.  For shorter/faster instructions, simply say “ready” and\n“set/playing.”\nb.  Repeat this over and over and over.\nc.  This teaches students how to set their short instruments.\nd.  Students must look at mirrors! DO NOT make them look at you.\n2.  Allow students to make sounds on their own.\na.  Students must exhibit good posture.\nb.  Students should be holding their short instrument correctly.\nc.  Students should be taking proper breaths.\nd.  You, the instructor, need to monitor students, both visually and audibly. DO NOT\nbury your head in your stand.\nFor all exercises that use the metronome, make sure students lightly tap their right hand\nfingers on the headjoint for keeping track of the beats.  Quarter note = 80 (with\nsubdivisions) is a good tempo to perform all exercises at.\n3.  With a model playing (or you if flute is your primary instrument)\na.  All students should be looking at the model, who should be standing directly\ncentered and in front of the class.  The instructor should be walking around the\nclassroom and monitoring students.\nb.   There should never be an overlap of sound between the model and the class;\nalways place a whole rest in between the model and the class.\nc.  Teach students the “start…stop” drill (using audiation).\nd.  The model and the entire class should breathe on beat 3 (when in 4/4/ time).\ne.  Sound the subdivision on the metronome at ALL TIMES. Start this at the very\nbeginning.  If students are having trouble, help them with their foot tap by putting\nyour foot on top of theirs.\nf.  During rests and while the model is playing, you must talk to students about the\nnecessity about staying completely set.  This will more quickly help students to\nlearn where exactly to place their short instrument.  The students should look so\nstill to the point they look like they are still playing!\ng.  The only embouchure movement that is allowed is for students that are having\ndifficulty making a sound…..and need to adjust something in order to achieve a\n4.  Model, Student A, Model, Student B, Model, Student C, etc.\na.  Always place a whole rest in between the model and the student.\nb.  After every few students play, have the entire class play as a group.\nc.  The model should be walking around the room with the instructor, so that all\nstudents can more easily see the model’s embouchure, etc.\nd.  Depending on the size of your class, it is your decision to have students stay in\n“playing/set position” the entire time…..or instead allow students to be in\n“playing/set position” after every __ students.\n5.  Have all students stand and play one sound; if they do not get a sound for any reason,\nthey have to sit down.  (cid:1)\na.  The metronome is not used for this exercise.\nb.  Tell students that do not get sounds that they need to practice more at home!\nc.  Have some sort of incentive for those students who are still standing at the end of\none or more rotations.\n6.  Entire class—without a model—playing whole note, whole rest, etc… with the\nmetronome.\na.  Perform this type of exercise when you feel the class is ready\nb.

The instructor or model performs random—yet not complicated rhythms, and the entire\nclass imitates (still with “pooh” … NO tongue).\na.  Perform these rhythms both with and without whole rests in between the\nmodel/instructor and the class.\nb.  It would be a good idea to incorporate rhythms—from the beginning band method\nbook used in your class—that have not yet been introduced.\n**EVERY CLASS FOR A FEW MONTHS OR SO MUST BEGIN WITH SOME SORT\nOF HEADJOINT EXERCISE!!!!**\nFULLY-ASSEMBLED FLUTE EXERCISES\n1.  The first note students should play is 3rd space C#/Db.\n•  This note can be played before teaching actual hand position.\nAt this point, hand position should already be taught.\n2.  Slur diatonic notes from third-space C down to middle C.\n•  For the very first note (third space C), students need to pull their top lip down over\ntheir top teeth and aim their air lower into the embouchure hole.\n•  There are three apertures on flute.  This particular exercise focuses on the lower\nregister, and therefore a more oval and straight across aperture is necessary for proper\ntone quality and resonance.\n3.  Teach students to play what are considered the “special” notes on flute.\n•  C♯/Db, C♮, B♮, A#/Bb\n•  For these notes (and later on an octave higher), students need to pull their top lip\ndown over their top teeth and aim their air lower into the embouchure hole.\n•  The tendencies of these “special” notes is for the tone to be airy, and the pitch to be\nsharp.\n•  By shaping the top lip and aiming the air down, the pitch will be lowered and it will\nhelp create a more resonant sound.\n•  C#/Db is THE sharpest note on the flute -- especially with a poor embouchure.\n•  You must talk the students through this process.  You should not be playing these\nnotes or demonstrating for them, unless flute is your primary instrument.\n4.  Lip push-up exercises\n•  Perform this exercise with a coffee stirrer.\n•  The goal is for the upper lip to maneuver the stirrer up and down\n•  Regarding students who are playing with apertures which are too large: remind them\nabout the size of the stirrer and relate that size to the size of their aperture.\n5.  Typical exercises you will see in most beginner method books\n•  Can be performed with or without articulation\n•  Changing notes; can be performed with or without articulation\n•  Progressive adding of more notes; can still be performed with or without\narticulation\n•  When you approach the first line in the book—which contains two or more back-\nto-back notes—these notes must obviously be articulated.  Therefore, you must\nhave already taught articulation with the proper syllable before these lines can be\nattempted.\n•  WHEN YOU TEACH ARTICULATION, YOU MUST FIRST INTRODUCE IT\nON THE HEADJOINT!!!\nFLUTE – TEACHING FINGERINGS AND USING\nFINGERING CHARTS\nIt is your choice whether or not you use the fingering chart in your book with your\n•  When you begin learning new notes, learn only a few notes per day.\no  DO NOT overwhelm your students!!\n•  3rd octave notes should not be attempted until you have taught flexibility (this should be\nby the end of the 1st semester through the beginning of the 2nd semester).\n•  Monitor unused fingers while students are playing.\no  NO FLY AWAY FINGERS!\n•  Controversial Bb\no  Expose students to all 3 Bb fingerings during the beginning year.\no  Find passages that utilize all fingerings (refer to your handout for examples).\n•  Make it your goal to teach new fingerings before you get to the new fingering (or even\nthe note itself) in the method book.\no  This will make the students feel like they are smart, and that they are moving\nmore quickly through the book.\nFlute Fingering Chart\nJohn Benzer\nC\nw\n&\nC#\n-\nw#\nDb\nwb\nD\nD#\nEb\nE\nF\nF#\nGb\nG\nA\nG#\nB\nAb\nCb\nA#\nPreferred\nBb\nPrimary\nChromatic\n2\n3\nTo lower pitch\nAdd RH pinky for stability\nFLUTE – GENERAL INFORMATION ON FINGERINGS\n•  The right hand D#/Eb key is down for almost all fingerings.\n•  When you play the first and second octave D, you must lift up the D#/Eb key.\n•  When teaching higher notes, have your students relate to what they already know from\npreviously learned fingerings to the new fingering.\nYou must use long thumb on the following notes:\nThe removal of the left hand first finger is the only difference between the following:\nThe removal of the left hand first finger is the only difference between the following notes:\nThe only notes that do not require the left hand thumb whatsoever are the following:\nFLUTE-THE THREE B-FLAT FINGERINGS\nThumb Bb:\nThumb Bb is used for the F, Bb, Eb, Ab, and Db scales.\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nLong Thumb 1 and 1 Bb (“1 and 1”):\nLong thumb 1 and 1 is used for B and Gb(F#) scales. It is used from Bb to B(Cb) when the Bb follows a\nnote that has the first finger of the RH down.\nExample 3:\nLever Bb (A#):\nLever Bb is used in the chromatic scale. Chromatic sections in music will use this position. This is also\ncalled the A# lever.\nFLUTE – EVEN EXERCISE\nThe “Even Exercise” is to instill even technique during the early stages of learning the\ninstrument.\n•  Students must think “squeeze, release” throughout the exercise.\n•  This should be taught without using music at first and without a written rhythm.\nInstead, use the phrase “I must do this exercise” to express the rhythm.\n•  As presented on this page, use note names before using notes in the staff. This\nallows the student to easily think “squeeze, release” and perform correct finger\nmovement.\nFLUTE EVEN EXERCISE PATTERNS\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\nB   C    B   C    B   C    B\n“I must do this ex- er- cise.”\nA   B    A   B    A   B   A\nG   A    G   A   G   A   G\nF    G    F   G    F   G   F\nE    F    E    F   E    F   E\nD    E   D    E   D   E   D\nC    D   C    D   C   D  C\n•  On the following page, the exercises are the same except for the fact that the\nnotes are on a musical staff.\n(continued)\n•  Use note names before using notes in the staff. This allows the student to easily\nthink “squeeze, release” and perform correct finger movement.\nAfter the previous steps have been completed, the student may then read the patterns\ndictated on the staff.\nFLUTE ARTICULATION\n•  Do not attempt to teach articulation until all students are producing characteristic\nand consistent sounds on the headjoint, as well as the entire flute.\nIntroduce articulation using only the headjoint.\n•  The tongue is down 98% and up 2% of the time.\n•  The tongue moves up and down, not back and forth.\n•  The purpose of the tongue is to release the air which causes the air to interact with\nthe embouchure hole which creates the sound. The tongue's release of the air\nsimply defines the beginning/start of the vibration/sound.\n•  Articulation is used to define the vibrations necessary to create musical rhythm,\nstyle and movement -- to contrast the use of slurring (which also creates similar\nmusical entities).\n•  Use the syllable \"too\" or \"toe\" when articulating. This moves the tongue forward\ninside the mouth. These syllables will be very appropriate with most beginning\nflute students.\n•  The tongue should lie flat in the mouth and should feel soft.\n•  Make sure the sides of the students' tongues are inactive and close to the top teeth\nrather than the bottom teeth.\n•  Use the syllable \"toe\" or \"tah\" with students that play with the sides of their\ntongue anchored against their top teeth.\n•  One taste bud of the student's tongue should be used.\n•  The articulation does not stop the sound.\n•  There should be no movement in the face, chin or throat. All that moves when the\nstudent articulates is the air and the tongue as it releases the air.\n•  Once the student can successfully use the tongue, use appropriate exercises.\n•  The tip of the tongue touches the tooth/gum line of the top teeth (more enamel\nthan gum) and must return to the same spot with the same energy every time.\n•  An advanced style of articulation from the French school allows students to\narticulate between their lips. The syllable used with this style is \"th\" or \"thee.\"\nThis concept is not recommended with beginning flute students.\nYOU WILL NOW BE SHOWN COMBINED EXERCISES THAT WILL HELP\nIMPROVE THE STUDENT’S TONE QUALITY IN ALL OF THE REGISTERS,\nINCREASE RANGE, CREATE EVEN ARTICULATION IN ALL REGISTERS,\nAND TEACH YOUNG STUDENTS HOW TO CONTROL THE ENTIRE\nINSTRUMENT DURING THE FIRST YEAR.\nFLUTE ARTICULATION EXERCISES\n•  When starting articulation exercises, the use of mirrors is vital.\n•  Remind students that the tongue only interrupts the air – it never stops the air.\n•  Articulating with black notes as opposed to white notes, encourages students to move\ntheir tongues down quicker.\n•  Make sure from the very beginning, students sing and play in a connected/legato style.\n•  Exercises to be taught in the following order:\n1.  Have students sing on “la” or “lu,” and then ultimately on the syllable “too” or “toe.”\nIf students are unable to sing in a connected style, they should not progress to the next\nstep.\n2.  Have students put their hand or index finger in front of their face and feel their air.\nStudents should feel continuous air and not “puffs” of air.\n3.  Go around the room and have each student tongue air at your hand, so you can assess\ntheir ability to do it correctly.\n4.  Students should not see their aperture size changing as they articulate.\n5.  Using a mirror, students should articulate with or without their hand/index finger,\nmaking sure that their face, chin, throat and aperture are not moving.\n6.  When you feel students have mastered the previous exercises, allow them to articulate\n– using the syllable “too” or “toe” – on the headjoint and off the lip plate.  They\nshould still be able to see their vapor trail.\n7.  Allow students to articulate as fast as they can, articulate using the “ta-day” syllable.\n8.  Allow the students to start the sound and use the “ta-day” syllable.\n9.  Allow the students to start the sound and articulate by snapping your finger on\ncommand.\n10. With the metronome, begin to incorporate easy follow-the-leader rhythms with you\nsinging or modeling – and the students echoing on their headjoint.  Whole rests may\nor may not be necessary between you and the students.  As with your initial sound\nproduction exercises, students need to continue lightly tapping each beat on the end of\nthe headjoint while they are playing.  This ensures that students are thinking internal\nsubdivision.\n11. Before progressing to the fully-assembled flute, assign the following playing test on\nthe headjoint:\n•  Attach the headjoint to the body of the flute and begin articulation.  Students must be\nconstantly reminded that they should be articulating in the same way as they were when\njust using the headjoint.\n•  Whether students are playing white notes or black notes, they must constantly be\nreminded that the tongue moves down quickly.\n•  When students can successfully sing note names on the same pitch, allow them to\narticulate multiple notes on the same pitch.\n•  When pulse and foot pat are learned, students articulate every time their foot touches the\nfloor – and then when their foot touches the floor and as it comes up.\n•  Once the student is able to read music, call the articulation “rhythmic articulation.”\nStudents should be tonguing as the music moves across the page.\n•  Do not allow students to articulate back-to-back notes on different pitches until they are\nplaying with absolute connected style on notes of the same pitch.\n•  When the tongue is moving correctly, you must decide when it is appropriate to have\nstudents begin coordinating finger movement with articulation.\n•  When students articulate back-to-back notes on different pitches, they cannot stop their\nair as they change fingerings.\n•  Teach Mary Had a Little Lamb in four segments by singing and then playing:\n•  After all students have successfully played each segment of Mary Had a Little Lamb,\nbegin to string together the segments into the following finished product:\n•  Ultimately, students should be able to execute any or all of the following on a daily basis:\no  articulate as fast as they can\no  articulate using the “ta-day” syllable\no  articulate on command\no  articulate with foot pat and articulate rhythms\n•  When playing exercises out of the method book, you can return to previously-learned\nlines and add articulation.  Do not feel like all lines must be executed again during class;\nassign students to perform all lines at home with articulation.\nFLUTE-LEVELS OF ACHIEVEMENT FOR\nARTICULATION\nIntroduces skill of tonguing and finger change at the same time\nIntroduces skill of tonguing and multiple finger changes within a measure\n4 Teaching Techniques\n1.

PLAY ☺\nFLUTE – WORKING OUT BLIPS AND\nFINGER/TONGUE COORDINATION PROBLEMS\nBlips\nBlips can be defined as the uncoordinated movement of multiple fingers that should\nbe moving at the same time—but are not.  As with the teaching of all woodwind\ninstruments, the most problematic fingers in both hands are the ring finger and the\npinky.  Most blips occur with the use of either or both of these fingers.\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 1-2 involve moving\ntwo fingers on one hand at the same time.\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 3-4 involve moving or\nexchanging three fingers on one hand at the same time.\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 5-6 involve moving or\nexchanging multiple fingers on both hands at the same time.\n•  For lines 1-6:\n•  Students should articulate every note.\n•  Students can audiate the counting while they are positioning.\n•  Students can audiate the note names while they are positioning.\n•  Students can audiate “long…short long….short long…short long,” while\nthey are positioning.\nIn the event you have not yet taught dotted rhythms to your students, these\nexercises are already reinforcing a very challenging rhythm--in general--\nthat students will encounter all the way through their public school\nexperience.\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 7-8 involve moving\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 9-10 involve moving\nor exchanging three fingers on one hand at the same time.\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 11-12 involve moving\nor exchanging multiple fingers on both hands at the same time.\n•  For lines 7-12:\n•  Students should slur every note.\n•  Students can perform these exercises without articulating.\n•  Using the same note names as lines 1-12, lines 13-18 are notated with the\nrhythms inverted.\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 13-14 involve moving\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 15-16 involve moving\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 17-18 involve moving\n•  For lines 13-18:\n•  Students can audiate “short long…short long….short long…short,” while\n•  Using the same note names as lines 1-12, lines 19-24 are notated with the\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 19-20 involve moving\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 21-22 involve moving\n•  Through the use of the following uneven rhythms, lines 23-24 involve moving\n•  For lines 19-24:\nMISCELLANEOUS\n•  These exercises can be very effective, but must be audiated--in the various\nways previously discussed--and positioned at the same time.\n•  Playing tests can and should be given on these exercises to promote their\nregular practice.\n•  While positioning and/or performing these lines, it is imperative that students’\nfingers are hovering and staying very close to the keys.  If students’ fingers\nare too far away from the keys, these exercises will not be effective in\npreventing blips.\n•  Fingering patterns found in these exercises will more than likely appear in\nvirtually every genre of music, whether it be scales, All-Region/All-State\netudes, performance music, etc.\nFinger/Tongue Coordination Problems\nThere are two types of finger/tongue coordination problems that occur when passages are\narticulated:\n1.  students changing to the next fingering before they articulate (most common)\n2.  students articulating before they change to the next fingering\n•  Students can audiate the counting.\n•  Students can audiate the note names.\n•  Students can use their air and position through their embouchures—without\nactually producing sounds/vibrations.\n(cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4)\n(cid:1) (cid:2)\n(cid:5)(cid:4)\n(cid:5)\n(cid:2) (cid:3)\n(cid:1) (cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4)\n(cid:1) (cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:3)\nFLUTE SET 2\nLevel 1\n(cid:6)\n(cid:7)(cid:4)\n(cid:7)\n(cid:3)(cid:4)\n(cid:3)\nLevel 2\n(cid:8)(cid:9)\n(cid:10)\n(cid:9)\n(cid:8)\n(cid:7)(cid:9)\n(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)\n(cid:8) (cid:7)(cid:9)\n(cid:1) (cid:3)(cid:4)\n(cid:1) (cid:3)\nFLUTE SET 3\n(cid:7)(cid:3)\n(cid:7)(cid:3)(cid:4)\nFLUTE SET 4\nFLUTE SET 5\n(cid:3)(cid:7)\n(cid:5)(cid:7)\nLevel 3\nLevel 4\nFLUTE SET 7\nOne Octave Chromatic Scale - Level 1\n(cid:1) (cid:2)(cid:2)\n(cid:3)(cid:6)\nChromatic Scale - Level 2\nChromatic Scale - Level 3\n(cid:3)(cid:10)\n(cid:1) (cid:3)(cid:6)\n[Title]\nChromatic Scale - Level 4\n(cid:11)\n(cid:12)\nFLUTE FLEXIBILITY\n•  The embouchure must be flexible so your students can change registers easily,\nplay with a consistent sound from top to bottom, and play with correct intonation\nin the upper register.\n•  Aperture shapes:\nWhen playing in the low register, the aperture is oval or cigar shaped.\nWhen playing in the middle register, the aperture is oval or cigar shaped but\nsmaller.\nWhen playing in the upper register, the aperture shape is smaller and round.\n•  Changing registers:  The jaw and corners literally come forward.  The aperture\nshape will resemble the shape when whistling.  Use more top lip when playing in\nthe lower register to aim the air down.  When starting in the lower register, the air\nspeed should be very fast and should move forward.  In general, the air should\ncome more forward the higher the student plays.\n•  Utilize the syllables “eee/eih”…… “ewww” when moving from the low sound to\nthe high sound.\n•  Practice flexibility going from low to high before going high to low.\nFlexibility Exercises\n•  Using just the headjoint, have students cover the open end with their right hand.\nPlay the low sound…then slide to the high sound.\n•  Play the low sound……the high sound……the low sound.\n•  These same kinds of exercise can be done with the open end of the headjoint\nuncovered.\n•  Add the metronome to this activity when students have met your expectations.\nWhen playing the octave at the end of each measure, students will need to use a\nlot of focused air because the change happens quickly.  This is especially true in\nthe last measure of the exercise.  The descending notes must move quickly so the\nstudents will have enough air in reserve to execute the octave in each capsule.\n•  As students progress, another octave can be added to the end of each capsule.\n•  Octave Slurs—refer to Set 1/Octave Slurs\n•  Advanced students can use the harmonics in Set 6 to develop more flexibility and\nstrength.  Harmonics should be taught in very small groups and/or private\nlessons….never in a large class setting.  Embouchures can easily become tight if\ncareful monitoring is not observed.\nCreating a Resonant Upper Register\n•  The corners and jaw come forward.\n•  The bottom lip may turn out or come forward in order to blow more across the\nembouchure hole.\n•  There should be more air behind the lips.  The cheeks inflate more and more as\nyou ascend.\n•  The teeth need to stay apart, because they tend to close.\n•  Let the jaw be open—do not force it.\n•  The tongue should stay forward and soft.  It must not arch.  If young students tend\nto play above center, their tongue may be pulled back into their throat or their\nembouchure may be too tight.  These problems will result in students playing with\nshrill and harsh sounds.\n•  The corners of the mouth and lips should remain soft.\nCreating a Resonant Lower Register\n•  Blow air across to the outer edge of the lip plate.\n•  Students should never be allowed to pull their corners back into a smile.  The lips\nshould never be stretched against the canine/vampire teeth.\n•  The lower register will be very difficult to produce if the headjoint is placed too\nhigh on the lower lip.\n•  Shape with the top lip to project a more focused and resonant sound.\nFLUTE SET 1\nOctave Slurs - Level 1\n(cid:4)\nOctave Slurs - Level 2\nOctave Slurs - Level 3\nOctave Slurs - Level 4\n(cid:1) (cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:5)\n(cid:1) (cid:5)\nOctave Slurs - Level 5\nOctave Slurs - Level 6\nOctave Slurs - Level 7\n(cid:5)(cid:7)(cid:9)\n(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:9)\n(cid:5)(cid:6)\n(cid:2) (cid:5)\n(cid:1) (cid:5)(cid:6)\nOctave Slurs - Level 8\n(cid:1) (cid:5)(cid:7)\n(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:9)\n(cid:10)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:9)\nFLUTE SET 6\nHarmonics\nHarmonic slurs are notes that are \"overblown\" from the fundamental tone.\nThis exercise is important for developing flexibility and strength in your embouchure.\n(cid:4)(cid:6)\nFLUTE, CLARINET, AND ALTO SAXOPHONE\nOCTAVE AND REGISTER EXERCISES\nSet 1\n∑\nClarinet in Bb\nAlto Sax.\n44\nFl.\nBb Cl.\nA. Sx.\n4\nSet 2\nSet 3\nSet 4\nFLUTE VIBRATO\n•  Do not introduce vibrato until students are producing consistent, resonant sounds.\n•  Breathing expectations should be met before introducing vibrato.\n•  Vibrato  will  be  more  easily  taught  if  introduced  on  the  headjoint  rather  than  on\n•  Vibrato  is  usually  introduced  during  the  second  semester.    Teaching  vibrato  in\ngeneral should NOT be optional during the second semester of the beginning\nyear.\n•  The jaw and lips do not move when learning vibrato.\n•  The  cheeks  do  move,  because  the  air  pressure  is  changing  inside  the  student’s\nPHASE ONE\nThe  pulse  should  be  super  wide  and  exaggerated  so  it  will  not  disappear  as  it\nbecomes  faster  and  narrower.    If  it  starts  narrow,  it  will  disappear  to  virtually\nnothing.  Do not shy away from absurdity.\n1.  Have the student bend over from the hips.\n2.  Say “ha” with his hand on his stomach so the pulse can be felt.\n3.  First pulses are unmetered and the student should slowly move to normal standing\nposture—approximately  two  inches  at  a  time--as  he  progresses  through  this\nprocedure.\n4.  After  expectations  thus  far  have  been  met,  the  pulses  should  become  metered.\nThe metronome should be set between 60 and 80.\n5.  The syllables used for a whole note in 4/4 time are “Ta-Ha-Ha-Ha” followed by\nfour beats of rest.  Repeat this procedure each time as the student moves into the\nnext position.\n6.  Eventually, more active pulses can be introduced.  These pulses do not require the\nbent  posture  and  therefore  must  not  be  introduced  until  other  expectations  have\nbeen met.\n7.  Repeat the procedure with the flute attached to the headjoint beginning on treble\nclef third-line “B.”\n•  PHASE TWO\n1.  Once  PHASE  ONE  expectations  have  been  met,  have  students  transfer  from\npulses to throat “clicks.”\n2.  Have  students  say  “eh”  (the  throat  click)…almost  like  when  a  frustrated  child\nsays “Mom, eh” when angry.\n3.  Begin with quarter note clicks, and eventually use more active subdivisions.  Fill\nin time with active air.\n4.  The movement should be wide and “through the sound.”  The movement should\nbe sharp and flat….and loud and soft…at the same time.\nFLUTE CHRISTMAS TUNES\n4 œ\n& 4\nœ\n˙\nœb\nJingle Bells\nGood King Wenceslas\n4 œb\n˙b\n& œb\nÓ"

    "text": "FLUTE HEADJOINT PLACEMENT\nAND FIRST SOUND\n•\nIf your class is really large, the teacher may want to schedule a 10-15 minute slot\nwith each student before or after school in order to place the headjoint.  Whether\ndone in class or individually, the teacher should be able to see the student’s face\nduring this procedure.  It is assumed that students are exhibiting correct “playing\nposture” at all times.  If this procedure is done in class, the teacher must place\neach student’s headjoint for several days.\n•  Once the teacher has guided the student for as long as necessary, he may begin to\nplace the headjoint on his own.  The following steps will take place with careful\nmonitoring from the teacher:\n1.  Students should pick up the headjoint with their fingertips, which are facing each\nother on the crown and at the other end of the headjoint--but not covering the\nopening.  If the fingertips are facing the student, he may tend to roll in or press.\n2.  The headjoint should rest on the “ledge” or “crook” of the chin.\nThere should be no pressure on the jaw.  The headjoint should not be jammed\nagainst the face.\n3.  The students will always direct their air toward the center of the embouchure hole.\n4.  With the headjoint on the ledge or crook of the chin, the edge of the embouchure\nhole will touch where the red and fleshy part of the skin meet.\n5.  The center of the aperture should line up with the center of the embouchure hole.\n6.  The lower lip should cover 1/4-1/3 of the embouchure hole.\n7.  The lower lip should be very “pouty.”  There should be as much lower lip on\nthe lip plate as possible.\nThe flute should line up four ways:\n1.  Left to right\n~The center of aperture should line up with the center of the embouchure hole.  If\nit is off center, move the headjoint to the position of the student’s aperture.  When the\nflute is in its correct playing position, a “pie wedge” is created between the body and\nthe instrument.  This will be demonstrated.\n2.  Front to back\n~The headjoint should not be crooked.  It should be parallel to the lips, but not\nparallel to the body.  There needs to be enough contact so the headjoint will not\n“bounce around.”\n3.  Up and down\n~The headjoint should not slant up and down.  Always center the embouchure\nhole to the aperture.  If the aperture is off center, then move the headjoint to the\ncenter of the student’s aperture.\n4.  In and out\n~As stated above, the lower lip should cover 1/4-1/3 of the embouchure hole.\n•  The outside of the lip plate has to be touched by air to get a great sound.\n(cid:1)  This means there is more air going into the flute -- when it splits,\nstudents will get their most centered, focused and resonant sound\n•  After headjoint is placed and lined up, then students blow\n(cid:1)  1  2  Breathe  |  Sound\n(3   4)\n(cid:1)  air  2  3  4  |  stop  2  breathe\n(3  4)\n(cid:2)\nremind students often to bring the corners forward -- just like\ndrinking water out of a water fountain!\nFirst Sound\n1.  With a natural face, have the student say the word “pooh.”  Look and see where\ntheir lips open naturally, as well as where the lips come apart first.  The tongue\nmust be down under the lower lip, because the tongue is not being used at this\npoint.\n2.  Blow a kiss and freeze it -- no pucker -- a soft kiss.  Students should feel how\ntheir lips move away from their teeth during this process.  The corners should\nalways close in from the sides.\n3.  The aperture is the opening between the lips.  Some apertures will be slightly off\ncenter.  More control can be achieved if the opening is directly in the center of the\nmouth.\n4.  Start with lips touching, and then blow a hole in the center with a “p” sound.  The\nlower lip cannot be behind the upper lip; if it is, then the air will point down.\n5.  Have students think “pooh”--and “p”--as the air moves past their lips.  There\nshould be no vocal sound produced.\n6.  In reality, sound is produced on the flute headjoint as the air moves in relation to\nthe embouchure hole.\n7.  Correct placement will result in a vapor trail (condensation in a V-shape) being\nvisible on the lip plate.  Students producing sounds without vapor trails are\nplaying either too tight and/or not having enough space between their teeth.\n•  Discourage the “kiss and roll” technique (kissing the center of the embouchure\nhole and then rolling out), as this allows too many variables regarding correct\nheadjoint placement.\n•  Discourage students from rolling in their headjoints too far in general."

The tongue's release of the air\nsimply defines the beginning/start of the vibration/sound.\n•  Articulation is used to define the vibrations necessary to create musical rhythm,\nstyle and movement -- to contrast the use of slurring (which also creates similar\nmusical entities).\n•  Use the syllable \"too\" or \"toe\" when articulating. This moves the tongue forward\ninside the mouth. These syllables will be very appropriate with most beginning\nflute students.\n•  The tongue should lie flat in the mouth and should feel soft.\n•  Make sure the sides of the students' tongues are inactive and close to the top teeth\nrather than the bottom teeth.\n•  Use the syllable \"toe\" or \"tah\" with students that play with the sides of their\ntongue anchored against their top teeth.\n•  One taste bud of the student's tongue should be used.\n•  The articulation does not stop the sound.\n•  There should be no movement in the face, chin or throat. All that moves when the\nstudent articulates is the air and the tongue as it releases the air.\n•  Once the student can successfully use the tongue, use appropriate exercises.\n•  The tip of the tongue touches the tooth/gum line of the top teeth (more enamel\nthan gum) and must return to the same spot with the same energy every time.\n•  An advanced style of articulation from the French school allows students to\narticulate between their lips. The syllable used with this style is \"th\" or \"thee.\"\nThis concept is not recommended with beginning flute students.\nYOU WILL NOW BE SHOWN COMBINED EXERCISES THAT WILL HELP\nIMPROVE THE STUDENT’S TONE QUALITY IN ALL OF THE REGISTERS,\nINCREASE RANGE, CREATE EVEN ARTICULATION IN ALL REGISTERS,\nAND TEACH YOUNG STUDENTS HOW TO CONTROL THE ENTIRE\nINSTRUMENT DURING THE FIRST YEAR."

A tear\ndrop occurs when the lips come together at a point, resulting in air that splits.\nStudents with teardrops should be steered towards another instrument.\n(cid:1)  There are many outstanding flute players that play to the side, but unless you are\nexperienced at teaching this type of flute embouchure, you should avoid placing\nstudents on flute if they have an extreme teardrop or “crooked embouchure” and must\nplay to the side.  It is very time consuming, and could be very frustrating at first for\nthe student and teacher.  Many times, it can take days…..or even weeks…….to\nproduce acceptable first flute sounds.\n(cid:1)  Avoid placing students on flute who have an extreme overbite or underbite.\n(cid:1)\nIf a student has a protruding tooth, have them close their lips and push where the\nheadjoint will end up being placed.  If that “sensation” is painful to the student, then\nthey should be steered towards an instrument that goes into their mouth.\n(cid:1)  The jaw must be flexible.\n(cid:1)  Students with braces will most likely struggle in general, especially if they start in\nbeginning class without braces.  Encourage parents to inquire with their child’s\ndentist regarding the possibility of using Invisalign.\nNon-Physical Characteristics/Factors\n(cid:1)  There should be no gender bias when selecting flute players; however, you must\nconsider the school climate/demographics when choosing a boy to play the flute.\nKeep in mind that some of the most famous flautists in the world are male (i.e. Sir\nJames Galway, Jean-Pierre Rampal, Julius Baker, etc.)  Therefore, if a boy expresses\ngenuine interest in playing the flute, then move forward from that point.\n(cid:1)  Be prepared to do whatever you have to in order to convince parents—especially\nfathers—that boys can play flute. You may need to do this without the student there;\nstudents should not be present during a discussion that may be getting uncomfortable.\nIf you have boy flute players in your top ensemble, it is an excellent idea to have\nthem demonstrate the flute at your recruiting concert(s)….regardless of their chair."

The left hand makes a\nloose fist around the open area at the barrel of the flute.\n2.  Place the fingers first by touching the last three keys on the body of the flute\nwith the index, middle and ring finger.\n3.  The fleshy finger pad (pudgy part of your finger) should touch the pads/plugs.\n4.  Shape the hand like a “C” (flat “C” or “U” on its side).  The fleshy part should\nbe in the center of the keys.  Most flutes have circles on the keys.  These\ncircles can be used as guidelines for finger placement.\n5.  Put the little finger down next--on its side, not the fleshy part--and face\ntowards the end of the E-flat key by using the outside of the little finger.  The\nlittle finger should be curved like a question mark or a hook.  When this is\ncorrect, then have students perform the “V” exercise.\n6.  Place the thumb.  Have students gently pinch a table or music stand, and then\nrelate that to the flute.  The thumb is placed somewhere between the first and\nsecond finger, where it is most natural.  The thumb needs to go on its side.\nThe thumb and little finger are connected by tendons.  If there is tension in\none, there will be tension in the other.  Raise the big knuckles up.  They\nshould be approximately level with the keys.  Continuously watch for\n“hitchhiker” thumbs.\n7.  The thumb and first finger of the right hand should point in the same\ndirection.  Again, continually and closely watch out for “hitchhiker” thumbs,\nwhich result in the right hand fingers shifting in the wrong direction.\n8.  The right hand should never shift towards the lever Bb key; rather, it should\nbe shifted towards the Eb key.  The only time the right hand index finger will\never have contact with the lever Bb key is when that fingering is actually\nbeing used.\n9.  When the flute is lifted, move the arms from the elbows.  The shoulders are\nnot engaged, and the elbows remain in the natural position in relation to the\nshoulders.\n10. The wrist is either straight or slightly arched, but never bent toward the body\nof the flute.\n11. The part between the thumb and first finger should be soft and open.  They\nshould never touch.\n12. The middle finger will have more height/bend to it because it is a longer\nfinger, but it cannot hang over the edge.  The fingers have a slight curve, but\nthe tips of the fingers are flat.\n13. The right hand goes towards the flute, and should be parallel to the flute.\n14. The fingers of the right hand should float or hover over the keys at all times.\nStudents should “push” down the keys only when appropriate for the\nfingerings.  Be sure the palm of the hand is soft so no tension is felt or seen.\nLEFT HAND POSTION\n1.  With the flute in its upright position on the left knee and supported by the\nright hand already in its correct position, the left hand makes a light fist at the\nbarrel while the fingers are being placed.\n2.  Place the first finger on the second key-then skip one key and place the second\nand third fingers on the next two keys.\n3.  The little finger is placed on the G#/Ab key, and is curved and never leaves\nthis “home position.”  Watch for pinkies that disappear either under the flute\nor under the G#/Ab key itself.\n4.  The thumb is between 12:00 and 1:00 on the “thumb Bb” key.  The thumb\nforms a “T” with the body of the flute.\n5.  The palm is close to the body of the flute under the index finger.  The index\nfinger should touch the body of the flute and not look angular as the pad of the\nfinger touches the key.  The back of the left hand should be perpendicular to\nthe flute.  There is a slight “break” in its shape.  This can be achieved by\nrocking the left hand towards your body.\n6.  The fingers of the left hand should float or hover over the keys at all times.\n7.  The big knuckle will go somewhere between the first and second physical\nkeys.\n8.  The fingers move from the big knuckles except for the index finger, which\nmoves from the second joint.\n9.  The tip of the thumb and the base of the thumb should be on the same side of\nthe flute.\n•  As students get older and more advanced, the focus for finger movement is\nshifted from the big knuckles to where the finger tendons are attached to the\nwrist.\n•  Be patient with progress towards absolute hand position.  It is best to have\n“double jointed” students not play the flute.\n•  To teach independent finger motion, put the fingers on every key and lift each\nsingly.  Be sure all fingers move up and down, and not back and forth.  The\nsame part of the finger should touch the same place on the key every time.\n•  When hand position has been correctly mastered, the balance points on the\nfully-assembled flute are:\n1.  Right hand thumb\n2.  Left hand index finger\n3.  Ledge of chin\n4.  Right hand pinky\nItems That Will Help Hand Position\n•  Dr. Scholl’s Mole Foam Padding\n•  Bo Pep Thumb Guide for Right Hand\n•  Bo Pep Thumb Guide for Left Hand\n•  Dr. Scholl’s Corn Removers Ultra-Thin\n•  Solexa Thumb Port\n•  Prima Thumb Rest\n•  Pencil Grips\nRefer to Flute Maintenance Kit-Optional Recommended Items handout for specific\ninformation regarding each item listed above.\nAdditional Finger Exercises\n1.  All fingers in each hand move together.  Call out the hand you wish to move.  The\nstudents move all of the fingers in that hand down to seat into the pads.  The right\nhand thumb obviously does not ever move when the teacher asks for “RIGHT”,\nbut the left hand thumb will press the B-flat key with the fingers of the left hand\nwhen the teacher asks for “LEFT”.\n2.  Next, we move the fingers one at a time beginning with the left hand.  The thumb\nand first finger are already down in this exercise, and each additional finger in\nboth hands will be numbered two through six from the headjoint to the footjoint.\nThe fingers will move down or up depending on their starting position, as the\nnumber is called by the teacher.  We do not use the little fingers when we first\nbegin this exercise.  Later, they will be numbered seven and eight.\n3.  Watch the fingers to see that they move smoothly, fall into the pads, stay in\nnatural position and move up and down from the big knuckle only.  The left hand\nfirst finger is not active at this time.  The student should understand that the\nmovement is aided by the soft tissue of the palm of the hand, rather than the bony\ntexture of the top of the hand.\n4.  Next, we move the fingers in combinations: one, two….one, two three…….one,\ntwo, three, four……one, two, three, four, five…..one, two, three, four, five,\nsix………six, five, four, three, two, one……five, four, three, two, one…….four,\nthree, two, one……three, two, one………two, one……  Later in the development\nthe thumb movement is added.\n5.  Using these exercises, the fingers move in all of the ways they move to play the\nflute: all together, one at a time, and in combinations.\n6.  The left hand little finger simply moves up and down on the G#/A-flat key, and\nshould never lose contact with this key.  The right hand little finger will be\nstrengthened using the “V” exercise previously mentioned."

    "text": "CHOOSING PICCOLO PLAYERS AND AUDITIONS\nFactors Involved for Selecting Piccolo Players\n•  One piccolo player can be used in a middle school program--ONLY in the top band.\nHaving a piccolo should not detract from the ensemble; you can always rewrite the\npart for the first flute player.  There are a few exceptions when two piccolo players\nare necessary for a particular piece of music (Marche Des Parachutistes Belges by\nPierre Leemans).\n•  Do not showcase the piccolo at a recruiting concert unless you explain that only one\nflute player in your entire program gets to play it (and usually that player is an eighth\ngrader).\n•  Do not even mention or talk about using a piccolo in your band unless you think you\nhave a student physically capable of playing it…..and are planning to program a piece\nof music in which utilizing a piccolo will be necessary.\n•  Do not sacrifice your flute section by having the top player play piccolo.  The student\nplaying piccolo must sound good, because once a piccolo is added to an ensemble\nsound, it is hard to hide.  ☺  You must also have “remaining” top flute players in your\nsection that also sound good and can handle the first part.\n•  Choose a student with a naturally small aperture and with thin lips.  Students having\nfuller lips will have difficulty with flexibility and focusing their sound.\nAuditions for Piccolo\n•  Wait a month or two after school starts before you even start mentioning the\npossibility of utilizing a piccolo in your ensemble.\n•  If at all possible, allow an 8th grader to play the piccolo over a 7th grader.\n•  Do not encourage or allow any flute player to have their parents go out and buy a\npiccolo.  This is extremely presumptuous, unfair to other students and in general\ninappropriate.  Do not allow yourself to be “strong-armed” into anything regarding\nthe selection of a piccolo player.\n•  In most cases a school-owned piccolo will be used.  With that said, make sure that it\nis good playing condition and have someone you trust test its playing condition.\nWooden piccolos are preferable to plastic and metal piccolos for inside playing.\nPlastic piccolos are preferable to metal piccolos for marching band purposes.\n•  Find out how many students are interested in trying out for the piccolo.\n•  Consult with your private lesson teacher or colleague regarding what the audition\nshould consist of.\n•  Give the piccolo to each student for one school night each so that they have equal\ntime to play on it and practice.  It is not fair to give a student the piccolo over the\nweekend.\n•  Have auditions the day after the last week night that a student had the piccolo at\nhome.\n•  Hire someone from the outside to hear the audition.  Try to select a band director or\nprivate lesson flautist; even if someone on your staff is a flautist.  This way,\ndisgruntled parents will not be able to say that the auditions were in anyway unfair.\n•  Once the student is officially selected, do not encourage he/she to buy their own\npiccolo because there is no guarantee that they will play it as a 9th or 10th grader in\nhigh school.  Now in knowing that there is no guarantee that they will be allowed or\nhave the opportunity to play piccolo in high school, the student’s parents may still\nwant to purchase a piccolo!  This can only be a good thing, because the newly-\npurchased piccolo may be in better condition than your school-owned piccolo(s)!\n•  If the official student is really good and is probable to succeed, allow them to play\npiccolo at your Winter Concert (or right after the winter break).\nWarm-ups\n•  Your piccolo player should warm-up half the time on their flute and half the time on\nthe piccolo.  This is so the student does not “lose” their flute chops…….and because\nthey may not end up playing the piccolo on all music being performed in the\nensemble at any given performance during the school year.\n•  Your piccolo player must use a doubler stand—whether they are able to purchase one\nor you acquire one through your budget.  You should never allow a piccolo to be\n“housed” on the music stand when not in use.  (cid:2)\n•  Avoid having your piccolo player go back and forth between flute and piccolo in your\nprogrammed music. Going back and forth between a multi-movement piece is ok, but\nnot within movements.\n•  When utilizing a piccolo in your ensemble, be smart about what to play.\n•  Encourage and allow your piccolo player to use a violin clip-on tuner.  With that said,\nthe piccolo player should not be required to look at the director during warm-up\nexercises that are to be memorized by all other members of the ensemble.\n•  When looking at the tuner, do not allow the piccolo player to look down.  This will\nresult in he/she looking down and thus rolling in and covering too much of the\nembouchure hole.  (cid:2)  The music stand needs to be at the appropriate height.\n.\nTendencies\n•  When a student transfers from flute to piccolo, monitor carefully as they will tend to\n•\nroll in and cover too much of the embouchure hole.\nIn general, students playing piccolo will tend to play more “pinched” because the\naperture tends to be smaller.\n•  After a student begins playing the piccolo, almost everything will be flat.  Until the\nstudent gets “used to it” after several weeks (if not longer), be patient with their\nintonation.\n•  With more experienced players, the pitch tendency on piccolo is to play sharp.\nRegion-Band (Middle and High School)\n•  Do not just “throw” someone on piccolo just to get another student into region-band.\n•  Do not force students into a bad audition situation just because they play piccolo.\nThis experience may result in long-term negative effects for the student.\n•  You may want to suggest that your piccolo player bring ear plugs into the audition\nroom(s)."

    "text": "FLUTE ARTICULATION EXERCISES\n•  When starting articulation exercises, the use of mirrors is vital.\n•  Remind students that the tongue only interrupts the air – it never stops the air.\n•  Articulating with black notes as opposed to white notes, encourages students to move\ntheir tongues down quicker.\n•  Make sure from the very beginning, students sing and play in a connected/legato style.\n•  Exercises to be taught in the following order:\n1.  Have students sing on “la” or “lu,” and then ultimately on the syllable “too” or “toe.”\nIf students are unable to sing in a connected style, they should not progress to the next\nstep.\n2.  Have students put their hand or index finger in front of their face and feel their air.\nStudents should feel continuous air and not “puffs” of air.\n3.  Go around the room and have each student tongue air at your hand, so you can assess\ntheir ability to do it correctly.\n4.  Students should not see their aperture size changing as they articulate.\n5.  Using a mirror, students should articulate with or without their hand/index finger,\nmaking sure that their face, chin, throat and aperture are not moving.\n6.  When you feel students have mastered the previous exercises, allow them to articulate\n– using the syllable “too” or “toe” – on the headjoint and off the lip plate.  They\nshould still be able to see their vapor trail.\n7.  Allow students to articulate as fast as they can, articulate using the “ta-day” syllable.\n8.  Allow the students to start the sound and use the “ta-day” syllable.\n9.  Allow the students to start the sound and articulate by snapping your finger on\ncommand.\n10. With the metronome, begin to incorporate easy follow-the-leader rhythms with you\nsinging or modeling – and the students echoing on their headjoint.  Whole rests may\nor may not be necessary between you and the students.  As with your initial sound\nproduction exercises, students need to continue lightly tapping each beat on the end of\nthe headjoint while they are playing.  This ensures that students are thinking internal\nsubdivision.\n11. Before progressing to the fully-assembled flute, assign the following playing test on\nthe headjoint:\n•  Attach the headjoint to the body of the flute and begin articulation.  Students must be\nconstantly reminded that they should be articulating in the same way as they were when\njust using the headjoint.\n•  Whether students are playing white notes or black notes, they must constantly be\nreminded that the tongue moves down quickly.\n•  When students can successfully sing note names on the same pitch, allow them to\narticulate multiple notes on the same pitch.\n•  When pulse and foot pat are learned, students articulate every time their foot touches the\nfloor – and then when their foot touches the floor and as it comes up.\n•  Once the student is able to read music, call the articulation “rhythmic articulation.”\nStudents should be tonguing as the music moves across the page.\n•  Do not allow students to articulate back-to-back notes on different pitches until they are\nplaying with absolute connected style on notes of the same pitch.\n•  When the tongue is moving correctly, you must decide when it is appropriate to have\nstudents begin coordinating finger movement with articulation.\n•  When students articulate back-to-back notes on different pitches, they cannot stop their\nair as they change fingerings.\n•  Teach Mary Had a Little Lamb in four segments by singing and then playing:\n•  After all students have successfully played each segment of Mary Had a Little Lamb,\nbegin to string together the segments into the following finished product:\n•  Ultimately, students should be able to execute any or all of the following on a daily basis:\no  articulate as fast as they can\no  articulate using the “ta-day” syllable\no  articulate on command\no  articulate with foot pat and articulate rhythms\n•  When playing exercises out of the method book, you can return to previously-learned\nlines and add articulation.  Do not feel like all lines must be executed again during class;\nassign students to perform all lines at home with articulation."

    "text": "FLUTE CASES, IDENTIFYING AND REMOVING\nPARTS, ASSEMBLY, MAINTENANCE AND\nINSTRUMENT/BODY RATIO\nGeneral Information About All Woodwind Instrument Cases\n•  Most cases have distinguishing marks somewhere on the case.  Identify these\nmarks, and their relationship to the top and bottom of the case.  Most cases have\nthe handles placed on the bottom section of each case.  Check to make sure.\n•  Place all cases on the floor in front of the student, or on a large table in the correct\nposition.  Flute cases are more easily opened from the top of a large table.\n•  Be sure the student understands where each part of the instrument belongs in the\ncase.  Give detailed information on removing the parts from the case.  Make sure\nthe student waits for each instruction before performing the task.  Be sure the\nparts of the instruments are returned to the case in the reverse order they were\nremoved.\n•  All instruments must be assembled in a specific order.  Follow this procedure\nexplicitly every time.\n•  Never leave a closed case unlatched.  Most latches open from the bottom up, but\nthis is not always the case.  Sometimes buttons slide from side to side, etc.  Check\neach opening mechanism carefully before presenting the information to your\nstudents.\n•  Cases should be protected at all times.  Try to find a safe space in the classroom\nsetup for each student’s case.\nIdentifying and Removing Parts Safely From Its Case\n•  Once the case information is understood, place the case on a flat surface.  Never\nlet the student place the case in his lap.\n•  Open the case from its correct position.  Remember, most latches will lift up.\n•  Students must be taught to keep one hand on some part of the flute at all times.\n•  With the left hand, take the body out and lightly grasp the end with no keys\n(barrel).  Turn the body so the barrel is facing towards the left, and the G#/A-flat\n(“teardrop”) key is away from the student’s body.\n•  With the right hand, take out the foot joint and hold without touching any keys.\nTurn the foot joint so that the “roller” keys face the student’s body.\n•  Put the flute together with slight, twisting motions in an up-and-down fashion (as\nopposed to twisting from side-to-side).   Discourage students from using their\nknees as leverage while assembling the body and the foot joint.  If students have\ndifficulty, have them wipe off grit from the edges with any of their cloths or their\nbandana.\n•  To line up the flute, the rod of the foot joint must point to the center of the last\ncircular key on the body.  This may need to be adjusted for the size of the\nstudent’s right hand.  (Yamaha flutes have an arrow on both the head joint and the\nbody to help with aligning the flute; however, this is not the best way to line up\nthe body and the foot joint.)\n•  Hold the flute at the barrel with the left hand while gently resting it on the left\nknee (because the right foot should be the normal tapping foot).\n•  Pick up the head joint with the right hand and attach to the barrel.  Grasp the\nlonger end of the head joint.  Remove any moisture and/or grit off the exterior of\nthe end of the open end of head joint.\n•  Make sure the head joint is properly aligned with the rest of the flute so that the\ncenter of the embouchure hole is aligned to the circular keys of the body.  After\nfully assembled, support the bottom of the flute with the left hand, close one eye,\nand look down the flute as you would when looking through a telescope.\n•  SEND SEGMENTS OF THIS INFORMATION HOME TO PARENTS.\nCHOOSE THE INFORMATION YOU THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL\nFOR HOME PRACTICE AND INSTRUMENT CARE.\n•  Look at the case in relation to the parts of the flute.  Most cases are molded to the\nshape of a particular part.  Be specific when making this point to your students.\nTake your time, and repeat the information many times.  Notice that all circular\nkeys are toward the ceiling when placed correctly in the case.  Damage will occur\nif the parts are placed incorrectly in the case.\n•  The embouchure hole on the head joint must be facing the ceiling when placed\ncorrectly in the case.  The crown of the head joint must be facing the middle of\nthe case.\n•  Take the instrument apart in the exact opposite manner keeping your hands on the\npieces you are removing.\nInstrument Maintenance\n•  Students should use their silk swab or one of their cloths or bandana to wipe\nmoisture off the keys after use.  They should tie the bandana (if used) to the\nhandle—or wrap it around the cleaning rod inside the case.  The latter will\nprevent the cleaning rod from scratching any part of the flute.   No unnecessary\nobjects may be placed in the case at any time.  Only the parts of the flute should\nbe allowed in the case.  Students should not be allowed to use a fuzzy swab which\nstays inside the flute when in the case.\n•  The student should be given CLASS TIME to clean out his instrument, and store\nproperly in the case.  A textured cloth is great to remove grease or fingerprints\nfrom the flute.  Students can also wipe both the tops and in between the keys with\nthis cloth.\n•  Students need to clean the dust and moisture out of their flutes by using either the\ncleaning rod, a small/thin paintbrush or a small soft bristle brush used to apply\nmakeup.  Thread the cotton cloth through the eye of the cleaning rod.  Swab the\nbody and foot joint from both ends.  Do not force the cloth through either part.\nIf you choose to teach your students to swab out the head joint, they must be\ncareful and delicate when inserting the cleaning rod into the head joint.  Avoid\n•\nany movement of the cork, as this affects intonation later on.  (See additional\nhandout regarding adjusting the cork.)\n•  BE VERY SPECIFIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nInstrument/Body Ratio\n•  Familiarize the student with the instrument/body ratio by using the entire\nassembled flute…and also without the head joint.\n•  Move the instrument up and down, side to side and front to back by using the\nelbows.  The body playing position also holds true from previous information.\nWe are merely getting used to the weight of the instrument; the position of the\ninstrument; and the angle of the instrument without using correct hand position.\nThe student should not squeeze the instrument as these exercises are practiced.\nKeep the palms of the hands soft.\n•  The three balance points of the head joint only are the chin, the right and left hand\nthumb and two fingers used to properly hold the headjoint.\n•  The three balance points of the fully-assembled flute are the chin, the left hand\nindex finger (whose knuckle provides stability on the outside of the instrument)\nand the right hand thumb (which lifts and supports the flute).\n•  Familiarize the student in this manner for a few days before placing the fingers in\ntheir correct position.\nStorage of Head Joint (when allowed to be taken home by the students but not in the\nactual flute case)\n•  Have students bring a sock with some sort of indentifying feature or use an actual\nhead joint bag (either sold to students or hand-made by a seamstress).\n•  Socks should be kept in a box in the front of the classroom.\n•  Socks should only be taken out of the classroom by students after school.\n•  Socks should only be brought into the classroom prior to the start of school.\n•  Head joints should never be kept in backpacks, bookbags, pencil pouches, etc.\n•  Have some sort of accountability system in place when students leave their socks\n(head joints) overnight.  (cid:1)\n•  Be on the lookout for students coming into your classroom with socks (and later\nflute cases) which were kept in their lockers or gym lockers.  (cid:1)"

    "text": "BEGINNING FLUTE CLASSROOM AND\nENSEMBLE SET-UP\nBeginning Classroom Set-Up\n•  Your beginning flute class will most likely be the biggest beginner class and should\ntherefore be taught in the band hall!! Smaller ensemble rooms need to be reserved for the\nsaxophone, double reed, French horn and percussion classes.\n•  Configure your classroom based on how many students you have in the class.\n•  Start off the semester by putting students in alphabetical order so you can learn their\nnames faster.  Once music stands and mirrors are utilized in class, hanging name tags can\ncontinue to help you learn student names quicker. These can and should also be used on\nany days you have clinicians/consultants visit.\nTypes of Classroom Set-Ups\n1.  Arched set-up\n(cid:1)\nIf using your “ensemble set-up” for your class, have students sit in a “box,” so all\nstudents receive the same amount of attention/eye contact from you.\n(cid:1)  Have students sit in every other chair (if all chairs have to remain in your set-up\nthroughout the day).\n(cid:1)  The aisles between your rows must be large enough so that you will have quick and\neasy access to any student--both from the front and the back.\nIf you end up needing to use risers, make sure the backings are on them for safety\nreasons. If the risers do not come with backings, you can enlist the help of either a\nband dad or your woodshop teacher to install backings.\n(cid:1)  As much as possible, have students in “windows.”\n(cid:1)  You must be able to see each student from the front and the back.  With that said, you\nare not always able to correct student’s posture, hand position, etc. from the front of\nthe room; thus, you need to be walking around the room instead of “parking” on a\nstool!\n(cid:1)  Once you start determining playing ability levels of your students, place weaker\nplayers in the front of the classroom and stronger players in the back. Less attention is\ntypically given to players who are further back in the set-up.\n2.  Horseshoe set-up\n(cid:1)  This set-up is not recommended--why? Because you have a limited range of vision.\nIf you decide to use this set-up, you will need to pull the stand/podium far enough\nback in order to have clear vision of every student.\n3.  Arched with aisle\n(cid:1)  This is a very acceptable set-up, even with full ensembles.\n4.  Straight line set-up\n(cid:1)  These should only be used with bigger facilities.\nIn order for you to have visual contact with all of the students, the students on the\nends of the rows will have to adjust their chairs/ bodies towards you or you need to\nhave them sitting in a “box” (see arched set-up).\n5.  Straight line set-up with aisle\nAISLE\n6.  Circular set up\n(cid:1)  One teacher teaches from the inside and one from the periphery. Students face in\ntowards middle.\nIf you are teaching alone, it will be too hard to maneuver when teaching outside of\nthe circle.\n(cid:1)  This set-up is typical in elementary school cafeterias or small stage “cafetoriums”.\n7.  Have beginners only sit on left of your band set-up.\n(cid:1)  Flute players need to be on the same side of the ensemble as the French horn players\nbecause they are considered color instruments.\n(cid:1)  This is advantageous because they will be already sitting in the exact way they will sit\nin an ensemble for the next couple years – and in chairs that should already be spaced\nout\nFull Ensemble Set-Up\n(cid:1)  Again, flute players need to be on the same side of the ensemble as the French horn\nplayers because they are considered color instruments.\n(cid:1)  First chairs need to sit together so they can more easily balance and match in terms of\nbalance, pitch, etc. Remember, the flute sound does not come out of the foot\njoint……rather the tone holes.\n(cid:1)  Piccolo players need to be either on the 1st or 2nd rows—never on the 3rd row.\n(cid:1)  During the first few weeks (if not more) of each school year, it would be a great idea\nto sit 7th and 8th graders (or 2nd and 3rd year players) alternately so the younger/weaker\nplayers are surrounded—on both sides—by 8th grade/stronger/more experienced\nplayers.\n(cid:1)  Additionally, you will find that your younger/less experienced players will start to\nhear vibrato being used by an 8th grader (or 3rd year player) on one or both sides of\nthem, and will start to learn vibrato through “osmosis.”"

    "text": "FLUTE EXERCISES FOR GROUP SOUNDS\nGroup exercises—whether on the headjoint (“short instrument” or “baby instrument”) or\nthe fully-assembled flute—should be performed with the assumption that you have gone\naround the room as much as necessary before allowing students to make sounds on their\nown in this group setting.\nYou must make the decision as to when to allow short instruments to go home with your\nstudents.\nThe use of mirrors is imperative so students are consistent with everything they are doing.\nBreathing should already be introduced by this point.\nThe metronome should already be introduced by this point.\nFor exercises 1-6, articulation has not been taught at this time; therefore, “pooh” starts are\nused.  The tongue should remain naturally at the bottom of the mouth.\nRemind students to always be thinking pulse……as well as “start” and “stop” when\nappropriate.\nWhen appropriate for a specific exercise, audiation of note names with actual pitches is\nhighly recommended.\nHEADJOINT EXERCISES\n1.  Drill “ready position” and “playing/set position” DAILY.\na.  Call students to “ready position”….then to “playing/set position”….and back to\n“ready position”, etc.  For shorter/faster instructions, simply say “ready” and\n“set/playing.”\nb.  Repeat this over and over and over.\nc.  This teaches students how to set their short instruments.\nd.  Students must look at mirrors! DO NOT make them look at you.\n2.  Allow students to make sounds on their own.\na.  Students must exhibit good posture.\nb.  Students should be holding their short instrument correctly.\nc.  Students should be taking proper breaths.\nd.  You, the instructor, need to monitor students, both visually and audibly. DO NOT\nbury your head in your stand.\nFor all exercises that use the metronome, make sure students lightly tap their right hand\nfingers on the headjoint for keeping track of the beats.  Quarter note = 80 (with\nsubdivisions) is a good tempo to perform all exercises at.\n3.  With a model playing (or you if flute is your primary instrument)\na.  All students should be looking at the model, who should be standing directly\ncentered and in front of the class.  The instructor should be walking around the\nclassroom and monitoring students.\nb.   There should never be an overlap of sound between the model and the class;\nalways place a whole rest in between the model and the class.\nc.  Teach students the “start…stop” drill (using audiation).\nd.  The model and the entire class should breathe on beat 3 (when in 4/4/ time).\ne.  Sound the subdivision on the metronome at ALL TIMES. Start this at the very\nbeginning.  If students are having trouble, help them with their foot tap by putting\nyour foot on top of theirs.\nf.  During rests and while the model is playing, you must talk to students about the\nnecessity about staying completely set.  This will more quickly help students to\nlearn where exactly to place their short instrument.  The students should look so\nstill to the point they look like they are still playing!\ng.  The only embouchure movement that is allowed is for students that are having\ndifficulty making a sound…..and need to adjust something in order to achieve a\nsound.\n4.  Model, Student A, Model, Student B, Model, Student C, etc.\na.  Always place a whole rest in between the model and the student.\nb.  After every few students play, have the entire class play as a group.\nc.  The model should be walking around the room with the instructor, so that all\nstudents can more easily see the model’s embouchure, etc.\nd.  Depending on the size of your class, it is your decision to have students stay in\n“playing/set position” the entire time…..or instead allow students to be in\n“playing/set position” after every __ students.\n5.  Have all students stand and play one sound; if they do not get a sound for any reason,\nthey have to sit down.  (cid:1)\na.  The metronome is not used for this exercise.\nb.  Tell students that do not get sounds that they need to practice more at home!\nc.  Have some sort of incentive for those students who are still standing at the end of\none or more rotations.\n6.  Entire class—without a model—playing whole note, whole rest, etc… with the\nmetronome.\na.  Perform this type of exercise when you feel the class is ready\nb.  Before students play, have them audiate using “start”………stop.”\n7.  Entire class playing two articulated and connected whole notes followed by a whole rest,\nrepeat, etc.  At this point, articulation must have already been taught.\na.  Again, students can audiate the “start……..stop” drill.\nb.  Students are thinking “tu.”\n8.  Entire class playing two articulated and connected half notes followed by a whole rest,\nrepeat, etc.\na.  Again, students can audiate the “start……stop” drill.\nb.  All students are thinking “tu.”\n9.  The instructor or model performs random—yet not complicated rhythms, and the entire\nclass imitates (still with “pooh” … NO tongue).\na.  Perform these rhythms both with and without whole rests in between the\nmodel/instructor and the class.\nb.  It would be a good idea to incorporate rhythms—from the beginning band method\nbook used in your class—that have not yet been introduced.\n**EVERY CLASS FOR A FEW MONTHS OR SO MUST BEGIN WITH SOME SORT\nOF HEADJOINT EXERCISE!!!!**\nFULLY-ASSEMBLED FLUTE EXERCISES\n1.  The first note students should play is 3rd space C#/Db.\n•  This note can be played before teaching actual hand position.\nAt this point, hand position should already be taught.\n2.  Slur diatonic notes from third-space C down to middle C.\n•  For the very first note (third space C), students need to pull their top lip down over\ntheir top teeth and aim their air lower into the embouchure hole.\n•  There are three apertures on flute.  This particular exercise focuses on the lower\nregister, and therefore a more oval and straight across aperture is necessary for proper\ntone quality and resonance.\n3.  Teach students to play what are considered the “special” notes on flute.\n•  C♯/Db, C♮, B♮, A#/Bb\n•  For these notes (and later on an octave higher), students need to pull their top lip\ndown over their top teeth and aim their air lower into the embouchure hole.\n•  The tendencies of these “special” notes is for the tone to be airy, and the pitch to be\nsharp.\n•  By shaping the top lip and aiming the air down, the pitch will be lowered and it will\nhelp create a more resonant sound.\n•  C#/Db is THE sharpest note on the flute -- especially with a poor embouchure.\n•  You must talk the students through this process.  You should not be playing these\nnotes or demonstrating for them, unless flute is your primary instrument.\n4.  Lip push-up exercises\n•  Perform this exercise with a coffee stirrer.\n•  The goal is for the upper lip to maneuver the stirrer up and down\n•  Regarding students who are playing with apertures which are too large: remind them\nabout the size of the stirrer and relate that size to the size of their aperture.\n5.  Typical exercises you will see in most beginner method books\n•  Can be performed with or without articulation\n•  Changing notes; can be performed with or without articulation\n•  Progressive adding of more notes; can still be performed with or without\narticulation\n•  When you approach the first line in the book—which contains two or more back-\nto-back notes—these notes must obviously be articulated.  Therefore, you must\nhave already taught articulation with the proper syllable before these lines can be\nattempted.\n•  WHEN YOU TEACH ARTICULATION, YOU MUST FIRST INTRODUCE IT\nON THE HEADJOINT!!!"

    "text": "FLUTE EMBOUCHURE\n•  Students must be able to use air correctly before beginning to learn the flute\nembouchure.\n•  There should be no creases near the mouth or nose that are not naturally present.\n•  The corners of mouth should be soft, forward and away from the teeth, but moved\ntoward the canine/vampire teeth.\n•  There should be a “circle of air” behind the lips.\n•  There should be a “pocket of air” between the lips and teeth.\n•  The eyes remain soft and do not change.\n•  The lower lip should be soft and fleshy—very pouty.\n•  The corners should touch the lip plate.\n•  As much lower lip as possible should touch the lip plate.\n•  The wet part of the lips surround the air.\n•  Let the air blow the lips apart.\nLip and Teeth Formations To Avoid\n•  When the embouchure is formed, a teardrop occurs when the center of the top lip\ndoes not appear to be smooth from corner to corner.  This is often referred to as a\n“bud” or as having “Betty Boop” lips.  When the wet part of the top lip is smooth,\nthe teardrop may disappear, making the wet part of the lip smooth from corner to\ncorner.  If the teardrop does not disappear, the student’s aperture will form off\ncenter.  Be aware, however, that if a student plays off center, their lips will be\ntight on one side.\n•  When working with students with very full bottom lips, set the headjoint a bit\nhigher, and gradually pull it down as the student progresses.\n•  When working with students with thin bottom lips, place the lip plate lower on the\nwhite flesh and have the student roll their bottom lip out to simulate a fuller look.\n•  Students with very thin top lips should not be recruited to play the flute.  The top\nlip is critical to correct air direction and tone production.\n•  Students with crooked or crossed/overlapped front teeth should not be recruited to\nplay to the flute.\nStrengthening the Embouchure\n•  Place a coffee stirrer/straw on the wet part of the lips and have the student “grip”\nthe straw with the inside of their lips.  This helps students understand the strength\nof their lips and the size of their aperture.\n•  For apertures that are too large, have students perform lip “pushups” with their\nstraw.  The top lip should aim the straw (air) down.  Instruct students to make the\nwet part of their lips meet…….press…..relax…..press…relax…etc.  Have\nstudents watch their faces in the mirror as they do ten exercises, and then rest.\nUpper Cheek Inflation\nUpper cheek inflation occurs when there is air allowed in the cheeks while the corners\nblow away from the teeth.  While teaching this concept, you must carefully monitor\nstudents’ aperture sizes, as they may become too large.  Students can simply think of\n“little puffs of air” or “little circles of air.”  If you do not feel comfortable teaching this\nconcept, pay an experienced flutist to help your students.  Cheek inflation is a vital\ncomponent of the “finished” flute embouchure and will help create the most resonant\ntone quality.  This concept should be taught as soon as very mature and advanced sounds\nare being produced.  This is a very effective technique for both extreme lower and\nextreme higher register playing, and should be taught either by you or a professional."
