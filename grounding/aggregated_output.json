                "content": "Ensemble Director Refresh - July 25, 2024 VIEW RECORDING - 66 mins (No highlights) Meeting Overview In the session on connecting spring to fall curriculum, educators discussed innovative approaches to create a more cohesive and effective learning experience throughout the academic year. The focus shifted from disconnected units based solely on performance literature to overarching \"threads\" or \"strands\" of fundamental musical skills that span the entire year. This approach emphasizes active learning, with students demonstrating skills through application rather than passive instruction. To build student ownership and accountability, strategies such as short individual practice times during rehearsals, student-led warm-ups, and scrambled seating arrangements were proposed. The goal is to develop students' problem-solving abilities and musical independence. Implementation ideas include identifying core skill threads (like tone, articulation, and ensemble playing) that apply across all literature, incorporating structured \"chaos\" to boost engagement, using short timed practice sessions, and having students explain their practice strategies. By framing ensemble improvement in terms of individual contributions and accountability, educators aim to create a curriculum that goes beyond performance obligations, fosters musical independence, and prepares students to be mature, skilled performers after graduating. The key to this approach is consistently revisiting fundamental skills across all literature while gradually empowering students to take ownership of their musical development, providing flexibility in repertoire selection while systematically building transferable core abilities. Key Takeaways Instead of teaching in disconnected units based solely on performance literature, the group discussed having overarching \"threads\" or \"strands\" of fundamental musical skills (tone, articulation, ensemble playing, etc.) that span the entire academic year. These skill threads would be revisited consistently across any literature studied, providing a cohesive focus beyond just performance obligations. There was an emphasis on students actively demonstrating learning through the application of skills, not just being taught techniques by the teacher. Strategies were explored for giving students ownership, such as short individual practice times, having them lead warmups, scrambling seating, etc. This builds personal accountability. The group highlighted the difference between teaching techniques and actual learning when students can independently apply those techniques. A key goal was developing students' problem-solving ability as musicians, preparing them for independence after graduating from the music program. Topics Curriculum Threads/Strands The traditional approach of teaching disconnected units based on performance literature was challenged. Instead, the group advocated for identifying overarching \"threads\" or \"strands\" of fundamental musical skills that could connect all the literature studied throughout the year. These fundamental skills, such as tone production, articulation, ensemble playing, sight-reading, etc., apply to any piece of music. By consistently revisiting and developing these skills across all literature, students would build a strong musical foundation rather than just preparing separate concert programs. This thread-based approach provides more flexibility in choosing literature while systematically developing core abilities that transfer to any music. It gives the curriculum a cohesive focus beyond just performance obligations. Application of Learning Simply teaching techniques is not enough - students must have opportunities to actively apply those skills individually, away from the teacher's observation. This independent application demonstrates true learning has occurred beyond just being taught. Strategies were discussed for facilitating this, such as: Giving students short individual practice times during rehearsals to work on skills Having students lead warmup exercises Scrambling the ensemble's seating to create new listening environments This helps build students' personal accountability as musicians and problem-solving abilities since the teacher is not constantly watching over them. Challenges in Connecting Fall/Spring The educators shared the challenges they face in trying to connect the fall and spring semesters cohesively: Andrea (who is planning to submit for honor band) has to balance preparing very difficult UIL contest literature for the spring while still making time for more engaging/fun music for concerts. Ariana, coming from a band background, sometimes struggles to identify which fundamental string technique skills to prioritize teaching her orchestra students. The constant demands of performances can make it difficult to maintain a consistent focus on skill development throughout the year. Embracing Structured \"Chaos\" While rehearsals need structure, the group discussed the value of occasionally embracing productive \"chaos\" or freedom for students. This helps build relationships and empowers them to take ownership. Strategies included: Doing scrambled seating like a circle orchestra for a change of perspective Using timers to give short bursts of individual practice time during rehearsals Suggesting different practice strategies besides just straight repetition Allowing these less-structured environments gives students a break from constant teaching while still reinforcing skills. Next Steps Some key next steps were identified: Ariana will connect with an outgoing string faculty member for advice on fundamental technique skills to prioritize teaching orchestra students. Both will explore warm-up books and other resources for systematic technique development. They will implement short individual practice times within rehearsals, guiding students to use specific strategies. Moments of structured \"chaos,\" like circle seating, will be built into rehearsal plans to empower students. The goal is to develop independent, problem-solving musicians who can apply their skills beyond following the teacher's instructions. It is crucial to connect the fall and spring with consistent skill development threads. Transcript @7:15 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) But okay, done tap dancing. I think we've got everybody here that's going to be here today. So um, but what I was going to offer is, you know, I wasn't super happy with the quads that you got tried to get through on Tuesday and then like we ran out and time we ran over. So I changed the script a little bit today. There's not going to be a power point. going to be much more of a discussion based session in Ariana. know you probably doing bedtime kid things or dealing with kids at bedtime. @7:47 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) I'm actually on my walk because I haven't gotten to do that yet today. @7:52 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay, well, excellent. Well, feel free to chime in whenever. We are we're talking and you know, thing I wanted to talk about today. @8:00 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So @8:00 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) That again, I'm sorry. @8:00 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Were y'all talking about honor band? @8:03 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, we're just kind of doing the blow by blow Dawson high school one. @8:07 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) OK, in six, which, wow. @8:10 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, I mean, Aaron's going to have a year because he's doing Midwest. He's doing honor band. They're going to make state marching contest because of the area they're in. So he's going to need a bit of a sabbatical. @8:22 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) I think he should just take April and and may off and just kind of do his own thing. @8:27 - Andrea T. Maher Crazy. OK, cool. @8:30 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So yeah, it's a good time down here in Texas. @8:34 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Sounds like it. @8:35 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Um, but today what I wanted to talk about is kind of something I know we all do. I know we're all familiar with how this works. And so rather than be like, here's this new idea, I wanted to kind of talk through some of ways I think about it and then actually have a chance to kind of workshop some ideas and see what we think about this, this idea of curriculum as something that's not boring. Um, I don't know. if you're, when you came into the profession, if the vertical alignment thing was still a thing in professional development, I know when I started teaching in Keller and O2, that was like the thing you did in fine arts PD, if you weren't, if you actually got fine arts PD, you did vertical alignment between your middle school and high school and make sure everything all lines up, and it's not that, it's not what we're talking about today. That's so important, it's very tedious and has a lot of value, but is, again, tedious and not for doing things over Zoom. There's no refreshing about that. But the thing that keeps on coming to mind for me, and this has been something that's kind of rattled around my brain a lot and finally landed on something that I think I can call it a, like give it a name. And that is this idea of, we often think in units when we're teaching, like I have to do this thing till this date. And then I do this thing until this date. then we just kind of like look at all our performance obligations and auditions and things and work backwards, which is great because that lets us plan out a year. But there are things we miss if that's the only way we look at it. And it's unlikely that any one of us on this call only look at it that way, but there's a temptation, especially for younger teachers to look at it that way. And so, what I wanted to do is talk about kind of ways to think through the year or ways that I've thought of to think of through the year that might help one give y'all who are experiencing teachers more tools, but two younger teachers, they can get kind of caught in that getting slapped in the face every two weeks with something I need to do. This kind of gives them a thread to hang on to that at least in the midst of that, which is just part of a new job, they can still make forward progress on areas within what they want to cover. But before we get into that too deeply, but think about that. What are some things that come to mind for you about challenges that crop up when you're trying to maintain some sort of cohesive through line or some kind of central focus to your curriculum through an academic year? What are some things that are challenging about deploying the curriculum you want throughout your, you know, your hundred and eighty days in front of the kids? @11:30 - Andrea T. Maher Well, for me, this upcoming year is a triple C honor band year. And so, you know, I've already I've already been in contact with my clinician since May already looking at what's going to be our UIL program, whatever some possibilities, and then backtracking from there, like, okay, if I'm going to play this, what am I going to play at Christmas to help build skills into that? And to me, I mean, it's really great the way that works, but the downs side of that is there's no spring concert with like fun movie music and pop tunes and the end of the year like the musical reward for all this hard work like we go straight all the way to mid May 11th 15th with the same music the whole spring semester and and that's what we do but at the same time all the rest of the bands get to do the fun stuff the fun music and to make this hard lit this hard uil lit fun for the kids and fresh all the way from December one to the end of the year is is a challenge yeah I can imagine and you know with with that too like it's you can kind of paint it as like okay you're the top ensemble this is a cool thing we get to do nobody else has access to but it can be a grind I'm sure like what are you thinking through your program like what are some Considerations you have for what you're gonna play for that There's a piece called Helios on the great four lists that we're looking at and then we're trying to figure out What to put with it? We're actually gonna look at a grade three and see like maybe the old red mill or variations on Scarborough fair or something like that because in the past I've done a great five and and this year two really hard grade fours and It wasn't as successful as it needed to have men or should have been so You know trying to find that fine line of a program that's competitive, but also Really really good. It's got to be amazing. @13:44 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So It's a challenge Yeah, that would be a challenge and you know I think one of the things the honor band process does do like you said is it creates this kind of runway for you because you have to think back Through okay, this is the spring what I'm doing in the in the fall and have and that actually ties really well into what we're talking about today. But that's not to say that playing the same three pieces for an entire semester is not a stream on everyone, including the teacher. @14:13 - Andrea T. Maher So what about Ariana? Like, I'd be curious what your answer is being in Virginia. Like, what is that for you? @14:23 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So, for me, my big struggle, think, is that orchestra still isn't really my home base. So, sometimes they don't really know what I'm missing. If that makes sense, I don't know what are things that I should have done by now. last year, this past year was the first year I've had a group that shifted before they left me. Which I should be doing every year, but, you know, rebuilding after COVID has been really, really difficult. So that's one of those goals that I really need to hit. I need to be bigger on scales. But I think just trying to Trying to my, I'm still, I think it's a mix of not being familiar enough with literature and orchestra and general still, know, going on year six in middle school, but two of those years were COVID years. So not sure how much those count. And knowing how to push my kids, they're going to be by grade level. They're not necessarily by ability. Like when I was in middle school, we had a top band, a top eight period, a top seventh, and then a mix. And I just have a grade seventh grade and then beginners, beginners can be any grade level, which at least is nice. So trying to be better about understanding where where they are at the end of the year and how to catch them back up in August, doing that a little bit faster, I think, having a stronger plan of restarting so that I can be in a better place by winter. alignment's been really tough for me and I know that that's like he said it's not what we're doing but I really do like to the high school directors what do you need my kids to do that way I know what I need to have them ready for because again it says things that like as somebody who grew up playing oboe and studied to teach band originally I don't like I said I don't know what I'm missing so those are those big clues that I'm really looking for what do you need out of them so I can hopefully I can try to have them ready. @16:28 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Right and mean that's that's a struggle even if you do know the content area because you know like middle schoolers or middle schoolers you know they're consistently inconsistent but like how far can you push them and you know you ask them on a Texas for like well I mean they could play Dionysia actually tried real hard but you know at the same time is that right for your community is that right for your skill set like not every community is going to support the kind of time investment you need to place from those pieces and operate at that level right away and so you know, even your specific situation, Ariana, of thinking about like, okay, the high school is doing something and they're not great about communicating that maybe. But even if they are, like knowing how to connect the pieces from where it gets hard or where they need to be in an area that's still little unfamiliar and COVID kind of took two good years out of maybe three, I don't know how liberal Virginia was at that point. In Texas, took two weeks, it's fine. Pretty much, yeah. But the fact that we are, you know, still digging out of that and they're still kind of rebuilding the program is both an opportunity but also kind of an albatross. It's like you have that weight on your back of having to get that thing done. But yeah, both of these kind of topics I think will fit really well into what we're talking about today. So the very first thing I like to think about getting back to the study of units and things like that is, you know, we have obvious things we need to do in performing arts. have concerts. We have we have, you know, kind of this milieu of stuff that ends up on our calendar and we work backwards from there because we really want to do well in those situations. And that's good. But often younger teachers can turn into like months of the week like, okay, what do we need to fix today? Rather than like, okay, we're working on this long term thing. So rather than units, I like to think about threads or strands that run through my year. Where for instance, know, the second band or the third band or, you know, really any ensemble, but I'm thinking, you know, an ensemble where skill development is still very much a you can tangibly see it improve. The thing I like to think about there is, okay, what are our fundamental skills? What are the things we're doing that I can connect across anything we're playing and how am I setting those up to be successful? So for instance, let's say I'm teaching that that in varsity middle school band. So we're, you know, looking at a grade two grade ones, I think is the minimum. and for triple C, right? Or grade one, grade two, is kind of where people end up. By the time I left, brings up where I ended up, and they've since improved dramatically from there, probably because I'm gone. But the thing that I thought about there always was, okay, so we're playing this music, great. And we play kind of the stuff we can play at beginning of the year, that's dance of the C scale, cheer one, pretty straightforward stuff. by the end of the year, we're doing stuff with maybe two independent motives. And, you know, like, great locomotive chase might be like the big thing. And now that's actually was a stretch for my kids, but that's neither here nor there. But using the skills that are required in those pieces, the very, very most basic skills, playing with a good sound, and with good articulation, playing with good line, playing with good musical thinking, now become threads that I just go, okay, where are we at on this scale in this piece? Because this piece is always gonna need to get better, and the skills always need to get better. But that skill is always going to be there. It applies to any piece we play. And so all of sudden, instead of going, how do I make this piece better, I go, how can I make this skill better that we'll make this piece better? So I kind of change the priority there. Which, again, we as experienced teachers do something like that probably more often than we don't. You know, if we have space in our schedule, or if it's acceptable in our area to do some sort of fundamental skill building section of our rehearsal, like, you know, daily drill down here in Texas, we work on stuff like that. That's a very intentional part of what we do. And I think in in string circles, generally, it's not something that happens as often, but the language is not foreign, which I think is really interesting. So, you know, one of the things they talk about is, you know, the beauty of sound, and how musical something is like, okay, that's great. But we got to do this all together and go, oh, And a lot of times, if you can walk them through why we're spending time playing, you know, on open note or working on bow control, or, you know, frog tip to frog, all that stuff, suddenly it becomes like, oh, I see what you're doing. This is, you know, this is a skill building. Great. Fine. Whatever. And, you know, there's lots of things to cover in there in terms of how that manifests and like using the metronome and stuff like that. But I think thinking about this idea of threads or strands that run through our year can be a really freeing thing in terms of what are we doing at a given day, but also how we look at the whole year. So, you know, it's that Christmas concert is Christmas concert or winter concert or whatever we want to call it. But it is a chance for us to work on specific skills that we know we need to be at a high level in later semester, like in spring semester for while or things like that or for contest or whatever it is. And then that's really the main focus. Music is the music. It's not a material that kids like that they really want, but like we can be a little bit more fun. free as long as it satisfies certain criteria we have for getting better at the things that we need to get better at. And that's up to us to decide. we'll talk that through in workshoping these ideas. But the other aspect that I think is really interesting is if you think about planting gardens, because everything's growing right now, because we're getting interested in constantly. And so like thinking about this idea of like if you look at like the countryside from the air, like not Texas, but like places where they actually grow lots of crops. You see kind of the squares or sometimes circles, but you see this very boxed out like this is sort of and this is wheat and this is corn. But then we also know because we've been in the woods, we've walked around that most of nature doesn't really grow that way. That's kind of something we impose as humans. And a lot of times they just grow wherever they kind of this like vines or if you want to think of like kudzu, like just kind of growing wherever it wants to, are teaching the things we have to teach to get the job done. to perform at the concert, to get the kids to audition, to do all the things. That's very much like the units or those crops. It's very like, here's Wordstarts, here's Wordstops. all this thing in between. But the ideas that we teach, the core of what it is to be musical in our ensembles, and I mean that to be income is everything, not just playing with that name, but like playing with a good sound and communicating musical information through some sort of group consensus, that's much more like a vine. That's much more like that kazoo, that just kind of grows wherever it wants to, and it can be a thread that connects everything, too. And so that, to me, is where it's good to start thinking about this, and even just re-articulating what we want to do in those new words can sometimes shake some things loose. So one of the things maybe I'd like to do is kind of take an aspect of what you're thinking about. Take one small slice, and see if you can apply something, like this would be a connecting thread that leads me back to. to August or September or whatever you start playing. So kind of take a second to think about that. So I'll share mine because it's not, I don't have the chance to teach an ensemble, which I wish I could, Cameron and David do a pretty darn good job. So I'm not really needed. But that said, I do think a lot about this in terms of I teach a two semester course. I teach like a junior high version and a high school version of how to be a band director. And this semester, how to be an orchestra director. And so a couple of the through ones I think about there, like the big one I'm thinking about now is critical thinking without calling it critical thinking. Like how do I get the students to listen to or recording or listen to performance and not just go, wow, needs to be louder or quieter. actually think deeper than dynamic changes or the way they may listen to a symphony concert and think down deeper of like okay what skills are they demonstrating they can do well? What are skills they are kind of like some kids are there and what are skills like nobody has a really good feel for and so they can start to then take that and go here are things that work here are things that need little attention here are things that are a five alarm firing we need to think about and that's the thread I'm trying to draw through everything so that I'm drawing their attention to that skill of assessing and thinking through student performance in as many different ways as I can without it becoming overwhelming so for like middle school classes for the musical focus classes we do a little bit with ensemble what we do a lot with like individual beginner sounds or individual instruction like you would in front of a homogenous beginner class which Ariana I know does not set them up to work outside of Texas but it's those are the cards we're dealt but like in the high school we do a lot more listening to ensembles and I have a collection of ensemble recordings. from not Texas. I won't say where they're from, but they're from not Texas. One, because that way they don't know. And two, ensemble, some of them are like, they can do the ensemble thing pretty well, but there are some very obvious gaps in the way they approach things, and that's, that's fine. That's where those groups come from. But then we transition to like the YouTube postings that people do of their pre YLs, and we pull up like Henry Middle School, like we pull up kind of your more standard, like here's a second band at a double C that's in a pretty far suburb of this major city. They suddenly have, I hope, a lot more tools to apply to that, that even though the ensemble sounds significantly better than what they're, they've been listening to, they still can go, oh, I hear that thing in a way that will unlock for them as a teacher the ability to go, oh, I hear that here's how I'm going to go about fixing it. So that's kind of how I'm thinking about threading in my microfilm and my course. What about y'all? @27:00 - Andrea T. Maher One of the, one of the big overlying threads for us is, you know, our kids start in fifth grade and we have schools that are fifth and sixth grade only and they only have, well it's Ted Regina's. They only have woodwind class, brass class, and percussion class. And they only get together for a concert so they may only have a couple of rehearsals before a performance. And so when they come to us, then they have the complete opposite. They have full van every day. They never break up until woodwinds brass or percussion unless we have sectionals. So our, so in a lot of ways we say we have to teach them how to do band because they don't know how to be in such a large group of students. They don't know how to react. They don't know how to rehearse in such a big setting of 65 kids and then teach the ensemble skills that they've never been taught. But at the same time, I still have to develop their individual skills. So it's a, that thread of teaching them how to be a band and to be a band member all the way through the year. is kind of a central idea for all our groups and how do you like what are some ways you kind of deploy that idea of like how to be a band uh some I mean basic we start off the years just like get to know your neighbor because they come from four different schools and so they all come together from and I'll think that some of them know each other some of them don't know anybody in the room so just get to know your section who sits next to you what's their name um and that starts us into we'll let's listen to your person next to your trio and then okay now you know their names like don't play louder than Joe Smith you know so kind of we do that first just getting them to know each other and stuff like that to kind of build that and then we can build from there but it's an interesting process it's very different you know than a lot of places that start their own beginners in sixth grade and and you know all the ways sixth grade one con rose kind of singular in that organization like @29:00 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Asadina does something similar to that, I think, where it's five, six, then a seven, eight. But again, the scale difference between Pasadena and Conro is pretty substantial, just in terms of the physical size of the district, to speak of the size of the programs. that idea of getting someone else's things and having to work with it, I think that's a really good thing to start with, though, is this idea of how do we work together as an ensemble? And one of the things that's come up in my research that's related to this, but not specifically about, like, pedagogy, that bands are some of the only organizations that are the size that they are, that are perpetually refreshing. like, choirs can get really big, but a lot of times if they're not a tattoo sent to the orchestra, they're gonna be a professional group, and then that's really about it. But, like, bands, especially when you look at bands the size of the ones we have here in Texas, they're six, eight groups that have three or four hundred kids in them. The only thing that they, that's not a band, because bands, like, this all over the world, but the only thing that's not that, that isn't a band that's that big is like a samba school in Brazil. A lot of other places, music is done at a much smaller scale, it's much more like maybe 10 to 12 people, or a game like 24 to 20 to 30, but still it's not hundreds of people that have to do the same together. So this idea of how do we operate as a social unit and how do we kind of react? I love that you said they don't know how to react because it might break up just seeing how middle schoolers react when they don't matter react, and that is every way under the sun, sometimes not in a helpful way, more often than not in a helpful way. And so like I love that you start with that and that's really cool. And it obviously shows up in what they do by the end of the year and what they do when they get to high school. So that's fantastic. Ariana, how about you? @30:51 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So I love that she brought that up because one of my goals as I grow the program is to eventually have, you know, sixth grade is what it is. And then I'm afraid to have a high strings and a low strings class and then eighth grade the ensemble group. that way they're kind of, I mean, I understand that yes, sixth grade is an ensemble, but not really. But that would give me that is something that I see the band directors here do is that, you know, they didn't get that time to address a lot of those like woodwind specific things because they were teaching an entire beginning band of one block. So they use seventh grade band to kind of help. They split to help make up for the deficiency. But my really strong point this year is was really funny that you mentioned it warm ups. Like that is what I'm really going after because that's been kind of a battle for me is like, I grew up on the blue book. I remember when I had to buy a new copy and I saw that one of the authors died I was reading the back I was like oh my god what like I still have my original copy from the Jackson middle school band in 1997. But I think I bought a euphonium copy for personally. And I was like, oh my gosh. And so to me, like, obviously out of the band game for quite a while, but like, you have to warm up. And I've noticed it was for orchestra that's very split. Some people are like, no, you just start playing whatever. And then like you had mentioned, there's a lot of technique work to be done. And again, as somebody who does not necessarily have those techniques or doesn't think about them because I wasn't taught them, I just had to learn them a week before my students. So I thought a cart was going to learn me, sorry. So I've been really struggling with that because so many people are like, oh, I just take it out of our music and I turn something into a warm up that day. I'm like, that's great. I don't have the mental capacity for that. I've got eight classes that I'm teaching, three different courses, plus three levels of orchestra, like, I can't do that. And so now I have a cart coming, There we go. So I've been looking at for a warm up book because then at that point we're like, I need somebody to tell me what to do. I was like, I just, I need, I don't need an idea. I just need it written out. And so that's something I'm looking to start this year. And I'm hoping will be that kind of kickstart refreshers just to really have, here's what we're going to do today. Here's how we remember how to do this and maybe tackle things that I didn't even think about that I'm always like, guys, we really got to work on using our whole boat there. What does that mean? Well, we know what that means, but have we done that in contact? Have I ever stopped to work on that? Have I started a class like that? Probably not, because it's all chaos. And so my brain, I feel like with that shift, because I shifted the COVID year, that was the year that we were, I was doing chorus and band, or chorus and orchestra at the same time. Two different classrooms, buildings. And then, you know, we will help for spring break and everything back. And so I don't think I ever fully got to like grasp how to start class, which feels so dumb saying that like that was like my ninth year teaching, I think eighth year teaching, like I should have known what I was doing at that point. But because it was something different and it was something that was really complex doing both at once, it just never clicked. And so I feel like I've almost failed my students in some ways because of that, because of my lack of knowledge, my kids can play rhythm all day long. They're great sight readers, they can play rhythm, they're fantastic, but they're missing some of that technique work. so I was just planning that you had mentioned that because that's really like what I'm looking to really attack this year is if I can start that, every day as we go from 80 minute classes to 50 minute classes now, they're still every other day, right? You know, what can I do that can make that 50 minutes now, so that 80 minutes, even more impactful. What can I do that's going to last even longer in a shorter amount of time? @35:05 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, and I mean, that's the, the ever other day is challenging. It's even more challenging when you have ever other day for what would be a normal class period, the 50 minutes rather than like an hour and a half or, you know, some other schools get. Um, so I mean, that, that in and of itself is challenging. And I wouldn't be too harsh on yourself. I think any of us who are teachers look back on our teaching of X years ago, well, I really didn't do the best for my students there. Like I could have been better and, you know, we're all where we are and we meet the challenges we meet with the tools we have. And as long as we're trying to get better tools, I think we're doing the right things. Um, so, so be gentle with yourself, especially, especially since you were spinning so many plates and then COVID added to the Luby's order, which that's a part. Um, they don't want to have the Luby's by UH though, just, just so everyone's gone. @35:58 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) It is gone. @35:59 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) It is gone. lot that who knows what will be built, hopefully something exciting or at least useful. So, but thinking about fundamental skills, about warm-ups and this idea and like, you grew up, you grew up in Texas, right? @36:15 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Yeah. @36:17 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) like, you you kind of know the the the Kool-Aid we don't bring down here about like what warm-up to and how they function. And being around U of H, like, we take it to a ridiculous extent sometimes. I still remember watching Tom Bennett rehearse the Wind Ensemble when they were preparing for TMA in 2005. And like, it was the first year player would play an interval up and an interval down within articulation and everybody else had to figure out what the articulation was, like what the rhythm was, but also what the intervals were and they weren't the same, it wasn't didn't mirror itself. So, like, yeah, we can we can go all day long and play some Sundays thinking about fundamentals at U of H and personally that is where my happiness lies, but at the same time that tool of thinking about fundamental skills. So like, this is where I think maybe it might be good not to wait on the high school people to tell you what they want. Instead, go, what does it look like they do? Like, what are some things that make sense there and just start with that as kind of a proximal goal? But then also, and I'll send you an email, I'll connect you to email area to our outgoing string person. ACTION ITEM: Connect Ariana with Aaron Hansen, a former U of H orchestra director, to discuss teaching orchestra outside of Texas - WATCH @37:22 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) She's moving up to Illinois. @37:25 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Her name's Aaron Hansen. She's got a lot of great information, especially about teaching not in Texas. @37:30 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Like, she's done in Michigan for a long time. That would be awesome, thank you. @37:33 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) That's probably a more supportive sort of setup than what you're describing. But at the same time, it's heterogeneous versus homogenous. It's not every day. you've got all these different things. And she's very sensitive to people who are not orchestra people operating in the orchestra space in terms of that they need a little bit more support. @37:53 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So I'll connect you to get email. @37:55 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) But to me, what you have the opportunity to do is one, make the warm up something that is going to build that skill, obviously, but to make it something where, especially as you mentioned, like, you've kind of got a bit of chaos, embrace the chaos a little bit, let it break little but give the kids jobs within that. And, you know, maybe you don't have a ton of great student leaders, but maybe you have a few and maybe make them, okay, you go in this corner, you go in this corner, have no idea how big your room is, but like, segment them out and go, okay, we're going to do the first three minutes is getting things together and setting ourselves up. then the next seven is going to be these three exercises, Bob, you're going to lead that one, Julie, going to lead that one, you know, SMA, going to lead that one. And you just have them do a little like round robin and all of sudden, don't have to work on the skill necessarily. You don't have to be directly responsible for they're doing, you're responsible for going around and monitoring and being like, how's how's that going? And then you can kind of bring them all back together. We're fine a little bit if you need to then move on to do the next thing and maybe maybe maybe like peak days where it's like Okay, it's Tuesday. We're gonna do this thing and Thursday. We'll do this or whatever your a day B day looks like Because that all the sudden empowers the kids to that gives them a little bit in what they're doing and We know that kids are like brutal with each other in terms of their evaluation of others They might not say it sometimes they do in middle school But they have years they can hear things and they can hear when things are right and when things are wrong and the more we empower them to Not just have those opinions, but do something with them. The more we start to build their internal musicianship. @39:38 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) I think right. @39:40 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I like them That and I mean play around with that like make it super simple at first make it like hold this note still for acts or like frog to tip Over eight counts at whatever tempo marking works or strings So like you know stuff that stuff that they can get easy wins, right? And then you can start moving in to technique and doing the things like here's how we shift the third position that we do this thing and then maybe even segment them by the three instrument families. If you're in trouble club go here, you're in altar club go here and if you're in place club go here and if you're a viola and can't read altar club just go cry because that's really all you can do. @40:19 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Or you're me. @40:22 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I moveable clefs make me, I taught high school in the bassoon or trombone A2 to go into this I'd write letters then. I was ashamed. @40:32 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) They laugh at me. I'm like okay hang on CB. Okay this is an E or usually it's like the violin two-line. It's a little weird. But I will say something that's like a happy accident that I discovered I got a doctor beat last year. probably one of the only orchestra people with one but you know it's okay and accidentally switching it to like the beats not like not the straight quarters but you know it has like those rhythms that it'll play. Oh yeah. Yeah. And so, like, I would actually do that. Sometimes I'd be like, all right, do scale, let's go. And just doing their scales to whatever, you know, popped up on the Dr. B and they're like, Oh, okay, I can do this. I can do this. @41:14 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Evan, if you can find the tempo, and this is probably something you can do if it's like music that is danceable, look for the BPM and get a karaoke track of like something that's popular, this school of program, which that makes it hard. But like, hot to go, maybe is not what you want to do with them, but things like that. And put that as the backing track for playing scales. If you're worried about just technique and all you want to do is focus on that. when you're focused on quality of sound, take that away and go, okay, let's do this half tempo and really focus on it, feeling the same. But the sound being the thing we're doing and then speed it back up and do that thing. But like, I mean, the fact that you have a Dr. B means that your kids are probably a lot more accurate in ensemble settings than others because they're more aware of that thing. @41:58 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Right, because they hear it a lot. They're like, can you turn it off? @42:02 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) No. @42:02 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Not yet. No, not. @42:04 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) No, no. But I mean, and that's another thing too, though, like, and this is something we talk about in my undergraduate classes, but it's something I've talked about for a long time, because not being in Texas, I had to defend the metronome a lot. I had to be like, this is why we use it, and this is what we do with it, because people out, you know, in the broader world, and you've experienced it. know right now, maybe you have to, Andrea, the Texas is a musical conversation or the kids are robots conversation often centers back to what you have that metronome going the entire time. It's like, okay, you know what, if we're using the metronome 100% of the rehearsal and it's the day before the concert, yeah, we screwed up as teachers, right? But how else are the kids going to learn steady time, except through a metronome? Not to say anything of playing together as a group or understanding subdivisions of the beat, steady time does not something that we as humans do very well, just cool as a crowd clap when the fight song happens at a football game, like it's everywhere. And so, you know, thinking about that, though, the thing that that kind of has come to my mind is that, like, the, the metronome is a scaffold. If we want to think about educational terminology, or I also, we're just training wheels. You you need them for a while. And, and at some point, with the metronome, it's not training wheels because you need it to kind of give you a reference, but then it goes away. @43:21 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) You don't need it as much. @43:22 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) so, we as teachers need to have a plan for okay, here's not just how we're going to take out the metronome, like it's marching band. Like, okay, here's the first movement, no metronome. it's going to be, here's how I want to build their skill with the metronome, so that it's not that they don't need it. that it's already inside of them and they don't have function without the audible click-track thing. And, you know, I think that is something that maybe, I know I lost sight of as band director sometimes, when I was teaching, especially teaching the lower skill level groups, the groups that kind of need a little bit more loving care and the ones that maybe don't necessarily want to practice all the time. Um, you know, like it's a temptation turn a metronome and go and the more I didn't do that, more I was very intentional about when we took it away and making them do things on their own, like training wheels, the stronger those kids got. Sometimes they would, you know, jump up to the first band, sometimes they'd jump up to the second band, but we always started every semester with a conversation of, okay, this is the concert band and we have two other bands and you have to audition into those. My goal here is that you're not in this band next semester. You're not in this band next year. I want to see you move up. I want to see you have those experiences too. And you know, I would say probably 60% of them did, which for a community like Waller, where we didn't have access to a lot of private lesson teachers was not a bad thing and the band's got better. So, but this idea that you mentioned, Ariana, of thinking about like the metronome is kind of being a weird thing. I sparked that because again, that's another thread that we can pull on, of how to play as an ensemble because it's a related skill, but it's a different skill than playing by ourselves. And I think that's something maybe to keep in mind to, given both of you or middle school teachers, and it's something that's present in your mind, because you know, these kids don't know what they don't know when it comes to being in an ensemble. know they're sitting next to somebody, but what to do with that information is not intuitive. It's very much a learned process. ACTION ITEM: Implement new activities like fundamental technique exercises, circle orchestra, and scrambled seating to address skill gaps, boost technique, and improve morale and engagement. - WATCH And so kudos for both of you for kind of making that a priority early in your year. @45:23 - Andrea T. Maher Well, I think Ariana, I think you have more to draw than you in of like organizing your class. think, you know, you can still like steal from the band world where, you know, we do like 10 minutes of warm up, 10 minutes of technique, and then the rest music or some version of that. And you did that all your band life. And I think you can bring that to your orchestra class or if you ever had to do choir again, you can still use that same organization to your time. @45:54 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) And I think you have more skills than you give yourself credit for. Yeah, it's actually when in terms of how to structure the learning and I think that's that's a really key thing that we all need to embrace when we run into situations that are maybe novel. @46:12 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Well, thank you. Yeah, I think I let myself get overwhelmed a couple of years ago. Since I was just taking my beginners to assessment and I've refused. Which is a different conversation. But so we had a clinician come in instead and she was like first thing like you are an orchestra person. Stop saying you're a band person. was like, yes, ma'am. She's like, you are doing so many things. Well, and I think I just kind of. Because I'm such a perfectionist probably coming out of a Texas band program, you know, like. I had to be a perfectionist. There was no choice. There was there was no option. And so I think I kind of let myself get mentally overwhelmed with, like I said, what I don't know. Instead of being like, I do know how. to do this part of it, let's go. And while we're doing that part, let me fill in the gaps that I don't know and add it, you know. @47:07 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So I think we're all that place. Imposter syndrome is not something that only the other person has in the conversation. I can promise you that it is we are all dealing with variants of that. And I think you set this up really well, Ariana, because the kind of next thing on my list of things to talk about was this idea that was kind of made me like squint my eyes and have to really think for little bit, but then it's like, oh, okay, is that within all of this, when we're talking about instructional design and like where things happen and how to connect with pieces, there is a difference between teaching and learning. Because if we think about what a good classroom looks like, like you mentioned Ariana, this kind of chaos, like when we think of the ideal classroom, we're often thinking about it's quiet because they're attentive, they're making I contact their engage with something. And all those are kind of external markers of learning. But we also know for experience that those are always not internal. We're reflected internally. You know, even if they're like doing the thing, it's like they might be thinking about who knows what. probably don't want to know what they're thinking about especially in middle school. But this idea that there is a difference, they're related. And we often think one leads to the next without really having to, you know, make any further steps. But there is a difference between us teaching and the students learning. And sometimes that difference is in the way that they interact with the material. So for instance, you know, one of the things we know is that the learning modalities, the visuals and oral and kinesthetic learners is kind of not 100% accurate. Like it's everybody's got, you know, variations of that. It's not quite as clear cut as they made it back when they talked about that. But the way students tend to learn best in. and arts settings, especially performing arts, is by doing things. And so the repetition count is high. But then we go, well, what if they're doing it wrong? we're repeating mistakes, basically. so building a way that we can do the teaching, but then have a really, really, really, really, really short window or short time span before we can start assessing is the learning happening. Because the only way we know learning is happening is by what they demonstrate. And the only way we know that really robust learning is happening, really stuff that's going to last beyond that day is having them do it when they don't think about it directly. Like, they're just kind of the natural fallback. Like, we think about a kid, and you see that kid pick their instrument. And you can tell before they make a sound, kind of where they're out on their journey. Like, if they're, like, of pointing everywhere and they're a mess and they can't sit still, you kind of don't expect them to come in and sound like Chris Martin. But they pick up their trumpet. It's very intentional. And they set themselves up, if they make a sound that's more like Chris Martin, you're going to be a lot less surprised. And so that idea of the learning being their demonstration of the skill away from the kind of us like looking at them daggers in our eyes is a thing that we want to try and get to as quickly as possible, I think, as far as being teachers. And so, you know, assessment piece, we always do formative assessment, we're always listening to kids. But then when we have them, this kind of gets to what we're talking about with you, Ariana, is, you know, when they do things, whether it's really isolated skills or application, both skills to something in technique or application of all that music, how often are we letting them go, do the thing, try different ways, kind of learn like, you know, pre-ranked chickens, and then come back together to see if the skill got better, like, how often are we doing that? the answer is not often at all, maybe explore that, because that might be a way one, the kids get a problem. break. You know, they only want to listen to us for so long. But two, it gives them a little bit more freedom at a time in which middle schoolers love. They love to feel like big kid. mean, an eight-year-old who might as well be in middle school because she likes to feel like a big kid so much. And all of that stuff suddenly becomes less about the classroom looking a certain way and more about the actual product we get because of the way we let our classroom operate. I mean, does that like scare you this thing? Because it scared me when I first ran, like, I don't know if I am willing to give up that kind of control to the kids. Or does it strike you as like, oh, already do something like that. @51:43 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) This is what it is. Go ahead, Ariana. Sorry. Oh, I was going to say I do every now and then I'll do stuff like that. Or maybe as an ensemble, try something one way and then we'll try another way and another way and we'll kind of like let the class come to a consensus about it. But I've never- usually if I let them scatter to work on something, it just ends up being social hour. So I kind of give up on that. So I don't know if I need to be more directed, if I need to move around more when that happens, because I like the idea, which is why I keep trying it. It just doesn't typically work in my setting, which means I'm not setting it up correctly. @52:25 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Well, or it's just there are certain challenges you might face given the kids you have in that room. @52:33 - Andrea T. Maher Well, and like I've done this this was the first shoot that I've kind of done this. You know, we play through a scale and it sounds terrible as a full band. So I'll say practice that on your own for like 15 seconds and we're gonna try it again. I like practice on your own. And they do. They sit because I only give them 10 or 15 seconds and they'll practice that scale and we'll play it again and it'll be maybe this much better. But it did get a little better or sometimes if we go through a technical passage and eat. and that we're playing a real slow. I'll just let them practice on their own, but only like 10 or 15 seconds, because any more than that, then you might get Careless Whisper or the Haysong or something like that. So I've done that. I probably did it a little more than I probably should have this year, but like you said, it gives the kids a break. And they're gonna do it anyway. You know, if we play a scale and it's terrible, they want to play it on their own. And they'll try it. So like, oh, we're just gonna buy into it. And so we did that a few times and it seemed to work because I did it only for a short amount of time. Today I was in a clinic and they said something like, like Ariana, you were saying like, sometimes when you have kind of a crazy day, the David Puckett and Richard Alvarado said, embrace it and make that the one day you have, you know, sit by your friend day and everybody scatters and sits in a different place in your orchestra room. and we do circle orchestra. Everybody makes the big giant circle and play. he said, you know, that one day, you know, the kids will remember the fun of that one day and it'll, it'll pay you more dividends in morale because you embraced the chaos and you just went with it that one day. And, you know, he's like, make it better. @54:21 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You may not, but the kids will remember when they did circle orchestra or when they got to sit by their friends. @54:27 - Andrea T. Maher And so sometimes if it's too chaotic, like just immersive. @54:31 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) That is actually something like all throw timers. I use classroom screen a lot. @54:36 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) don't know you know that. @54:38 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) But since we're supposed to have our learning targets posted, then I didn't have like a rotating set of things or I'll have that on one screen, classroom screen on the other. But I'll set like 15 minute timers. Okay, we have 15 minutes for this piece. Find a new place to sit, go and we'll rehearse for 15 minutes. We'll, you know, address whatever new issues pop up because suddenly we're not coming with our section. And we can't hear that part. so, oh, it didn't go right. Let's talk about that. OK, minutes is up. Next piece by Denise Clothosico. And that's something that the kids really, really do like. So yes, I do love the whole historical playing or the scrambled seating. @55:15 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) That's all I've been And I think that gets us something that one of our graduate students who does a lot of presenting talks about where it's not so much about the pedagogy of what you're teaching and the technique. It's more about paying into the relationship bank with the kids as an ensemble. I see you. It's a crazy day. You're in middle school. You're crazy to begin with. Let's lean into that today. As long as we get some very basic things done, we're good. And I will make this as fun as possible. But then tomorrow, you have to come in and we're back to kind of doing things a different way. And so that it's not always the same flavor of ice cream. So I love that too. And one of the things I always did was talk about, OK, want you to do this five times. Five times. And then put your instrument up. And when everyone's instrument is down, I know we're ready to go, and you know, social pressure works on that, but they even within us, okay, in those five times, what were some different ways you did work on that thing? techniques, what strategies did you use? And like, I taught high school kids for the majority of my career, so you could talk about things in that kind of abstract way, but even like with little kids like, hey, did you play or working on scales? Did you play the mini scales? Did you play mini scale? Like the first five notes, and then the next five notes, and then put those two things together, like the two added monster on Sesame Street, and some of them are like, no, I don't need that, but some of them like, oh, oh, I forgot about that. That was in sixth grade. Oh yeah, and all of sudden they have this tool that they're going to use again, or hey, did you play that at Hack Tempo, or did you play that like in, you know, for the kids to get really bored, the ADD talented kids like, did you swing that? Did you, you know, did you play it like little two note groups and do your thing or, you know, whatever it is, or like the kids like, I played the the Arbon A2, or I played the Clark Study, so I gave you that. I'm glad you did that. You know, because then all of sudden, it's not just repetition for the kids that are paying attention. It's, oh, there are ways I can practice this that make the practicing improve me faster, you know, rather than just play it five times. And then we're done. It's like, well, it's going to get a little bit better. You get better doing the thing. But the more we can build these awarenesses in, like, oh, if I'm having trouble with this kind of thing, here are some tools I have. And not every kid's going to remember all of them, but if they're exposed to them, they stand a better chance than if we don't talk about them at all. And they're probably not learning them anywhere else. And so, like, to me, that becomes a really valuable part of, again, if we're talking about building skills over time, how do I approach this as an individual musician? And how do I bring that to the ensemble? I mean, that's level one level two listening within what Mr. talks about, but he's not the only one that talked about that. He just gave it names. So we tend to point to him first. But within all of that, too, I think that the way we think about ensemble. in terms of an individual's contribution to it, frames a lot of that. If it's, that's got to sound better and we don't talk to the individual, all of a sudden we're reinforcing, well, part might or might not matter and if I get it right fine, but as long as it sounds good overall, gonna be all right rather than, hey, we need everybody to be on the same level here. go practice that, be able to play it perfectly twice and then put your instrument down and like make it something they can do. But yeah, I definitely agree with Andrea that the time aspect of it is like, okay, you can do that for this many seconds or you can do that for this many reps and then put your instrument down is a good place to start to kind of keep the pulse of class going in. sometimes too, they don't need to leave their seats to do that. They can just be like, okay, here's, stop. seconds, which at that on your own or do that twice and then we'll come back and just leave them sitting in their seats. But sometimes that, you know, scramble seating, it looks like, you know, the rice mob doing a marching band show is exactly what they need. And it just depends, you gotta read the kids and read the room. But to me, to kind of close this out, this idea of connecting fall to spring is kind of something we talk about more at band, and especially in high school band, because there is a pretty clear divide sometimes between the way we approach marching band and the way we approach sit-down band, which I've never subscribed to, but I've known some people too. But to me, what this kind of points out, what these conversations point out, is that the things we tend to think of, like Andrea being in the six-day honor band room, where people are playing crazy literature at really high level, it's just mind blowing. It kind of makes you want to just hang it up and be like, okay, I'm never gonna do that, so we're done. Well, that would be me, because I don't teach on solos anymore. But within that, that's a secondary marker of achievement to me in a given year. Like that, it's almost like, how will those kids play a fundamental skills and ensemble is the primary marker of their learning? Like, how we play, you know, the... we play one or how we play this exercise that combines, you know, like a scalar thing with articulation and range and all that, like how we can make that sound as an ensemble, that's a primary marker because that shows up in the literature and it shows up at a much, much higher level maybe because there's fewer people doing it. But if everyone can do it at a really high level, we know that they have the skills and it's just a matter of getting their brains around how to do that in that setting. And so to me, this idea of creating threads and connections through the year is way less about how the literature lines up. think it's going to because that's the way we think and it should because that is helpful to the students, but it's more about how the fundamental skills develop over time. And we're working where we are working on those and I'm going to show up in the music or pulling them from the music and we see a consistent kind of group of them moving across the year. All of a sudden, we're achieving both the primary and the secondary improvement matrices if we want to think about that way. But another way to think about it too, that we kind of touched on a little bit is it's more about their personal accountability and how they do things, how students approach their instrument individually, but also then in the ensemble. That's a primary marker of learning, like how when they pick up their instrument, what do they do and how do they approach problems? How do they solve the problems before we as the teacher need to go and solve them for them? And given that so many of our kids come from either helicopter parents or what's the new one bulldozer parents or snow plow parents or there's all sorts of parenting that involves destroying the thing in front of your kids so they don't have to face challenges, we know that that's something they're going to need because the real world doesn't have that. You know, your mom and dad aren't going to bring you your briefcase at the job interview because you forgot at home, at least I hope they're not. So, you know, this idea of how they approach things kind of as an add-on benefit of, okay, if we expect these things out of them, over time they're going to grow into them. It's just up to us to be one patient but also realistic of, am I doing enough? And the answer's probably going to be, no, I can always do more. We always think that way because... these humans are really good at identifying problems, especially musicians. There's actually research out that says our self-efficacy, our thought process about how well we do things, he's in the gutter, absolutely in the bottom of the dumpster compared to everybody else, musicians in general. We have terrible, terrible mental health, which we as musicians go, well, yeah, that makes sense, but it's not just us, it's all musicians. So we at least have that going for us. And so to me, this idea of one patient on our part, also building these skills and students, that's a way to combat that. That's way to go, no, you have this power to do this thing. By the time you get done here, you don't need me anymore. You've got all the tools and you know how to do the thing. when a kid graduates from the Clean High School or graduates from the Woodlands High School or graduates from any high school, the goal there to me as a teacher should be that they can operate completely independently of their music program and still be a functional musician in an ensemble context. And maybe the Americans sound the best for the context that they show, but at Mediachi, they might not really know what they're doing, but they have the tools to go, oh, I hear that thing, so I'm going to imitate it. I know how this works in an ensemble, but I'm going to do these things, at least as a place to start. And to me, if we're doing that as teachers, on top of keeping them excited about music and giving them a place to experience the emotional release and all the cool things that happen in there and keeping them wanting to do that after they leave high school and after they leave college, I think we're doing a very good job. But part of that comes down to, what are the threads that we connect across that academic year and how do we grow those from year to year with our kids, especially if we see them in different ensembles every year? All of sudden then it becomes something where it's like, okay, here's what this level of the game looks like. This is sixth grade, here's seventh grade, it's this level, it's harder room. The sun is trying to kill you like it does in Mario. And then this over here, and all of a sudden we have these manufactured and these systemic levels. That we can just play within and see what works for our kids to get them to the places we want them to get to so I mean to me that is That kind of thought process is a lot more freeing than I got to do this piece by Maine It's got to be perfect and it's got it so all the sudden I have little bit more one freedom to explore things But to the the focus is not how can I make you know this piece? Sound amazing the focus is how do I make the ensemble sound amazing? While doing this piece like how do I give them the skills to sound amazing that we can raft onto this piece or whatever piece We put in front of them and I mean that's that's part of how mr. got his kids to play music for Prague in 1970 Because it was written two years before There are still some colleges that can't get through that piece and yet his middle schoolers did all that being said I know it's what partially it's the magic of it being green All of us wish we had in all this trying foster when we see it in ourselves But I don't want to hold you guys long because I know we went over last time, but did you guys get the materials that I sent out, like the summary recap and all that, okay, good. You'll be getting another one of those in the morning, and this tab and thing is way more powerful than I thought it was going be. So it does some really cool things. So I'm going to see if I can boost those up to and how I share stuff and how I'm documenting things. I'm learning the tool and I think it's really cool, and I'm going see if I can pay for it for me. We'll see. @1:05:32 - Andrea T. Maher I'm not holding my breath, but... @1:05:34 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) All right. Well, thank you guys so much, and I hope you have a great rest of your evening, and I will see you next week.",

The goal was to explore ways to provide meaningful feedback to students, design effective rubrics, and ensure assessments support both short-term and long-term musical development. Key Takeaways Informal, in-the-moment feedback comprises the vast majority (~95%) of assessment in music classrooms. This \"dipsticking\" assessment focuses on fundamentals like posture, tone, and hand position. While pervasive, it can be unstructured. Formal assessments like graded playing tests and pass-offs are less frequent but critical for accountability and measuring individual progress. They typically involve hearing students individually or in small groups. Rubrics are powerful assessment tools if designed thoughtfully. Effective rubrics have a small number of weighted categories and clear, specific language defining each level. Overly complex rubrics become unmanageable. While grades matter to many students, parents, and administrators, the most important assessment aspect is providing high-quality, specific, actionable feedback. The goal is feedback that helps students self-assess and self-correct. Having a \"spine\" or 1-2 focus areas for each lesson/assessment cycle makes assessing more manageable for teachers and helps students identify critical skills to develop. This focus should connect back to fundamentals. Topics Informal (In-the-Moment) Assessment Strategies The teachers shared several techniques they use for informal assessment during rehearsals: Frequently getting off the podium and moving around the ensemble to hear different instrument sections and get a variety of perspectives Focusing feedback on fundamental skills like posture, tone production, hand position, etc., since these have an outsized impact on overall performance Choosing 1-2 focus areas or a \"spine\" for each lesson or assessment cycle to prioritize the most critical skills to work on and assess Utilizing peer feedback by having students evaluate each other's performances using guided prompts Recording the full ensemble and having students assess certain elements of the performance Designing Effective Rubrics The teachers discussed the pros and cons of using rubrics for formal playing assessments. Key tips included: Keeping the rubric as simple as possible - too many criteria or levels become unmanageable for teachers and students Weighting rubric categories appropriately based on importance to overall performance Using clear, specific, descriptive language to define each level of the rubric so expectations are transparent Viewing rubrics as a powerful tool for norm expectations and grading if designed and used consistently Providing High-Quality Feedback All the teachers agreed that while grades matter to various stakeholders, the most important assessment aspect is providing high-quality feedback to students. Strategies for meaningful feedback included: Being as specific and actionable as possible so students know exactly what to work on Connecting feedback on repertoire to what was worked on in fundamentals, warm-ups, and lesson \"spines\" Aiming to provide feedback that helps students learn to self-assess so they can practice more independently Using a variety of feedback modes: verbal, written, demonstration, and peer-to-peer Transcript @5:56 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I think we have our quorum for the evening. So, thank you guys for making some time on a Tuesday night to talk about assessment, which is, you know, what we all love talking about as undergraduates. I know I just see the sparkles in the eyes and the pep and the stuff, and we talk about that with my undergraduates. So, you know, they're just there in love with it, and I'm sure you are too, and no, none of that's true. But it's a vital thing we have to do. And it's something that we honestly, we think about probably more than we, we realize because we do it in so many different ways. So, we're always kind of thinking about assessment, which kind of one of the biggest things that dominates our mind as a music teacher, even beyond like things like what piece we're playing, that's gonna change. But the assessments that we do are ongoing and are evergreen a lot of ways. Like they've never get stale than every old, because we use it every day. And so what I wanted to do tonight was kind of explore a little bit of the ways that kids can of the language you might have used in college classes or you might use in your own work, but then also think about some ways and share some thoughts on how you can structure your assessments to be, one, not very time consuming, two, useful to your students in a direct way, on giving them a grade, I realize might be a requirement, do you have so many grades a week or so many grades a month or something, so it can serve two purposes and three, that they support both long and short term development in the students, so that's kind of the sum total that we're going to talk about, and so I guess the first thing that I want to kind of focus on is the big buckets of assessment that we do, the big kind of categories of assessment that we do in education, and you can think about formative and summative, but I like to think more about in formative and summative, because formative and summative, like you can zoom out enough on formative and summative that everything becomes Formative or everything becomes summative, you know, like if you do think carrying an else on something You eventually just transition to a one relationship So it's that sort of thing and so I don't find that in the usual conversation as thinking about informal versus formal Where the difference there is informal is kind of in the middle of things called you Michael the dip sticking Where like you can take part your engine to see how much oil you have for you to pull the dip stick up and put it back Without changing the way the engine is So informal assessment is very much that like off the cuff walking on the run the stand podium I'm like giving that feedback to kids and then formal or kind of tests that we do the things that produce a grade Things that go in the grade book or the things that go in in the LMS or whatever system it is you using your school And to me what I noticed more than anything is that we as teachers These are teachers tend to live in informal assessment like 95% of our assessments are informal We might listen to kids individually But in terms of the actual quantity of time we're spending with kids, that is a small percentage because one, there are sometimes, you know, 60 or 70 kids to one teacher. So it's hard for your individual give them a grade, but two, the way our arms will be structured, we see them in groups more often, and it's hard to do individual assessment there, but from a time perspective, but also logistics perspective. So we do a lot more informal, just in the whole group, we're getting close to a student and giving them feedback about producing a grade, just because from a logistical standpoint, that's a little bit easier to wrap our arms around. So what I'm curious about is working with those definitions of informal and formal. What kind of informal assessment are your noises behind me? just want to warn you. have twin daughters. They might be coming in with me. We will see in a moment, I hear noises because their room is right behind the office, but we'll see. Back to the top of your hand. So when you're thinking about informal assessment, what are some ways you like you do that like whether it's here's what I focus on over here's how I get to the place in the room physically or intellectually to give that assessment Where are some things that come to mind thinking about that for you? @11:19 - vince caruso Just I mean when we're doing fundamentals, you know the beginning of the rehearsal process I just I just like to get off the podium and move around Mm-hmm lean over kids shoulders point things out or Just hear things from a different perspective in the podium If you were going to kind of say the time to do that, what's the most common Kind of thing you talk about with the students like what comes up the most often is something for them to address Um Probably just tone tension tension posture hand position things that affect their the sound they're creating @12:00 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) If they're consistently consistent, that is something we always have to mind. But it's interesting because, I mean, I'll tell you, Lauren, probably, I don't, I want to speak for you because I'm not going to want you to go rehearsal without a student teacher. But, like, I know when I was teaching, that was primarily, it was tone, but also like, are you listening? What you listening to? Where are your ears at right now? What's the thing that's important to you as a student? I want you to focus your attention here, if it's, if they're like, you're, which is kind of normal. They just get the black look on their face. It's like, okay, I you to listen to the trumpets because you put the clarinet and we're going to work on a march and today we're going to focus on that balance. So I want you kind of listening to that before we get started. So like, that same sort of thing, tone with kind of this, the other kind of point being their awareness of their own tone and other things around them, really common for, for me too, that similar to you, Lauren? @12:53 - Lauren Kaminski I agree, and I mean, sometimes, you know, in rehearsal. It is more of oh, let me hear this group play and you give them feedback Versus sectionals is where I might go down the line and do more of a okay Let me hear you and I'm giving you individual feedback and maybe I take a grade under there. Maybe I don't But generally more often than not I'm not gonna I generally don't make individuals I don't know why actually but I guess for trying to say but in class with their music and stuff almost hear groups and And give feedback that way and I mean I do hear scales like we'll do for region and stuff I mean it'll be a pull out of the bucket and we'll do region a tooth and stuff like that During that time and give feedback that way But I guess during my full rehearsals I don't know I might do more about this year on music with region stuff I do feel like I'm good with hearing individuals and and doing that but generally in full bandit is more of general comments And like you said tone and who are you listening to and are we fitting in and what is our balance? Like, because that's what they mean. @14:02 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, because I mean a lot of times that you don't know what they don't know. They're in the truest and purest sense of the word because they're kids, especially teaching middle school. Like, they're as worried about lunch and whatever weird thing is up in their head at their arm of what they're supposed to doing in music. So that's a constant game of relying for them. I tell the undergraduates the middle schoolers have a teplon on their brains, just kind of things slide off. So you have to be really consistent and really patient with them. What about you, Ariana? What do you find most commonly that you kind of address in your informal assessment in the classroom? @14:42 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) I think the biggest thing for me is usually some version of posture, because that is going to affect your position. So therefore, intonation, like lots of pizza boxes, being carried around instead of our nice, you know. a straight risk. So really, I think more than anything that you know, that or behold are going to be the two biggest things that are going to affect my students' sound and therefore, like I said, their intonation before we even get into, do they have the correct finger down in the correct spot? know, there was a word there that I was going for and I just lost my brain. But you know, not even making sure they're playing the right note, ish, but like, is that because it wasn't about to tune because we didn't tune our instrument right, because we don't have a shoulder rest, because our wrist is collapsed, we're playing the flat fingers, you know, are we pushing too hard with the bow? All those fun things. I always tell them, you know, we sit there and listen to beginning bands, I think I talked about this before, playing through like full multi-part pieces by Winter. concert, and you know, we're like on plucking Tinkle Tinkle Little Star, and I'm like, the finesse it takes to play a string instrument, like from somebody who has learned them all now, like, it's not even the same. Like, they push buttons down, and yes, they have to do certain things with their mouth, and I understand them. And, you know, because I did all that, but also, like, you have so many more things to worry about in the beginning, but like, don't compare, because they feel so down about themselves, and like, you're, you're good, you're good. You have more little teeny, tiny things to worry about right now. You get to steal the show later. @16:36 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, and you guys, and once they get the kind of chops going, they didn't practice far longer than when players can. Oh, yeah. Which is, you know, maybe to their benefit, maybe not depending on the kid, but then it's just because Lauren and Ariana have already met each other. Lauren teaches orchestra, and suburban Virginia. @16:56 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) One of the suburbs of DC, right? me. @17:02 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) We had a meeting here with the twins, so my apologies. @17:05 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) You're good. You're good. I actually went by Lauren for years, so go. @17:10 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You're good. Also. @17:13 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) Yeah. Halfway between DC and Richmond. So. @17:18 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So we have representation from both ghosts right now and the middle. We're just missing somebody in the mountains unfortunately. So no one from Colorado. So. Here we are. I know. So, you know, this is the idea of like, you know, we all kind of. Three of us and all four of us are to do myself kind of. Fund ourselves focusing on some common themes, but the common themes all touch back on fundamental qualities of playing. Tone. Posture. And in strings posture is even more important because just because of the way things are set up, the physicality of actually pulling the instrument and moving it is is more consequential. They're more moving apart space. basically, with the exception of maybe trombone, to extend to bud percussion, and just because it's own variety. So one of the things that the informal assessment is, this is a kind of a rhetorical question, but something to think about, is how much of your instruction, how much of your actual lesson plan creates space where the students understand that thing, thing you find yourself talking about most commonly, or the thing maybe that's most important for that day, whether it's talent or something else. How much of your lesson plan actually creates space where you can make it clear to the students that that is the priority? For that day, for that kind of part of rehearsal we're talking about, the daily drill, fundamental aspect of things. Are you creating not just the space, but the ability for you to connect? Here's this thing we're doing. Here's the skill that we're working on. Here's how they... they sit together, are you aware of this? And can you, as a student, monitor yourself, or at least evaluate was this time better than last time, the next time needs to be better in these three ways, right? Because that's, I think, one of the keys for all of us, because we do have ensembles, is that we need to have the students to a certain extent become at least, if not fully self-correcting, at least self-monitoring, and be able to kind of tag things and go, okay, that wasn't good, or I didn't like that, or I don't know what that was, but it wasn't what I thought it was gonna be. Like, basically, they serve as air detectors, so you aren't the only one who we're getting about it. And the question, where does it fit in your lesson, or how it happened to be to create space? I think it's a two-part one. One, there's gonna be spots in the mirror, so whether it's fundamentals, or whether it's like, working on a record ball, or something in the middle, working on region A2, or working on audition materials, or something like that, that it was most comfortable. We know that we're really comfortably talking about fundamentals where we're going focus on in tone today. going to do tone in our articulation, whatever the combination is we want to focus on. But how do we bring that over from an assessment perspective into the music? How do we hold their feet to the fire? You did this in warm-up. You did this in fundamentals. play this way with these qualities, these kind of good things, and then we put it on the notes. And everything changes. Do you create space? There will be some ways you would think of having what's going be bad with for three minutes now. To create that in your rubber quad, tie back to either fundamentals or kind of this general, hey, we're going to focus on our quality of sound just to use that as an example. will be some ways you think you could do that besides just going, hey, listen to your sound. Like, can you think of examples maybe where you did that in the past or things that you think you might be able to do this coming year that would help make it at me tighter. @21:05 - Lauren Kaminski Well, one kind of observation of that that I have from teaching the high school the region to this week is we do fundamentals. Okay, everyone's sounding pretty good, registered slurs, all that stuff. We get to the music. So I started telling, I was like, your goal is to carry everything we've done, you know, making our corners firm, doing all the things, making sure your tongue is raised. When we get over to the region music, we have to transfer because right now we're not transferring the fundamentals over. And so I started talking to them about that. And so it did get better. they started, I think thinking like, okay, I am doing this. And yeah, now I'm doing a harder thing, a harder skill, but I do need to transfer the knowledge over. And so that was one thing I've been kind of preaching this last week was we have to sound the same, like it's great we're sounding better. the fundamentals, but we have to get the fundamentals to carry over into our music now. It can't just be playing good fundamentals, and now we're going back to our old way when we get to the music. @22:14 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Right. They're not separate skills. @22:15 - Lauren Kaminski They're supposed to be linked. Yes. Yes. And for my own band, I feel like sometimes they know, it's kind of like you said, training the middle school kids to like here. So, you know, questioning them and me just not always giving them the answers every single time. when we get done asking them what they heard or when clinicians come out to, I think that's very valuable. And they'll call them out on stuff too, like, they'll done that way better before this was a mental thing with you guys and not anything that like you're doing here wise, it's just your brain is working against you, so you need to focus on what you're doing as opposed to just trying to not think at all. @22:59 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Right. @23:00 - Lauren Kaminski Or, you know, go. Yeah, which can happen sometimes with fundamentals because they're middle school kids and yeah. @23:07 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, we did the daily drill thing, the church of Custom F and the mechanics met you down in strong here in Texas. But I've actually talked to college kids. Did you guys do that in high school? Yeah, did you like it? No. Do you like it now? No, you know what it does? They don't make the connection even as college students until we make it very clear it's like, this needs to set this up and these are connected this way. And even then sometimes it takes them getting out in the field and working with people like Lauren that are actually doing it and they go, oh, that makes so much more sense now. So that's interesting. The thinking, because it's most recent, what were some ways that you kind of had the students tie together the work that you did in fundamentals in their region attitudes with the kids over the high school? Were there any specific strategies you used or was it just like, hey, need to kind of remember what that was? and make a show up here. @24:01 - Lauren Kaminski Yeah, I mean, I would play for them. And then just the constant, like, once I kind of talked about transferring the skills, like if you got your Warner's firmer and register slurs, and you, or you raised your tongue, or whatever you did, like, you've got to remember to do that when you're playing in your region atus. And so just kind of that reminder, and I mean, it was quite a few reminders, you know, like we have to transfer, we have to transfer the knowledge. And so every day during fundamentals, I would kind of start talking about, okay, remember what the skills like, it needs to transfer over. So I would play, and I would have some kids play also, like, yes, they, you know, they sound good, or hey, can you get your corner firmer? Okay, look, now you can do it too, like we just have to remember and transfer and make it happen into our music. @24:47 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Mm-hmm, awesome. And I mean, that's often the squeaky wheel, sort of approach the things, because the kids don't want listen to that. They want to do the thing, and they want to play, and they know, okay, If it's better, this teacher's not going to stop fussing about this. And the other thing, too, is, and this is tricky with high school and it was in middle school, but it's tricky with all kids that are smart, and most hard kids in fine arts are smarter, because smart kids want to do fine arts. It's just the way it is, that we can't let go, let's say we're working on our music, and there's a skill in there that showed up in our public Let's say it's like a slur or some sort of technique thing, and they're not transferring the learning. There are days, we've all these days, where you could go, hey, let's play that exercise again from earlier, and I want you to remember what that feels like and then apply it so you kind of shorten the time distance between the fundamental aspect that you might work on in your fundamentals and the application, kind of bring them closer together. I was talking about like the two-headed monster on the Sesame Street, where it's a cop, and then we're working together. That works on days, but some days for whatever reason that offends the students. They see them beneath them. to do that stuff again, and I don't know. So I think this idea of just the author of Honor that they do remember what that felt like, and especially this, you'll remember, but give them a target. What did that feel like to do that thing? What did it sound like to play that way? Can you bring more of that into what you're doing now? I think that's a really cool way that doesn't potentially create the resentment. The other one seems to you But then, like you were saying earlier, Lauren, I think not just like the person in the person on the row, but like the small segments. Okay, let's say we have two rows of player, I want the first row to play that. And I want you guys to remember what that felt like to do in the fundamental. You do that in isolation, and you do the second row, then you give each feedback about general qualities of what they need to work on to make the fundamental, show it more in the actual application. But even that, I think, is kind of a good bridge where they still get to hear other people that are not always playing. They're listening to other people where one of the people do. And I also give you a chance to kind Pull aside the curtain and see a little bit of how kids are doing things in in media res like in a authentic setting You know within that though that can take time right as we have to pick our battles on that one is is this really worth doing this and I guess that kind of leads to this this idea that I Have been kind of pointing towards Having I call it spine dear lesson or I mean good thing that way too, but not in a sense of like we need to make music better I think that's kind of a given. We're always gonna try to make something better for musicians It's how we're trained for why our mental health is not fantastic as very on a point of help but Having like a kind of a central thing that you want to focus on and whether you tell the students are like today We're gonna focus mostly and work on an undergraduate with this week One because that's kind of where they can think sophistication wise, but we're all there teachers So we could probably have two or three. I wouldn't go more than that though Because there's one for you to keep up with for the kids to kind of So, like, today's going to be a tone-focused day, or today's going to be a posture and reading-focused day, or today's going to be an articulation-focused day, and you're not going to ignore the other stuff that goes wrong. Like, there's going to be a lot of something that goes wrong, and you're going to address it and, like, point it out and make sure they're aware of it, and they're going to fix it. But the deep conversations, if they have it, but the majority of your conversation with the students focuses their attention on these elements in a way that does exactly what we're just talking about. brings their attention to the fundamental and makes them apply it to the thing they're doing now through some sort of kinesthetic memory, maybe, or some sort of conceptual memory, or even just a evaluative thing. When it's like, okay, you know, you can do the birthdays. Okay, everyone has birthdays between January and the end of June. I want you to play this every last one. Listen, you're going evaluate them. Then you flip. And you're evaluating on the basis of these things. Like, we're going to listen to this. sound in the way that their sound changes or doesn't when they go high and when they go low. Okay, group one, play, group two. How many people are the sound change like real binary sort of feedback? Who were the sound change? Who were the sound say the same? How many people are like on a scale of one to five? What do you think their sound was? Quality wise, the best one is the worst. You kind of get a sense of where everybody's at. Then you switch and all of a sudden that second group now goes, oh, I have to be better than what I've heard or the good kids are because they're really into it. And the other kids, they kind of come along. They kind of get swept along by the momentum of everyone doing things. So just stuff to think about when it comes to like this informal assessment, it can kind of seem like it sticks sometimes. But I think the more that we find different ways to do it on different days, one, we don't get bored. Two, there's enough variety that is not just saying the same thing to the kids over and over again, but three, the themes are consistent enough. of set of things we picked from fundamental skills or whatever it is, are consistent enough that over time they come across it and look like that siro-based curriculum. They're coming across it again at a higher level of sophistication over and over and over again, increasingly more sophisticated. Even if it's just by looking at each day, all of a sudden at the end of the semester or the end of the conscience cycle or the end of the year, they're focusing on the same thing but it's at a completely different level than what they were doing before. And I think that's the part that is easy to lose sight of in the heat of the lump in the day-to-day of things because we as teachers just we have so much to take care of. There's all the administration, there's all like attendance which is about least everything to do, lot of them don't have to do for college but there's also like the random stuff that you're coming out with a note from the office and I mean like all that kind of stuff, we get lost in that. So if we develop either have it or even they just split it like you go and pull a card out of the deck like 10 cards and this is what the focus is gonna be today. We're on Sunday. You go Here's the two folk out the folk guy for this week It's gonna be these two things and you know that those are things that working on them's not gonna make anything worse They're just gonna make things better and there's some transfer beyond like tone is gonna increase other aspects like clarity residents Tambor like the maturity of the side of the open to get better when you focus on tone, but also Our ability to hear all the members of the cord and hear them so we can balance them are doing that All of sudden becomes much easier to do when we're focusing on tone. So there's these add-on effects that we come across too So within this idea of informal assessment One of the things that kind of struck me is creating these themes or these spines here Bussing is a way to be way more efficient. you don't look like we're liars You're setting the kids up to be self-attessing if you structure it correctly at end of the day, you're also drawing their attention to fundamental skills and transfer beyond the things that you're working on, given peace, like the fundamental show up on everything they do, not just in, you know, of done again or whatever you're playing that day. So, and if you haven't played nights of done again, you probably should because it's every fun which fun. And I take the trumpets below the staff, I think, which is not always a thing they do. So, so within that idea of informal assessment, what are some other kind of, fundamental topics that you might come across, like, we talked about tone a lot, we talked about posture as kind of a gateway, especially in strings, to being able to have good tone. If you don't have good posture, good tone is really hard to come by. What are some other ones you've come across in your teaching that kind of stand out as, general enough to be useful, but specifically enough to, you can see improvement. @32:50 - Lauren Kaminski I like playing in tune and getting kids to hear if they aren't, and I mean, Some of mine have the tuner clips, oboes and double reads, and my flutes play with the tuner clips. have a few clarinets that did, but just getting them to be aware of listening and how listen to their section and playing in tune, and then playing in tune within the ensemble. @33:19 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Right, and even knowing what out of tune playing sounds like, right, like the beats of interference, and kind of slower it is the closer you are, like something's not even understanding that. And we kind of take it as soon, you know, like, I don't. So, yeah, that's a really good one. @33:36 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) Anybody else? Playing the right notes. Totally. Like even away from like ergonomically covered technique, pushing on the right button, putting the right fingers on the on the fingerboard. Yeah, wait, I feel like it's such a given it shouldn't be, but yeah. @33:55 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay, then I'll let you have the idea. We're looking at a, I mean, reading anything in another type is kind of more miraculous. staring at like aimed on dead trees and hallucinating vividly to create things in our head like that. That's weird to know itself. But once we kind of accept that, when they see a given note and knowing that which these buttons are or this is finger pattern for this, or here's the alternate finger I'm using because of these reasons. As we get into some more advanced things, that's not always something kids map really well, especially with new stuff. Like we've all seen the kids write the letters in for the ledger lines, whether it's below the staff or above the staff. don't want to do what I'm dealing with like tuba, like low tuba, or like high flute. Right then, huh? Or yes, yes. If you have to deal with violas and bassoons and problems and also club, we like candles for you and just pray because that is really torture. Well, not as torture said some things, but up there. You know, all this things are like helping kids map those names, like creating this response and I see that and push down this button and here's what it sounds like, is a like a feedback loop that we need to close, we need to help them close, and feedback is one of the strongest ways to do that because kids learn experientially, but if they just do the same thing or don't we're going to the good thing we're doing it, because they're doing it a lot, like they just get better little by little, but if we create some sort of focus that builds, like okay, we're going to focus on tone for the first week and we're going to focus on tone and articulation and we're going to add technique to that, like, not as a thing that we're talking about, but as thing we're really carving on, we're always talking about it, but we're carving on it this week, all of a sudden we start to see that improvement instead of just kind of being linear and enigmatic, it becomes exponential for some kids who are paying attention and linking those skills together to see massive returns on their time, because of the focus they have. There's actually, if you're at all a research here. Which I know I might be the only person on the call of the day is, but there are really good papers on folks detention that Amy Simmons at UT and I remember his name, persons at John Parsons at Texas Tech have done where they, and John is I think new in the band job at Texas Tech, folks of detention basically internal or external or you do teachers tell kids who focus on things that are inside their body like in terms of like what it feels like to do something or they focus on external like what does it sound like to do something and they actually went and looked at several different teachers at several different levels in instrumental spaces to see what happened the most often what they found was the teachers at experience mostly success were the ones that linked what does it sound like to what it feels like and they just created that cycle I'm like okay here's the way it feels to play that note now here's what it's sounds like. And here's what you want for something. So, here's how you make it better from field perspective to make the sound better, it becomes that virtuous cycle all the way through. I'll include that paper because it's behind a table. So, I'll include actually the whole paper, if you want to read it in the email sent in to follow up tomorrow morning. If you don't want to read it, my suggestion is to plug it into chat GPT and ask for summary at whatever degree level you feel comfortable with. If entertaining to do that, please summarize this as if I were a five-year-old. It's really, really fun to see what it does. AI is ever so much fun. All that said, the informal aspect of things. So, it was like 85, 90, 95 percent of our assessment. It's the vast majority of what our students experience in terms of assessment that they might not realize is assessment. Like, if you ask an average high schooler, okay, your teacher was assessing you today. did they assess you on? They're going to let you be speaking a foreign language. One, because assessment's a weird thing to say to a high to, once they even get past that, we just had rehearsal, we did the thing. I don't know what you're asking me. Because most kids think of formal assessments as assessments, tests like math tests and whatever else they're taking, but also in our case, know, playing tests. We hear the kids play individually in small groups. So what are some ways that you as a teacher use formal assessments? Lauren, you talked a little bit about hearing kids individually for, like, region band scales and atunes. Is that something you do for, like, concert music too? @38:36 - Lauren Kaminski How do you set that up? do you structure it? Yeah, I mean, so for a region, I do, we have Schoology, and so their scales have to be video. And generally, I do some pass-offs live on my scales, but they're super easy for kids to record and just listen to, and it's pretty cut and dry. You know, they know how to set the metronome with it. of their metronome going at the whatever tempo. I kind of tell them, like, if you play around, no, don't bother submitting it, like retry. So I'll do scale pass-offs and kind of incrementally get faster as we go through the region process. And then I'll hear live stuff for region and sectionals and in class, we'll do draw the name out of the hats or the wheel decide. We'll do that with scales too, and they'll play in front of each other. And then I'll do the same thing for concert music when we get into UIL and stuff. We'll do sections. Sometimes I'll tell them ahead of time, like, hey, I'm going to hear this. And sometimes it'll just be, all right, we're going to start here and, like, if it sounds bad, then I'll just go down the row. And, oh, you need to work on this, try again. Or, oh, if that was good, or I need to hear that again next week. So sometimes I will give them advanced warning. And sometimes it's like, if I'm going through something and something sounds bad, I'll stop and be like, right, you're up. Boom, boom, boom. So, that's kind of where most of my stuff consists. I tried to do etude stuff online, but the kids just, I don't, this is when I first got there and so they weren't all, they weren't my kids at all. Like none of them were my beginners or anything. And I just felt like they submitted stuff and they didn't understand if it was wrong or right. So, I feel like it was just a waste of my time to sit there and grade. And whether I get that in person and actually give them like feedback right then like soft, like this is completely wrong. But I felt like the scales were pretty cut and dry and they understood, yes, she's going to pass this off or no, she isn't. And like I'm so hardcore that my clarinet's have to show their hand position so I can make sure they're doing the right finger patterns. Like I don't pass off with the strong finger patterns, but this is one of the things. Yes. Yes. @41:00 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) What about you Vince? @41:03 - vince caruso Yeah, as far as formal stuff, the scale assessment thing, similar to what Lauren said, know from what I've seen and heard of the kind of the band culture in Texas that having sectionals is a big part of both the middle school and the high school thing, that's not necessarily thing that's too common in this neck of the woods. And so pretty much everything we get done is in class. So I'm a big fan of hearing kids live versus recorded, but given our schedule and the limited time we have together, a lot of times I'll do them recorded. Or I'll give them the option, like this is the scale of the week or whatever we're doing, and who's ready to pass this off. And if kids want to play it live, that's great because they get the immediate feedback. if they record it, I'm going give them the same feedback, but they're less apt to read it, what I've typed into Canvas. And so the live thing is way more efficient. I think our struggle has been just having a culture where kids just expect to play for each other, and that's not a big deal. And that really has to be developed from the beginning. Because if they're not used to that by the time they get to meet the high school, it's like the kids who are killing it are ready to show off, and the kids who are struggling are like terrified. But yeah, so we do a lot of the scale thing during when we're working on concert repertoire or whatever, then sometimes I'll hear our sign excerpts to do that. So, you know, very similar kind of stuff. I've not ever really gotten into rubrics a whole lot. has been more of a time suck to fill out the rubric that they may or may not really use. I just feel like it's valuable for them to get feedback in the moment and then, okay, I'll hear you do it next time. know, here's the feedback. You're the things to work on. I'll hear you do it again in a couple days or next week or whatever. But yeah, we do a lot of that stuff. I mean, one of the reasons I signed up for this was like, how can I be more efficient with this doing it during class? Give on our schedule and things like that. @43:34 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So, well, and this is kind of a theme that I've read several times. We're kind of speaking to that specifically. We'll get to rubrics in a second. actually have a couple things that I've come across. I think are really useful for those. Actually, a resource I'll share with you the environment now that I've come across. It's a little, it's older, but I think it's a really good place to start from when you're thinking about creating a rubric that doesn't take much time because they've done a lot of heavy lifting for you, but back to this topic. know, like, When we're doing things class, having a list of, here, the X-shirt we're going to do for this piece. Like, let's say you're doing a festival version, know, that's just go to the other extreme, feminize them done again, do something way harder. So, like, you know, okay, trumpets. first X measures, I'm going to want to hear you do that in front of everybody, because that's super close for you. And it's a really important part of the song for the piece, because it starts us off, right? And whatever else you want to pick. Like, having the students have a list of, here's what you're expected to know. Now, if you've prepared enough, that's up to you. But I'm going to want to to this at some point. So, I think it currently could be on that kind of It gives them something that isn't just a whole piece and, you know, playing donuts, which a lot of them just, again, they're offended by that, it's so easy. well, let's talk about that. But the other side of it is, it also makes you go easier, because you don't have to think about it. Hey, trumpets. Like, you're actually a machine. Let's do number one today. One, two, ready, go. to go down the line and get some feedback that way if we're dealing with constantly because scales are kind of self-contained right it looks like one octave two octaves three octaves spinning on scale that takes some time it takes to turn them on or whatever you use and you can go down pretty efficiently but it gets much more difficult in peace if we haven't done pre-processing we haven't gone through it identify the excerpts for the kids and for ourselves so that we have to be less thinking in the moment and more assigning assessing feedback and do that sort of thing um what about you Ariana um we had a big conversation about our creating policy changes at school today so I'm not gonna say anything so but thinking for me like a formal when you're saying formal and informal I know you're meaning more like casual in the moment versus like a graded thing but for me like @46:00 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) A formal assessment is going to be like a higher value test playing test. I've always allowed we use Canvas and so I let students either do the testing class or they can record it. If I, and then I, the closer we get to concerts, you know, when we're like really time to dig in, I stop, I stop doing in class playing tests because I'm like, you don't have time. But then playing tests don't get done. So I'm looking at ways to be better about that this year to be more efficient because like I mentioned before, we're down from 80 to 50 minutes and then on Fridays is even less time because we've taken out 40 minutes of the day to do. We don't know what. It's, yeah, so, but I usually do like skills, obviously, or I don't necessarily come up with an excerpt sheet at the beginning because that's. that requires pre-planning that I've never, I haven't had since my first year teaching, let's put it that way, when I would spend like two hours on Sunday making Wilson plans for second band. And I abandoned that relatively quickly after that year because I didn't do anything except my job. But I will do, you know, rehearsal chunks. I usually assign since we're on an AB schedule where x, y, which is confusing. you know, so I'll either see them Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Tuesday, Thursday. so whichever is the last day I see them that week, whatever was like usually the first day as we work through something, I'll identify the section that's pretty rough. And so that'll be our main focus the next time I see them. And then they have until Monday or Tuesday, the next time I see them to do their playing test. So that way, I'm kind of there because I've noticed before there's spots that I think they're going to have a real hard time with it. They'll just blow through and I'm like, oh, we got this. Okay. And then something that I'll think is going to be super easy will trip everybody up. The downside is that like sometimes, you know, especially, you know, bases are going to have like two parts essentially. And I'm like, you got nothing here. Like, let me assign a different part for you what something you need to work on this week. But so I try to, I really only do about one grade a week. But it's really based on what did we do this week that needs more attention. Okay, we identified it. Let's work through it together. Let's troubleshoot it. Let's create ways to work on it at home. Let me, know, model that for you in the classroom. on it, submit it. @48:46 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Right. Okay. both, you and Vince have both mentioned this idea of like, some kids student class can do a record event on their preference. I'm sure there's some overlap. There's like the kind of kids that want to do in class and the kinds of kids are like, you know what? Part half, I'm just new on my own. @49:02 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) Sometime. @49:03 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) consistent, but we noticed that some kids are the ones that aren't trying to handle all the lines and some consort. Always don't want to do any cuts, but it's kind of like, oh, something's going on, need to check in with you. Something to consider with that is this idea, especially because all three of us have LMSs we deal with, whether it's in of G or for Canvas, fortunately nobody has a lot of orgs, I think that was the worst. But this idea of mastery-based learning, so where you basically can try as many times as you want to until you are, until you mastered it. It's a variant of what you said, Lauren. like, if it has mistakes, don't turn it in. Because on scales, it's straightforward. It's not a wrong button. Go back and do it again. We're doing one scale of time and two scales. like, that's not that big of a deal. All 12 makers scales, and you mess up one thing, that's going be demoralizing. I think we're good, but that's a different conversation. This idea of like, OK, here's your four pass-offs. for this object type or whatever that is, however that you have, and here's the eight scales we're working on this part of the semester, whatever it is. And then you can turn those into, like, from all the beginning, turn them all into the end, hope you're going to do it, you're going to get a break of the end, but you can turn them in as many times as you want to, I will keep the score for the best one, and you can turn them in over and over again until you've mastered it. Now, the first question we all ask of any one is, what are the kids actually going to do that? And the first answer is, if you create system where in a culture where that's the expectation, yes, and that's the time. Like, this isn't something that gets all over night, but it's something where you, as a teacher, can go, you know, look, that's not very good, and I look at your submissions, guys, nobody's trying this in like two weeks. It doesn't sound very good, but let me, your scores aren't going to be very good. those few that are, you're not, you're not the ones that I'm talking to you right now, those be good arms. You might be a good idea to spend some time on this day. Because it's not very good and I'm going to be looking for this and then you can break that even further into like, hey, Johnny, that's an excellent part of Shepherd's Hays, little sketchy. And I noticed the last time you turn in a recording, was like a month ago, going to some time with that. Like, that's what I want you to focus on today, or tonight, mean, breakfast or whatever it is. Like, it gives you the information to be able to tell a kid, hey, you really need to focus on this without you having to spend two hours on Sunday to figure it out. Like, you might have to spend some time at the beginning of the conference, or the beginning of the term, whatever it is, to create those excerpts, to identify those things, but then you're done, your thinking is done, you don't have to think about that stuff anymore if you've done it already. And yeah, you might be like, I missed that, I need to be more of this, like, that's nanny. But, at the end of the day, part of what we do in thinking about anything is, I'll kind of my brain, but limited dance with that hat, and as we get older, we realize that bandwidth is more and more limited. And always has been we just didn't realize it on the things that matter How can I focus my bandwidth on the things that are actually going to make my kids better today versus god What was that thing I want to play or what was that extra for what was the scale we were doing today and You can write that down in your lesson plans right before class But it would be a lot easier if you went okay. Here's my schedule for three weeks. We're gonna do this I can't really do this whatever it is and then you just modify little things here and there Oh that section they didn't really need to change that pass off to something else But then you know I did it if I won other thing versus do the whole thing over again, and I'll let you be a little bit more Thoughtable and how you work through your pieces in order to set that up for informal and honestly formal assessment Something else to consider away from mastery based assessment or mastery based learning is this idea of We've all talked about individuals about my groups But had you ever and this is just running out there done something where you took a piece and he said okay Here are the groups I want to listen to and basically make him broadly analogous to a soprano also tenor bass. So, for instance, you're doing a march, you're like, okay, we're have two melody people, one off the person, one like kind of harmonic rhythm person, and one oomba person. And the oomba, and working back and forth again, tubism, printer, and through where it is, create groups, build around the structure of the piece, and that seems pass out that way, because an intermediary between that's not by myself, which is terrifying personal kids, and listening to the whole group, it gives them a chance to, one, understand other parts they might not be able to hear, physically in a room, or just because of their limited awareness, what's going on in music. But two, it allows you to talk about things that are group-ranted, like balance, like, articulation, like cohesiveness, in a way that is not just, hey, you need to think about this when you're doing stuff. It's actually, you can hear what the prawns did there, and you're way behind that, but your part jumps up, and it lets you point to the out in your assessment, in addition to when you put it out in class, in addition to when they realize them and they're listening, so it creates one more contact point for these things that they might not realize your things. And also, for thinking about assessment, like we all can record pretty decent audio on our phones. If you're a phone with a clean microphone, it doesn't right now, it's kind of gross. But if your phone has a clean microphone or you don't want to add ons, like a plug-in mic, you can get pretty good quality audio. You send those five, six, four kids into a practice room, if you have one, where you say, hey, phone will be open or the phone will be open these times after school, you've got to get this done this week, and they submit a recording. Like, that's another way to do this, which if you're thinking about efficiency, this is another way you can be efficient, because you're still hearing the things you want here, and you're hearing them in a context that is authentic to the actual performance for, you know, the things we're focusing on around works. But also, you can hear enough, because there's transparency there, you can hear when that second line-up player is just not ready on whatever those two measures are important. And I did this a lot with March, because I did this with Marching Men first, actually, because my kids were terrified of doing pass-offs of marching men music, even though there were going to be judges on the field. So we created Uncoated Quartets, and we created quartets, and they went and passed off their music for one of the other band runners that I was lucky enough to have, so we could do it in class. If don't have a way of working with you, the recording quality is out there at a high enough level. Even if you don't have something, one of the kids probably does have a phone or something that can look forward at a pretty high level of fidelity. And if we're like, well, okay, that's fine, but that's a lot of time. And your point, is not lost, mean, to the kids even look at rubrics. SCREEN SHARING: Cory started screen sharing - WATCH One of the things I found is that the simpler rubric, the better, but yes, there it is. So can you guys see this, okay? Can you see that there's something there at least so this is from a high school here in Texas that Ariana actually means you might have heard of it, too But Ariana, Lauren, though, L.D. Bell High School up in Dallas, Fort Worth kind of the perennial Texas band if you want to think of that. I'm going to send this to you. This is different old. They called them music performance standards And they became an international baccalaureate school kind of background in country. You'll old saying that but it's true And so they had to kind of raise their game from a assessment and curriculum standpoint and so the music people stepped right up and obviously you think like they did periods like that But like they they made me on top of the more rigorous to in terms of the the way that they approached assessing them and so You know they have this kind of running Scale here on the side of the numbers from 100 to 0 and then they had this very like margin Focus outside for which is you know kind of the thing we come across there, but then into division one class to Division I, which is analogous to what we do here for our state assessment. It's in Division I, it's the best, but it's the worst. And so, but the name of the scripture text, and they bold some of it. So it's like, you know, box one is there is a superficial level of preparation, the most important thing to remember, because kids are probably going, if they read anything, if they read anything, they're going to read the things in bold. And so, like, well, I got a score in this range, ooh, they don't think I was very prepared. I disagree, but, you know, then that starts a conversation, versus I'm going, you weren't being fair. It's like, no, I've heard that. And let's listen to the recording you do that, or play that for me again, and I'll show you exactly what I'm talking about. This gives you a little bit more of an effort. And also, they can't get out of this. You can simplify it, again, like in the 10GPT, and you can have a data to the reading level of your kids. But, you know, things like this kind of middle part of the grading, your comprehension is demonstrated. Errors are almost un-existent for them. That's a score of... 59 to 40, which we know in the grade book would tank against grade. So we adapt it to what we need, you know, like some tools, like you'd be below 70 or like, there's all those things and we can have conversations about how wrong that is. We can adapt this to our needs now. They've done a lot of the heavy lifting about like, what is some good descriptor text? What are some good ways to describe this that are very clear about what he isn't included in this box? And then all we have to do in the teacher is circle a number, or check a box, or something like that, so it's kind of know where they are. And so in terms of getting them to read stuff, yeah, it's one thing. I'm not really to read part of it. read anything, but if you read part of it, at least you're getting something valuable because the bold text, or under how you want to do it, draws their attention to things. So having something like this is not a bad idea. I'll be really honest with you. The large language model AI stuff makes creating stuff like this a lot simpler. You can literally go and I've done this before. I took a rubric from something else at the beginning to adapt this for me into these categories And it basically adapted the language from talking about I think it was dance to talking about music just as if I could and it did a pretty good job I had to go through and edit it and make some tweaks, but it did a pretty good job of being like Here's what an ideal or here's what the top box looks like Here's the top range of distortion It sounded like in terms of the language you used to describe it based on this other thing So, you know, the time consuming nature of this is still there, but it's way less because the blood These AI tools allow us to do in addition You can literally upload this document into any of them catch upt cloud google any of them And it will read it parse it understand it and use it. It's really kind of crazy How good they are and I'll include this in the email that I send you tomorrow Um, but yeah, this is a great place to start I don't think actually I would post all their websites anymore. I saved a copy many years ago when I taught in GFW. It was like, this is really good. And it's changed me a lot of time because if nothing else, I'm lazy, trying to find the most efficient way of doing things. If you want to call that laziness, I would agree with you. But having that too, it's actually for formal assessment, but also for informal. You know, like, guys, was like looking at your, know, you can put it on the board if you have a smart board or something like that and say, look at this. Like, when I hear, here's what I hear. And you start reading up the descriptors and, again, whatever range it is you're hearing. Now, I really like to hear something else like this. And you can use the descriptors where you play it for them on your instrument if it's something that works for them. Where you play them or recording of them doing it better than they did. Whatever it is, it's all dependent on kind of you have. But at the end of the day, you as a teacher are going to benefit from, I'm not playing, but you don't know. But from having a kind of a bank of prepared stuff. you can pull out input where you need it. Think of it like cooking. You know you know you need these carrots and these you know the celery and this other stuff and whatever the Trinity is for the cooking and re-doing. You do that way ahead of time so don't have to think about it in moment. You can just drop it and be done with it. That as far as assessment goes I think makes assessment so much more powerful because you can deploy it without having to wrap yourself up or what it is we're assessing. You can write into doing the assessing because you've done that work of what it is. The kids have it already. have it already and then even you can't hit the crowd running. So doing a bit of prep work and it doesn't even mean all piece. I guess there's something like this is really important. We need to make this sound really great. That might be only thing you focus on for that piece because you don't have time for to think of us. Doing something is better than doing nothing and this is kind of the last big point I'll make is don't let the perfect become the enemy of the good. where assessment is concerned. Your assessments are never going to be part of nobody's own. Nobody's on. There's always going to be some way you could do this and have it more valid and more reliable. That's a thing. We are always improving that. But if we're not doing any of it in way that the kids see as a focus and understand they're being evaluated in a constructive and supportive way, then they're going to get better by doing it. We're just getting the right skills within music that they can then transfer because we're drawing their attention to it every step of the way to our assessment in our instruction. Because there's two things that we set up really linked together. One holds the other almost all the time. Almost to the point that we might not realize that this can choose how much we actually assess. We wouldn't think of this as just doing rehearsal, right? how we run our classroom. But for us, because in the nature of what we do, it can be really powerful. if we just have one way to focus attention within all that stuff that we're doing. One or two things we're focusing our students attention on within all the things that are going on. Because those things are always going to be there, they need us to help them tease the signal from the noise. And often what we're giving them feedback on is what they're going to pay attention to because they don't want stuff plus with them. They want, even if they're high schoolers, they do want to do well. They want to make us happy in some way, shape or form, whether it's to shut us up or because actually like this is, you know, depending on the kid. But three, it also makes our job easier if we don't have to worry about everything to the same level. We have something like, oh, that sounds pretty rough either. We need to spend some time on it. But I really want to focus on our quality of sound in this section. Like, that makes us more powerful because we can go and address four things. But one of those four things, we can go super deep on. And the other three can be things that we'll save for the next time or just need. things we know the kids are going to take care of or are things and say, you need to be of this, but we don't have time to spend on it today. We'll come back to that later. So don't let the perfect become the enemy, the good. But think about doing some prep work as far ahead of time as you have time for, which might not be very long, but so that there is a consistent thread or a consistent sign to your lessons, and to your assessment, and then to the student's experience. @1:04:27 - Lauren Kaminski That's a weird question about rubric. So I tried, I had created a rubric for beginner tests, and I found honestly using my rubric that their scores are lower than if I had just listened to their tests and written down comments. So I stopped doing it, and I just went back to my writing down comments, and then at the end, I would go by and tell everyone what their comments were doing, or sometimes I would do it after they got done playing. This is beginners. After they got done. and playing, but am I doing something wrong in the rubric or is that just something? @1:05:06 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) No, no you're not doing anything wrong because rubrics are set up to reflect kind of the normal distribution of scores. So the majority of score is going to be within one standard deviation of the average just kind of way it works, which often is not something that maps with the scores we want to give kids in classrooms. So, I mean, you can shift that up so that like, okay, you know, what would be a middle box, like the middle of the five unit, a rubric is something in the 80s for as far as the grade goes. And the low and the 70 and the height of the 100, you just kind of collapse that so that the numbers that come out, because at the end of the day, the grade doesn't reflect student learning in a deep way. It reflects proportion, but not everything. So we're going to adapt that to our needs. if you're like, well, kids need to get 80s, because I want them to fail. OK, well, they just want to score up. And the important thing about rubrics is the language you use to describe. And so if, honestly, you're writing things down for them, I would, again, this is me kind of about like, you can do this with AI, but like, scan a bunch of those in and have it look for patterns. What is the thing I talk about the most? How would we set this up as a rubric? You know, this was really good. was really bad. How would I do that? And that might be kind of a workaround that takes what you've done already, if you've saved those, and applies it to your current project in a way that saves you work later on. Because I'm sure you're writing down similar things for a lot of kids. It's pretty rare that you're going to write down something wildly different for one kid than you would for another in a beginner class. And then it's just that we have generally have a lot of beginner classes. You're in Texas, and usually every day or every other day, depending on the school. I know I talk to beginners every other day in some schools, and every day in others, all for like 15 minutes each, which is the We are very lucky in Texas, and I can tell you, talking to the Fine Arts Director, nobody knows why we have to watch him speak in our classes, nobody has a clue, nobody knows where that came from, it's just always been that way. Every Fine Arts Director I've talked to is like, yeah, I don't know, but, and I'm sure glad nobody's fighting it, because I couldn't want to wear a comes from. So, you know, we're lucky there, but yeah, I mean, I don't think you're doing the thing wrong. If you're, I think what it might mean is that your rating scale is out of with what you mean in reality versus ideal. Does that map what you were going to say, Ariana, go and say your ratio? @1:07:36 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) Yeah, I was going to say, that happened to me a lot too, until I understood about waiting categories differently, something shouldn't count as much as others, and something should count more than others, and, you know, in college, when we're taught about rubrics, everything's 54321, and so, when you're marking that off, but that doesn't really line up and that's one, that's the same. The reason I had stopped using them originally was because, like, my kids are all failing everything and then I had to teach a music technology class for a while and rubrics were the only way to create that stuff because there was no hope otherwise I would never get through it. It was so much easier to click, you know, all some are almost some little none. But some things were more important. It wasn't as important that they shared the link with me as it was that they actually added a drum part to their four measures. So I had to wait it differently. And now how I tried that with playing chess. No, because I'm the same weight like looking at that rubric and telling my middle schoolers like they can't get a 95 or higher because they don't sound like one of the finest musicians on their instrument like that's really extreme. So not only I like the idea and I would just have to have chat GPT probably. They just start me with, um, you know, really bring that down to middle school level. I was trying to look up the feeders for the program to see if maybe some of their, like, if I could reach out to any, if I know any of their directors and be like, hi, do you have a copy like this? Cause I know there are also, um, I beat middle schools, um, so it's possible that one of those is IV and that they would also have something similar so that maybe I'll have to do as much. Um, yeah, waiting is a lot of that. @1:09:30 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I categories are weighing forward to especially be a way that it just computationally does it all back in, is really helpful. What I started doing in my final exam in my, my, how to be a band director class is live. It's, uh, so it's similar to what you, you were talking about events where like, I know what they, uh, if they did a written test, that doesn't really tell me as much as I want to know. I want to see how they respond to like, here's a hypothetical, what do you do as a band director? Like, you know, you, you got a bus trip. How do you prepare for that? like that's written, and then here's a recording. Responding that like you're band director. What did you hear? What would you focus on? What would the next rehearsal look like if that was a perform that you were assessing? And I had a rubric, so I through five. But what I do is I literally just color in the box, and the box has descriptor language. went to four as this kind of thing, I put this kind of thing. But I have a score in there, and I just give them a score. It's all fours and fives, you definitely get 89. Because that's what they need to make the great thing go. I'll be honest, this is probably the right thing. You like, I lived on the west coast long enough, and I like, you know what, great? really that big of a thing. Like, it's not 100% accurate, but some people get really up about it, including administrators. So we have to play that game, but it's a game. It's a means to an end. And so the more important thing for me is that they understand where they are, and what they need to do next to get better to move up a box. And even if it's something as simple as, hey, guys, I'll to think about your last playing test. What category did you end up in? You're one, two, four, five, on whatever it is we're doing. I want you right now to identify two things you could do to move from four up to five, or three up to four, whatever it is up to the next level. I want you to take 20 seconds, practice those, and let's play that extra beginner, whatever it is we're doing that day. And all of a sudden, they start to see, oh, okay, there is kind of a method to the madness about that feedback. You're the things I need to focus on. You're the ways I need to do that. And then you can give them feedback. like, said, some of you doing this, that was okay. Here's a more efficient way to do that. So some of you picking your nose, I can help anybody, especially you. You can kind of call kids out, because you can see how to prepare, which gives you a little window into what they might not be doing at home when they're playing their instrument or whatever. @1:11:52 - vince caruso So, some things to think about, things to do, something you wanted to add? Yeah, I was just going to say, we've kind of got, a district, we've kind of got. on a whole hog on the grading for equity thing, there's a whole book, I forget the author's name off the top of my head, but and there's a lot of good things about that. But hearing you say, like I, for a long time, I was like, well, grades and that's really important and let it up. I, a long period, I it. I'm almost like, everybody gets an A, but I'm going to assess you and give you real feedback. Like the goal, like we want to retain kids, it's important that they feel like they're getting better from day to day, week to week, that they feel like they're improving, they're part of the team. But it's, I almost feel like we're creating at times, we're being asked to create assessments or create hoops for the kids to jump through that maybe don't really necessarily help them or it's like we're just trying to check the teacher box of, I graded some things this semester. And really what they need, some targeted feedback and chances to rep things and, you know, the high fliers are going to be the high fliers and the kids who struggle are going to be the kids who struggle and you just want everybody to have this trajectory over the course of the school year not, you know, so, and I have my middle school colleague, Peter is very much anti-grade at the middle school, but he's a great teacher and he's very good at giving feedback and making the kids feel welcome and doing all those important things. So, it is interesting kind of our own philosophies and feelings about the importance of grades definitely factor into how we do or don't address this whole assessment thing. @1:13:53 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) And there are ways to make this, like one of the things about grades that people really can get into is this idea. ACTION ITEM: Assess students in a meaningful way, considering using feedback instead of or in addition to grades, and focusing on assessing important skills. - WATCH that, oh, if I don't have grades, then I get to know how good they are, good they to kids, or how good they are to standards, like, okay, that's fair. So, create different mechanisms. Create mechanisms where it's about, have you passed off all of your major skills? Have you passed off all this stuff? Have you played for another person? Like, this is something I'm starting to explore, is ways we can get kids to be in a mediatory interest. Kids that can, you know, of be in local parentis where it's like, okay, you're a senior, and you've got these three freshmen around you. I want you to go listen to them play this. I want you to give them feedback to reflect what they need to do next. Because all of sudden, like, it's the Richard Feynman technique, if you really want to understand something, teach someone else, get them to address it with other people, and suddenly they're getting better, too, because they're listening with a more critical ear. that has nothing to do with grades, everything to do with peer pressure, has everything to do with kind of the social bonds between kids and who looks up to who and that sort of thing. But it also empowers the kids in a way. a virtuous cycle than one to help others and getting help themselves by doing that, so it kind of makes everything better. But, you know, grades are also a measure of following the rules. Like, that's the big thing I'm trying to address on the undergraduates that are very GPA focused on my look. That's a measure of a lot of things, some of it being your knowledge, some of it being your skill, but also it's a measure of how well you follow the rules of the class that you're in. And that's important in an ensemble because we work together. And so, we do need to have a way to send kids the message of you're not following the rules, you're not giving the things you need to do in a way that is unambiguous. And if everybody gets an A, just because everybody gets an A, okay, but then takes away that tool for us if we want to use it. If we don't think we need to use it, then we don't need to use it. But if we're in a situation where it's like, I need to make it really clear for the four or five kids that just haven't figured it out yet, and this is the only, like, library that says we work for them. And if we use it, we want to use it, and we're really rather not use it. But... I'll be honest, in my undergraduate class, I tell the kids at the beginning, it's hard for you to fail in this course. Here the ways you can do it. Don't show up. Don't turn in anything. Be a jerk. And be uncomfortable. Those four things are probably going to amount to you, not pass in this class. Everybody else is going to pass in class. going you that, unless you do one of those, you're going to pass. the quality of that, that's going to be up to you. And a lot of kids get A, because they do good work. I grade on undergrowth in their development versus like, you have to be this standard of a Texas band director. No. know people like that. know people think that way. I'll send friends into the Texas band director is them. You have to be like them. And I'm not really into that. I don't want to create a close up myself. And so I use grades as a way to show you, okay, you're going to do in these ways. You did this before and now you're doing this now. Here's the grade to reflect that. But then also, you're not following the rules. You're not being a team player here. Here's the signal. That is unambiguous to you. I can tell you. you want this, and here's the grade. That might make you jump. So, mean, grades can work both ways, but I agree with this idea of feedback being the most important thing, a grade kind of being something we layer onto to tick the box that we need to tick for the installation or for the kids themselves that really look at grades as a window to how well they're doing. Do that. the game is kind of a good way of saying it, but like, feed them that information thing so that they can get better with the feedback you give them. Like, here's the sugar, here's the medicine, the sugar is the grade, and you get to grade you're happy. Here's the medicine of all the feedback I'm giving you. So, I think that to me of all the things we talk about in assessment, besides don't make perfect the enemy the good, is the feedback is the most important thing and quality of that and the focus of that and the specificity and the targeted nature of it, but also the way it builds over time. And we're not talking about tone the same way in May that we do in September, and that'll be something we talked about on Thursday. how to kind of make things show up at the end of the semester or the end of the year by how we start the year. That continues kind of the core of assessment, which I know is different than probably what we talked about in undergraduate. Any of us, if we talk about assessment at all, when people are allergic to it. And they don't want to talk about it because it's to whatever. I'm a nerd, so it's really interesting to me. But at the end of the day, it's really simple. Here's what I need you to do. Here's what you're doing. Here are the steps to fill those in. Here's a marker to show you where you are. Here's where I want you to be. Here are the steps to do that. All of sudden, we're drawing the retention of the same thing twice. Here's where you are. Here's where you need. Here's how to connect it. Here's a grid that shows you this. Here's a grid that shows you this. Here's steps to get you from here to there. Here's the scaffolding. It's a really straightforward thing that we, because we are under so much pressure and all this, something we don't have time, often feel like we can't get done in an ankle bed. So just move your goal posts. Change what you need to do. Do less of it. Do it in a more simple way, you know like the thing about that I really like about the doubly belting that I'll share with you Is that it's not Sometimes always and ever It's a here's the kind of holistic descriptor of Distrupters of what you're doing. I think you're in this area And you can break it up of the tone and hide all these things But one of the things that research shows is that we as human to terrible and assessing things in a highly granular way Like the more specific and small we get and the more acceptance we do we actually do worse As far as being accurate to what we're hearing and be consistent over time So it's not like you need to go like you get a sticker and that's the end of the day But it's also you don't need to have like, you know a list of 40 things But sometimes I was never you have to go through and do all that stuff. You have five boxes Like tone is this kind of is this style is this musical thinking is this whatever you want to set it up So that it's easy for you and it can still get something meaningful out of it. So it's funny in that balance. And I'll share some of the reverse that we've come up with in our class that you've been working on this. And as fodder for you to build from, not as something you know, this is the best thing ever. It's their undergraduates, plus their hearts, learning. But they do have some good things to offer in terms of like what places they're from, so that they've done some of the work for you. So I'll send those along too as well. So you'd be getting from me tomorrow, a transcript, kind of liftouts, the video, obviously, the LD Bell music performance standards that paper I told you about, as well as some of the reverse that we've come up with in my classes that I think are useful places to start from. Again, there's like, this should be the holy grail. Now, they're undergrads, love them, they're sweet, they're learning their own. @1:20:49 - Lauren Kaminski I guess I was going to add to what you were saying was, I guess I always just give a grade because it's like if I find it important enough to do a beginner test over it. or to do a pass off. I guess if I find it important enough that I feel like I should put that in the gradebook as that being a grade. Because generally, I mean, thinking to what our grading rubric is, I generally have more grades, so they have more chances than actually what's even in our grading plan. But, you know, I guess I don't necessarily have to give a grade, I could just tear them. But in my mind, it's like, well, if it's important enough that I'm hearing them do the skill then why not plug it into the gradebook. And someone once told me, if you don't inspect it, they don't always do it, which I've definitely found true as well. you kind of put those scales away for a while, know, you get in the throes of UIL and then you bring them back and it's like, oh yeah, you can tell I have not done my scale pass off because they know when they haven't been doing it, because I will, she's not holding us, you know, to, you know, we're not turning those in. But it's That's like an interesting, this was super interesting, of like just getting me some other people get out, but just like whenever he was saying that about the the great thing I was like well I guess I just put it in there because I feel it's important and so I just pick it in the grade book and they just have a lot of chances to like have grades and you know it's not like I'm giving them to assessment grades and they flunk and then grade like they've had multiple chances to you know show skills and and do things throughout the grading period. @1:22:33 - vince caruso I think that's what I've I think that's what I've found for quite a while and I've been doing this for a pretty long time but I find that I get to the end of the semester and I'm like well there's only like two grades like two formal grades in there that aren't performances you know like there's a couple of assessments on literature or a scale you know and then you look at and like well they didn't do very well on those one or two things and now they're having a massive impact. And so it really does come down to, I think, finding ways to do it more consistently without it being the massive time-suck. But because like I said, the kids that are going to work at it are going to work at it. So I don't know, but that's, yeah, I agree. If you feel like it's important enough to assess it, then, and similar thing, like if you don't assess it, you don't know if they've mastered it or not. Yeah. @1:23:41 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) That's the truth. think that's the central thing, if it's measured, it's measured, it's or if it's captured, it's, there's all these phrases, like you said, Lauren, like, you know, if you don't, if you don't, if you don't examine you're not going to know and they'll know you're not going know. so it's a negative feedback loop. As I always need to produce It's not necessarily, but if that's your preference, that's your preference. Like, there's nothing wrong with the phrase. I'm not saying it would bridge your pattern, or you can't measure it, and we can't use them as the end of the all. But I agree, if you're 100% honest, because it's important to us, it says, we can't shut up something to take away from it that is helpful to them. If that's great, that's great. It's a great feedback, it's a great feedback. it's just feedback, it's just feedback. the culture and kind mechanism you want to set up as a teacher, and what you want to have in your program, and what works for your community. Like, what works in Shoreline, Washington, might not work in, you know, cypher, ISD. Like, the expectations of people in admin and the people in the community are different. And that's okay, nothing wrong with that. We have to recognize that. Like, if I was teaching in Washington, yeah, I'd probably still have to make that as mentor, and we'd do country that stuff, but it would look and sound different than what I would do if I was teaching in Texas, or teaching in Georgia, or teaching in Virginia. Just because that's the culture of the ensembles there. So, yeah, I think that's a really good thing. point. And, you know, within all of that too, it's the quality of the information that students take away. And I think it's the most important thing. You know, we have to create grids, great. If we want to create grids, great. It's the feedback and the information, because I think getting back to what you mentioned couple of times, then the high pliers are going to do the thing. And the kids in struggle are going to do the thing. And we want everybody to be improving kind of this way. But to me, kind of that's the floor. That's like the basic, that's the minimal requirement. Like, we always want kids to be doing that. We are going to fix something. But we also should want this to happen. And this goes up the floor raises. And one of the fastest ways I've found to do that is teach the kids how to assess themselves, give them the tools to incrementally get better. And over time, you might have a kid, if you have multiple bands, go from the third band to the first band. Because the fact that they took too big, come the high pliers and they now have tools that didn't happen for them. private lessons help, but that's not always feasible, whether the kid or our program or the child. of the teachers out there, the assessment and the information we give them can't help them with that. So something else I just thought of that I'll add, we actually have in our, in our, in our group of methods class, I have a breakdown regionated into like a six week, like on week one, you do this chunk at this tempo, week two, you do this chunk at this tempo, over time, they get up to performance tempo and have information on how to make things better kids. The name is Albert Lutovar, I don't remember where he's teaching, but he's teaching somewhere in Houston area. A clarinet player actually, he broke down one of the clarinet high school region A2s a couple of years ago. And we kind of decided that he was going to go all in on this, and he did. And I don't know, clarinet, well enough to know, like the really advanced stuff he's talking about is 100% correct, one of, he was one of Chester. problem students. So, like, I'm assuming the automated information is really, really solid construction is a great teacher. But he, like, down to the highest detail like, I want you to do this passage, but play it like this. Like, he had eighth notes, instead of same eighth notes, or he, like, put the broken rhythms, and, like, he did all that stuff for them, so that he could just go, we copy, paste, do this this week. Copy, paste, do this this week. I'll send that along, too. So, you have that, again, as something to work from, as a basis to build on, so you're not having to recreate the wheel. I'll give you the wheel, you make it better. So, look at that enough tomorrow. And then, I guess, those of you that are signed up for Thursday, I'll see you on Thursday, and those you that aren't, I won't miss you dearly, but I'm always here to get an email. If you have questions, or what about something on me, I am at your disposal. So, thank you for taking an hour and a half of your day, just and way over. apologize, but it was really fun. And I hope that it's something. It has kind of been helpful to you out of what we talked about today. @1:28:05 - Lauren Kaminski Thanks. @1:28:06 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Thank you. @1:28:06 - vince caruso to meet you guys.",

Slaton because he probably has a low memory and YouTube miss Prez you have more experience in doing this recently when I was teaching high school it was a different sort of animal and I can talk more about that later but I definitely want to turn over to one of y'all and see if there's anything you can add to that mr. Slaton how would you how would you say that your experience as a teacher has helped you to develop this mindset of having priorities on things such as social life and and your personal life outside of work yeah absolutely you know I this is a topic that I've become pretty passionate about over the last couple years because it's affected me personally pretty greatly I in 2016 after Leander high school went to Grand Nationals for the first time in a while when we were driving back on the bus I vividly remember being like this is it I'm done I'm finished with this after Leander high school just went to Grand Nationals and had this amazing performance and we got six that year I think and like some incredible success but in my mind I had created this unattainable idea that we were unsuccessful because of our placement or because of this idea that I have put in my head that I wasn't being good enough and I think it's something that we've all collectively created in the profession it's not one person's fault it's not a group of people's fault but we all contribute to it all the time it's just this chase that we're going to talk about later that like we're all trying to chase this unattainable goal this unattainable level of performance and then we see one band get better at something or we see this other band do something different and now we have to do that now we have to get better and it for me my priorities were misplaced and that's when I realized that I wasn't doing this for the right reasons I would always say that I was I would always say it's always about the kids I would always say I made decisions about the kids that we are here to develop life skills and we're here to do those things but I hadn't actually looked at my decisions as a teacher and gone am I actually making decisions for this program that are benefitting the students in their experience first over my ego in my desire to want to win things and I think there's nothing wrong with being competitive I think there's nothing wrong with driving kids to want to be competitive and wanting to win stuff I don't think there's anything wrong with any of that as long as it is not your motivation for what you do it's this idea that like if we've all been a part of it if you don't get a division-one or you get a 1 1 2 at UIL you're a bad teacher which is so ridiculous there I my second year of teaching I got straight twos across the board because I programmed really poorly and I wasn't a very good teacher back then and I didn't make great decisions but it doesn't mean that my students didn't have a great experience or one successful and so I think we've all kind of created this and specifically the Texas band world that the only way that you're going to be successful as a director is if you get division ones or you win honor bands or you make the State marching contest where you win Grand Nationals and that's absolutely ridiculous because that's that's just simply not going to happen for every program regularly every single year sometimes it'll happen sometimes it won't and so go to going back to the original part of this you might have to saw me I like to talk a lot especially about this topic but no one we love it I in Tracy I had written up my resignation letter and I was gonna quit I was gonna be done it's my second year have had ban directing at Leander High School and I called my mentor Nick Williams at UNC and I was like hey this is I can't do this anymore it's way too much time there's too much pressure I'm not happy I'm putting in all these hours and like and he was like Robert like the reason why this is so miserable for you is because of you and your ego and if you know anything about Nick Williams you know that he's direct and very transparent about the way that he feels and he was doing that in a very very nurturing way for me to basically say if you would just make this about the kids and make your decisions for your program about their experience first you were still going to win things and you're still going to be successful and competitive but you're gonna start to view the way that you teach differently he's like there are so many people around the state to say the same thing that want to get up and quit and we have all these young teachers that are coming in that what I worry about is that they view someone like me or Joni or our programs as we work until 10 o'clock every single night and that's simply just not true it there might have been a time when I was an assistant when I was doing like that because that's what I thought was necessary but now that I have really really made some changes for myself in my program I before Corona happens I was going home at the end of my sectional I would literally go in my office at 5:30 at the end of my section I walk out the door and I'd leave and I still get all my work done and I still answer all my emails and my staff still does their job and we're still successful but we had we needed to start making changes because here's the deal I work with is Ryan Serna who's one of my associates and he has two kids and a wife and he should not be at the band hall until seven eight nine ten o'clock at night because we need to answer emails for for students that are emailing us or parents emailing us like that's not that's simply to put it and I don't I don't want to sound bad here but we don't get paid enough to do that and it's that doesn't mean that I don't care enough and it doesn't mean that I'm not doing enough for my students and I go home at 5:30 and I'm doing plenty and I think that's the part like that I get kind of passionate about is that we all look at these programs and go like well that band or band director works till 10 o'clock every night and they do listenings for every single kid every single week and they're up there at 6 a.m. in the morning doing listenings until 7 p.m. and nowhere in there to me does that sit there and go well what about your head drum major who is we were an IB program on our campus and who's an IB who does a zero hour class who's going to your master class before school then there's zero hour then there are four classes then they go to your marching band rehearsal that goes for two and a half hours after school then they go home and they eat and they have three hours of homework and that to me is not like a sustainable life for a high school kid and I started realizing I was contributing to that by making the decisions for my program that was just simply asking too much for kids and so our discussion here is we before I know we're gonna get to talk more is that I had to set the example first with my life for them to see that I can balance mine and I can have a social life and I can have friends and I can take care of my family and I can exit out of the band hall when I need to and I'll kick them out as well so they will see the example that I want them to see when they go out into the real world for them to exude when they go out in the real world and so we've made some really positive changes I'm excited to get to talk about tonight that have actually made our program better and more successful because we've done less time and ask less from the kids so sorry that's my schpeel I went word so I I have a question for both of you actually both mr. president mr. Slaton as the person is no longer in the classroom on a secondary level like I did the band wreck anything for eight years but now I'm up at college where we just I don't know talk too much you both kind of mentioned in different ways about these drivers of why this is like it is the the push for success the chase I think you called it mr. slaton and you both are incredibly successful in high high high highly functioning ensembles and I don't mean that like high functioning in any other way then your students can do a lot of things and they do do a lot of things what do you think some of this obviously self-imposed like we want to continue to push forward and be better than we were the previous time but are there other drivers you think that have contributed to why this is this kind of keeping up with the Joneses that we all see that which were these students have experienced and we've seen as teachers over our careers well I think a lot of people that go into this perfection profession and not all but a lot of people that go into this are type any to where we are perfectionists and control freaks at least about certain aspects in our lives and you know if that if you know that you're kind of a type-a personality I think that that can contribute as well to how you approach the job and and how you're prioritizing and that personality can definitely get you in trouble because that idea of trying to be perfect everything you do can be really really dangerous and so I think that's part of it what do you think mr. Slaton yeah I agree with that as well and I do want to say that you know when I when I study here and talk about UIL and tme a Honor Band and State marching contest I I'm not saying that those are bad things that's definitely not it for for me it's more of those things have created how we teach every day in the classroom that that is what we gear our teaching for to give you an example they had to set and establish a rule on tme an honor band that you can't start before December 1st because people were playing that music all the way through marching bands and it's crazy to me that somehow you've manipulated music education into this idea that you play three pieces of music for five or six months at a time and that's all the kids get experience it's three pieces of music for five months until you perfect it and you might not even advance at a region or area and to me that is not that is not music education like that's not an experience that your kids are enjoying sitting there doing that I think they're for me it kind of developed I guess over time and the reason I say every one of us have contributed to it is because I think it's just slowly evolved into what it is now and I'm not that it's a bad thing Texas bands are amazing I mean I you know Mike Howard over at Vandegrift one Honor Band and he did that in three months he didn't play it for that entire time and they sound brilliant there they're amazing it's great but to me I think it's like how it has evolved you know I don't want to speak for dick Floyd because um you know he is kind of the Godfather of UIL and all of that stuff and he's an amazing teacher and he's wonderful he was in my band hall just two months ago but you know I think when he established all this stuff back in the day and he created all of these this UIL system and what it was I don't think his intention was for it to turn into what it is I don't think that's what their driving force was I think it was let's establish like what the evaluation is let's just like a standard a standard yeah and people were making that standard but I think now what it's turned into is it's it's more of you are successful if you achieve this thing and now you must do everything you can and your teaching and your sectionals and your daily class in order to achieve these three division ones or six division ones that you get at the end of the day when there might be 25 people in the audience watching your band perform what the focus is I'm not saying that people do this wrong I think some people do and I think some some people do it right I think UIL is a great thing I think what it's created is awesome I think having a standard is really important thing getting evaluated and hearing from professionals is super important you know part of what we do part of performing is competitive good if you're going to perform you're gonna go out and get a job somewhere that's a competition you know like we we have that environment but I think where we have to look at it differently is how do we teach every single day in the classroom about music first and the experience first and educating the students about music in order to achieve those things not I'm gonna sit with a trumpet in a trumpet sectional every single week and I'm gonna pop the metronome on and just beat notes and rhythms into kids over four months until it is correct how about instead teaching them how to play it correctly so that way when they get a new piece of music they can do it on the first or second try instead of taking four months to do it does that make sense absolutely and would you say that like the fostering of the relationships that you have with the kids how you foster those relationships generally has a direct impact on how they work for you and like the buy-in that they have when it comes to working on whatever it is you're asking them to do let's say you do decide to to only take three months to work on that UIL music do you think that's important that your relationship with your kids is in place in order to pull something like that off at a high level because you are dedicating less time to it yeah I think absolutely absolutely I'll give you an example please don't think anyone out there and I think Joni could say the same thing like the reason I talk about Leander so much is because it's the only place I've ever worked so I'm not sitting here saying we're the end-all to everything we have a lot to work on still and I'm very lucky to be there but you know we made this change four or five years ago when I mentioned that I was thinking about resigning and I sat in the office with my colleagues and I said all right guys like I'm either getting up and I'm letting someone else to take over this program or we're gonna make some changes that make this experience more positive so if you could have the program that we have with the students that we have the support we have from our district the amazing parents the money that we have from the booster program and the in the district if you could take all that and erase all the expectations what would you do with it what would be the things that you want to do and what we ended up deciding is we wanted to play more repertoire we wanted to bring in more people to come give more experiences to our kids we wanted to do master classes and have more groups come and perform for our students and so we still wanted to do UIL we still wanted to go to State marching contests we still wanted to do region all of that stuff but what it did is it allowed us to make some changes that actually were kids centered and we asked the kids we surveyed the students and said what do you guys want in the program even to the point of there were sections on there that said mr. Slaton is he trustworthy like we got feedback on everything and the number one thing the kids said aligned exactly with our thoughts which is they wanted to play more repertoire and they wanted to have more experiences with other teachers other than us and so we decided to add a concert in February and then chain we we were like we're gonna try this and see if it and we did a full concert in February and then changed our program for UIL and it gave us like six weeks to get prepared for UIL and amazingly we figured it out and all the groups got their ones and it's all all great everything's fine but what was cool is that the kids because we put trust and ownership in them in their learning and we put ownership in their practice they knew that they had less time so when they came to sectionals they were more prepared because they're yeah they stepped up exactly and so when they saw that we were making it about their experience they started giving more back in return and they performed at a higher level honestly because they were putting in the work at home rather than us doing it for them in sectionals I think it's really interesting like that that's the paradigm you guys took because it reflects kind of the stuff we talked about in psychology where it's intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation that idea of you know we're gonna sit in a section we're gonna pound the notes in new year and play this right and not know any other way to play but the correct way is that extrinsic motivation that's being forced by someone else to do a thing and it sounds like you guys were I'd strongly doubt that your program was that before you guys made a change but you've shifted it over to be more intrinsically oriented where the students have more ownership where they have more motivation they're their peer motivated maybe like there's a little bit of like well they're doing it so I need to do it - both of you have talked about this relationship component being an important part of this and to me this is kind of what I was spinning my wheels on earlier that increases efficiency in the same way that if you guys think about this idea of distributed computing there's a thing going around now with kovat about folding at home where you can set your computer to basically solve problems look for ways to fold different proteins to form vaccines basically it's like it's turning all the computers that are just idle into a supercomputer so you're taking this the central the centricity of the director driving the bus and turning it over to the students more so that they're the ones that are now driving the bus and you are steering it you're going we're gonna do this thing and they go okay here we go and they suddenly have ownership in a face and they feel valued in what they're doing there's a actually wrote of paper a while ago about this idea of autonomy within ensembles and how it's a tricky thing to do because we have a product that we want to get we wanted to look like X Y or Z and that could be it my experience was my ego saying I need to be able to play you know flag of stars at a really high level would get a1 and Ida similar sort of Paul and there Saul on the road to Tarsus moment as you did mr. Slayton I mean I know you've had moments like this to miss Perez where I I realize is like this is more about me than it is about the students and I really need to reorient what I'm doing to make it sustainable for me because I can't keep up this I can't lift the world on my shoulders I'm that atlas I'm not gonna let pick it up and just move it around and also it's not serving the kids needs in terms of their development musicians and their development as people and that's important because we're in the business of teaching children I made a reference to Tiger King earlier and I'm sure some of you watch that show and some of you have not and some of you would be shocked by watching it it is a train wreck of the highest order but the the thing I thought was really interesting was the last line the show spoiler alert he's in jail but he talks about he talks about that he he didn't treat the animals right it's basically what comes down to it like he robbed these two Apes of being together because when he put them in a wildlife preserve they wouldn't hug each other and they had always been in separate cages for ten years and he goes did I rob him of that he said yes I did because I got so caught up in having a zoo I forgot about the animals now not that we're talking about animals in zoos but the analogy I think ports directly over we get so wrapped up in having a program or you know getting a one or winning and winning a contest or all those things we suddenly forget about the people that were actually serving for the students so I mean it's it's just really interesting to hear that cuz I matched perfectly onto this extrinsic intrinsic motivation paradigm and how much more powerful intrinsic motivation is especially when it's socially mediated in that the students reinforce that between each other versus it all being down from a director it starts moving this way and those relationships that miss Perez Brent referenced are the key tie that really moves that forward yeah yeah you go ahead go ahead sorry I was just gonna say I'm sure sorry I keep saying Joanie miss Perez I am sure that you have had similar experiences and the years the things don't go as well as we would expect or we don't get the result that we want it's funny like it went for instance it was like three years ago in 2017 we got like 14 that do a Santoni or something and we were all devastated oh my god like what happened and we got on the bus and the kids right when are we getting pizza everywhere we get to go to CCS I mean wouldn't we get to do that exactly it's not a big deal to them like sure of some of the disappointed but like when when our focus is that like brief moment when the guy announces your name with the placement and a score if that's what we're digging everything towards then we've forgotten about the 99.9% of what we do and like the the fun part about band needs to be what we do every single day the 99% is rehearsing like every time that we're in a rehearsal like that needs to be the enjoyable experience that's when the kids need to be invested in what we're doing and all of that work is gonna the byproduct is going to be being successful and putting on successful performance I don't know if you feel the same way in this Perez but I've had those moments a lot oh yeah I mean and and I think kids are the same everywhere - you like what you're saying when whenever we're just devastated about something like we've we let it consume us in a way that allows us or that keeps us from you know understanding the reality of it is okay this was a disappointment it's not the only thing that matters what did we learn along the way let's emphasize like the journey that got us here maybe it ended up this way because of this maybe it ended up this way because of that maybe we don't ever know those answers but this is what we learned while we were getting there you know we try to get them to recognize the experience that they created with each other on the way to that that destination they were moving towards and to find some of that meaningfulness you know in and what it is that they're doing every single day so that that end result is not the end-all be-all it's what they're realizing they're how they're growing together and we have to learn how to do that as directors - you know - to be involved in the moment right to be with them and present with them every day through that process you know it we get so just so like this warped sense of like dr. mr. slaton said earlier I've gotta this I've gotta that if I don't this than that and I'm not gonna lie I've had those thoughts go through my head quite a bit where I tell myself if we don't this then people are gonna think that if this happens this year then we got to make sure X & Y Z happens next year and so you know if you do find success then you've created your own monster of trying to like one-up yourself as well and like I've said to people before and like when we won the national championship back in 2013 frickin great right I mean that was amazing but I I typically say it was the best worst thing to ever happen to our band program and you know I won't get into like all the details that cause me to say that but um you know I've had years since then that have met in fact I've had quite a few years since then that have meant way more to me personally then that year did that year we caught lightning on a bottle and it was amazing but you know there are times where you're gonna have a way more meaningful experience and not end up being as successful as you first sought out to be and if you're not able to you know see the forest of the trees in those situations sometimes then you know you need to kind of step back and re-evaluate I'm thankful for when marching season ends every year because well first of all you need a few days to just like go through the fog of just letting it just letting it end but that's when we finally get to actually have a real conversation with ourselves about how we want to move forward it's difficult to do that when you're in it right I mean would you agree with that mr. late and while you're actually in that process you know stepping back and looking at it it becomes more and more difficult to further into your season that you get the closer you get to UIL the closer you get to State marching contests your area or whatever that is no I agree I think that you know one of the reasons why when you contacted me something that I thought I wanted to talk about was this is because I think what I would started worrying me is like am i setting an impression for young teachers or other people running their programs that this is what you have to do to be successful and I didn't want to be a contributor to young people not making this a career I think if you look at the number of directors out there like there are a lot of young band directors that are teaching high school and middle school band because so many people get in it and then they burn out and they get out and do something else and this needs to be a career like we need to be able to allow this to be sustainable and not create something that is unattainable I was gonna say you know to wrap it in because the people that are here all about to go out and into our world and and begin doing this teaching and for all of you here like I don't want you to misinterpret maybe some of the things were saying like obviously miss Perez and I are very competitive as far as the high school band stuff goes and and we want to be or I can't speak for her but I know for me like I want to be competitive and I want to be successful but what I finally decided was it will never be at the cost of my own personal happiness or my students happiness and I had to set a line there and if that means that we don't win stuff anymore like that needs to be fine with me that needs to be okay and it is if we get sixth instead great we're gonna celebrate it's gonna be awesome show it's gonna be a great year if we get division ones and we don't advance the area on Honor Band like great at least let's make some great music so the experience is great so point being like for you guys that are coming into this I think that if if I can employ two things one like your own mental health and your own balance of life is more important than winning stuff and getting division once it just simply is it does not make you a successful band director to win things that's not what this is about what makes you successful is if you students are gonna remember you ten years from now they're going to come back and visit you or if your students are going to play their instruments when they walk out at the door when they go to college even if they're not going to be music ed majors or there's one kids life who you changed through the process and we're able to support them like that is what this is about that's that is what should give us meaning along the way can you be successful and when stuff great yeah absolutely you're running a great program sure it's great it that would be number one take care of yourself first the second thing I don't for you too is just make sure that whatever decisions you make I'll always start with is this what's best for kids is that it like number one are the kids getting the best experience out of this as possible if I were a student sitting in that chair is this the number one thing that should be happening it doesn't mean that it always has to be fun because being good is not always fun sometimes beat down and sometimes it's really hard work as you all know you've practiced your instrument at some point and it took a long time to get really good and that's not always fun it's not fun to rehearse marching band every single day it's not always gonna be fun so we don't want to live in this you know inflated or this rose-colored glasses world but there is a way for you to make it about the students you know I I had the good fortune of marching in the Cavaliers during a time when they were pretty successful I marched 1997 to 2001 and taught there Oh to 206 and one of the things that strikes me that you were saying mr. slate and I've heard you say before to miss Perez is this this orientation towards student experience and what it's like for them to do the thing there was a gentleman who was the assistant corps director in the car guard captain internet named Bruno's Ookla who's a elementary educator in Butler Pennsylvania like not inauspicious but he was the reason why that core from 2000 to 2008 really was a dominant force in the activity because the entire orientation that I experienced was it's not about the product it's not about the score it's about the process we used to get there and the way we do things is going to create the opportunity for those competitive moments but there's so many factors that go into a competitive success that we don't have control of that pinning our self-worth to that is a losing proposition if that's the only thing we pin it to like I can show you analyses have done where every judge at DCI San Antonio is correlated with the every other judge at a hundred almost a hundred percent they're all ranking everybody the exact same way which is weird in a contest of twenty one cores so there are things happening though that we don't have control over necessarily so if we pin ourself worth of that it's it's setting up a really bad precedent and if we pin the student Southworth or the student experience to getting that score getting that placement we miss out on so many opportunities you both have highlighted beautifully the entire way through here and it gets this idea of neuro chemicals actually this is gonna sound kind of random but like there's - baby there's like four that we fourth I do we have bouncing around are the two big ones are cortisol and dopamine cortisol is a stress response and dopamine is a pleasurable response you eat chocolate you could dopamine you get yelled at you get cortisol you eat chocolate and you are getting yelled at it's all confusing and what the one that that is responsible for this connection and this is shared experience dopamine thrives on that it's like it's it's it helps build that it's almost like frothing over the edges and these negative experiences where we're just where we want to raise our score and we have to do this and then the other thing and we're driven by fear and driven by anxiety is cortisol and that's just it's it's a non-starter it you can't sustain it it just goes away and the will to do things goes away and that's where we get students that burnout students want to not continue for a lot of reasons but I will tell you in my personal experience teaching at U of H we see a lot of kids from the woodlands come down and they still play their instruments whether or not they're a music major they still play their instruments in marching band and concert bands they're around they do things they're still involved and that's to me a huge mark of success for a band program and for new teachers coming out the first thing you guys want to do is prove that you know how to do what you're doing right you want to show that you know the thing you know how to how to play the game you know you deserve to be there you're trying to banish impostor syndrome and that's totally normal we were all there once too like my first year going to UIL it was the say it was the third year that any Indian Springs was open it was the first year that the varsity band and I conducted went to contest I had 21 trumpets in that band I had 400 bows in that band I don't know how we made any sounds that were remotely sensible but we did and we got once and I felt really good but then it was like that was like yeah and then the next day is like okay so we're gonna play scales again right or do we get to go get pizza like the priorities I have we're not wholly shared by my students and that starts to reveal to you okay there's more going on here it's more about the people than it is about the product and I think getting back to your point mr. slaton about how uija wasn't designed to do this but it seems to have created that I think the thing we see especially now in social media is we see the product we see the people getting the ones we see the people posting their videos from say marching contests and those are great we don't know how that sausage was made we don't know what the process wasn't so Sara Lee unless we know the people and so we start to idolize the product we started I've got to get that thing but I don't know how and that creates in misaligns our incentives and creates a lot of different processes to get there that maybe aren't as healthy as if we were able to and I don't know how I don't answer here able to focus on the process creating the product or creating the context whether the product should be what it is and I think so much of what we do in our success we don't realize actually comes from our own personal happiness and our own personal like balance and joy in our own lives and how that actually does affect our teaching my good teaching is one of the only things that like we we are putting on presentations every single day and kids are relying on our words and what we say every single day at every single second I you know I connect a lot with what you're saying about porcelain double mean I read this awesome book by Sean ackard called the science of happy and he does this awesome TED talk out there you should go check it out it's really cool and he talks about all the research he did on happiness and what it does on the brain and what he's talking about with the cortisol and everything is like the synaptic cleft in between your brain that connects both sides of your brain every time you have a negative experience it works like a muscle and that it just keeps firing on electrical currents every time you have a negative experience and what it ends up doing is that's where your brain is shifts and you only see the world through that version of yourself so it's like the people you know in your life that just complain all the time about everything or the students that you have the complaint all the time about everything it's because that is the their environment in the world they live in and that's all that they can see that's their natural go to is to go to that place and I've started personally realizing like man when I come to work I'm not happy like I'm not enjoying walking in the door and I teach it one of the most remarkable places in the country why is that it's not the students it's not the place it's not it has to be me and I started putting more focus on myself in my own personal happiness and Worth and started viewing that differently or doing things that would make me happier and more relaxed prioritizing my own time prioritizing my family and my friendships and what ended up happening is I started enjoying where I was going every day because I just started looking forward to it more in my interactions with my students and my decisions were starting to be made in a way that were more positive and they were geared towards more of their success and I couldn't do that until I personally had figured out my own balance and when I was over working and when I was focused more on the results and I was constantly unsatisfied with what we were doing even though it was amazing I was not happy and I was treating the kids in a way that was less respectful or less about their experience and less about my positive interactions and relationships with them so I totally connect what you're saying I'm listening to what you're saying there about like had you had to come to this realization and what I want to say everybody up to out there is no we're having this discussion today because you know we want to try to help you before you hit a wall or before you have to go through something traumatic to get you to this point of realization of this balance that you need to find I will be super honest I've had two pretty traumatic things happen in my life over the past several years that have had to give me a wake-up call and you know it going all the way back to when I was an assistant I would be the one I was the second assistant when I first started there were three band directors at the time there's only two now so that has all so affected how we balance things around but at the time I was the second assistant and I was the one staying every night I was doing staying until eight or nine o'clock it was me it wasn't in the other ones nobody told me to do that it's what I decided to do myself for whatever reason I had to do this so how did that I was trying to be all things to all people you know I was a female on staff when at a time where there wasn't a ton of females on high school staffs and so you know I felt a duty if you will to kind of make some things happen that weren't already happening and I felt like I had to do a lot of the things that people weren't even expecting me to do I put that expectation on myself and so I created these really long hours for myself as an assistant and when I became a head director I continued that foolishly and all this stress I was putting myself on gotta get this done I gotta do this gotta do that and I would actually spend more time on something than that I actually needed to and I didn't realize I was doing that until I blew out my ACL when I was skiing back in 2015 on Christmas break we went skiing and I hurt myself and and it was pretty bad and so I had to miss I had to go through three months of physical therapy after my surgery so I missed about two weeks of school and then I had to miss three conference periods a week to go do my physical therapy because that was the only time that I could do it and of course I'm panicky makes I'm like oh my god when is this gonna get done when is this gonna get done I'm not gonna have this time but it's love and you know what it actually all still ended up happening everything still got done everything still took place the way it was supposed to and it wasn't because anything miraculous happened it was just that when I had the time that I was given I was more efficient with it and I used that time more effectively kind of like with the eight hour rule in Texas you've got to learn how to use that time as efficiently as you can so when time is done like you're not doing extra and so I realized that was the first time I realized after about mmm seven or eight years that I didn't have to spend every waking moment of my conference period doing email or I didn't have to stay an hour to after sectionals scheduling this contest because it still got done my mindset was telling me though it's not gonna get done unless I do it this way alright so that was the first really traumatic thing that happened to me ever since then I learned from that ever since then I've never I it's it all changed for me at that point now most recently about two years ago I had a really personal thing happen in my in my life that was incredibly traumatic and and I I realized that that happening was a direct result of the prioritizing I was putting on my job over my personal life and you know that was a neat thing that happened over time it didn't just happen overnight but I ended up making my job more important than my family I ended up making my job more important than my marriage I made my job more important than you name it and nobody asked me to do that I think that's something we all have to remember here is nobody's asking us to do those things but that's just something that end up happening over time where eventually it really caused some major problems and I had to have some serious wake-up calls to realize you know this is not the most important thing this should not be the most important thing yes it's important it can be important but but there are other things in your life that you must keep at the center in order to remain a human being right so that when you do go to work the kids see that you're in a good place they see that you know you're not constantly like this dark cloud or stressed out and and they respond to that right so how you are choosing to involve yourself in your job and the way that you handled that it's gonna have a direct effect on how your students end up responding to you as well and ever since that last traumatic moment in my life took place you know I've had a much more enjoyable time at work with my colleagues with my students because I got to that point where I had to reshift I had to rebalance I had to recalibrate right and I hope that that doesn't happen with you guys it sounds like mr. Soleil did you you had to take a step back and you were able to kind of see that for yourself but I don't want something traumatic to happen in y'all's lives for you to be able to to get to these points of realization and I know I just talked for a long time but that's near and dear to my heart that that is near and dear to my heart because I I do have some very personal experience with like having to have all the stuff hit the fan you know before making a change and so I make sure that like thank you for being so brave to say that because I think example that this is happening to a lot of people and I think at the end of the day like you have to make a decision like when when you're at the end of your career or you're at the end of your life like do you want to be able to say that you got 36 years of division ones or that you had this like incredible marriage or these incredible relationships and friendships and created this beautiful family you know like I I mean I think we all know what the right answer is there but sometimes we we don't always drive our decision-making behind that and we're we're all at fault to that like it's it's not that you like it it's one band director or another like we all do those things because we're all competitive people and we all want to be successful and have that desire I think that you know - for all of you that are sitting here watching us like we're in very unique situations and it's I think some people would hear us me and mr. Prez say these things and go well isn't that easy for you for where you come from and where you teach it must be nice having all these players that can play their instruments so well and you have all this money it's like well yes there are things that make our job a little bit easier so we can be that but what we have also done and I think what's cool about our similar experiences is we we were at programs that weren't established and we helped establish them and turn them into what they are now which is really cool and when I first started at Leander like the program was not huge it had gone through a bunch of openings in the district that it pulled half the like Cedar Park open and pulled half the campus Vista Ridge open pulled half the campus then rouse open and pulled half the campus and it's slowly just start diminishing and then there was not my boss Neil Gunderson he's awesome but the previous person to him unfortunately did some illegal stuff and it destroyed the program and a bunch of people left and there it was in a really bad place in what we had to start to figure out in the last several years like we're talking about here to make balance of our life more of a priority is we had to all equally take on the load as a director team in order to support each other so I think like to connect it to what you guys are about to go out and do like there are ways that you can make your job more efficient in ways you can be more organized and things that you can establish in your program they're gonna allow you to do less let me give a couple examples here and then maybe we can all kind of round-robin here so one of the things that I started doing on my campus is we do not all lock up together we do not all open together we do not all travel all together one person does it every single day so you always have your lock up day in your opening day so on Thursdays if that's my day I open the band hall for whatever is happening in the morning or before school and then I close after rehearsal at night and all the other days I literally walk from the tower and I walk straight to my car and I Drive home because my assistants do the other stuff and the same thing for like Friday night football games or competitions we all equally share the load and so I'll take my car sometimes to be away Austin if I'm not locking up that night and I'll just get in my car and drive home at the end of the evening rather than having to come back I know there are so many programs that everyone always everyone's always there always till the end of the evening or everyone's there at the beginning and think they have to be there and they have to be the first ones in the door answering their emails and then I I wish it would be cool to have balance rather than being cool to be able to say like well I worked until 10 o'clock last night like cool like like that means you're not efficient actually ya have to work that late well the same thing comes with the people that were you know I had a hundred fifty emails in my inbox yesterday as a badge of honor it's like that just means you don't manage your inbox well that's what that tells me and I think I think the good thing is with this generation the ones that we're talking to today is that you guys been talking to the people here under the age of 25 you've grown up in an environment where this is becoming a more common part of the conversation like I know when I was younger back in the 80s and 90s back when dinosaurs roamed the earth and you know velcro was still a thing we put on her shoes the air fall care hey what I think I'm the oldest person here I would be surprised if I wasn't the this conversations are not about this they were about results they're about getting that one or winning boa and I grew up in bands of America my father did timing and penalties from before I was born for boa he's the white haired guy walking across the front sidelines of grey Nationals up through like 2006 so I've seen marching band in its expanse and it's just grown over time bigger and bigger and bigger and with that has come has not come a conversation of keeping balance like mr. Slaton's talking about it what miss Perez is talking about and what I experienced as a head director that conversation wasn't as prevalent as it is now so you guys are going out with actually a better toolkit for when not when the excrement hits the air conditioning but before you can stop that from happening and allow yourself to go okay what do I need to change how can I avert this bad thing from happening based on these conversations you're hearing us have so I think you're actually set up in a better place to be a lot more sanguine I guess would be a good word for in your job then maybe we were set up as a generation of the generation before us was set up in a more rigid way than we were so it's gradually you know the arc of justice bends towards truth the arc of health bends towards mental wellness and hopefully we're kind of helping you make that transition that's cool yeah you know I I think if you're sorry Johnny I just again maybe this is a good topic you know I I think that one of the things that I always when I was a young band director is that I would try to do everything on my own I would try to figure things out on my own and think that I had the answers and that would cause me to spend more time in the band hall or rather than just asking for help and more importantly my point being that I didn't really have mentors when I was a young band director in my first four years my boss was had like three kids and in like two years and was balancing his life and wasn't able to be there for everything that I needed all the time and I wish I would have sought out and found a mentor and I think my encouragement for a lot of you guys here your mentor doesn't have to be your headband director it can be anyone but I would just encourage you like if you don't know how to be efficient if you're staying there till 8:00 9:00 10:00 at night it means that you're not doing it right that is a sign that you're not actually being efficient in your job and you should probably find ways to ask other people like hey how are you doing this like a how are you organizing solo ensemble in a way that you're not having to stay up here forever and do these things like how are how are you hosting UIL and not having to stay up here till 10 o'clock at night like what are ways you were doing that or hey my band is not getting better and my attitude is poor and rehearsals and I keep doing the same fundamentals and they keep staying the same over and over again you should go seek information from people or have a mentor and not be shy to like send your concert band rehearsal to somebody that you trust I just had this conversation with Robert herrings actually just a couple days ago and we were talking about the best way to get better is to put yourself out there and send videos to people of things that are at their worst and he's like man I'll get so many people to email me and say hey would you be willing to listen to a video sometime and he's like yeah sure I'll do it there go but we're not ready I'll send it to you when you're when we're ready it's like well no we want to hear you when you're bad like we want to help you in January when you're still working on your music like that's when we want to help so I would encourage you out there like find that mentor find someone that's going to be on your team that can do that for you that can give you advice and help regularly so I don't like we've we could talk for hours on this as you can tell and I and I you know it's not really like a really great place to add in like hey let's do a QA right now because this is flowing you know to a lot of different things but I would love for you guys if you guys have a question for us type it over in the chat open up your chat and and put it in there we when we wrap up here in a little bit I think it would be a really good time for QA but I want to see if y'all have any questions as we kind of continue to move forward through this and if that means we need to go back to something we can do that but we definitely want you guys to be involved with with trying to learn you know as much as we can offer while we're on here so just put your chairs questions to the chat if you have any and we'll get to them as we keep moving forward hey Joni I have a question for you yes it might protect this what do you wish in your first two or three years of band directing not a head directing but like being a first year teacher what do you wish you would have known going into band directing that would have helped you with maybe this particular topic or something you didn't expect what do you wish you would have known that you could go back and do differently or would have asked for that's a hard question I could spot no it's fine I mean I talked about it a little bit already just this idea that in order to be successful you have to stay at the band hall for X amount of hours a day you know there's people that we've all heard of that have done that and and you know what some of them have some really amazing programs but you didn't you didn't you then T sorry you didn't speak to some of the students in those programs and you get the sense that you know even though they were really successful a lot of things they weren't really getting a holistic experience and and really the the super like positive experience and nurturing experience that that they wanted to have and so like when you come into these jobs somebody mentioned it earlier you you start to idolize these programs that you see be really successful over time and like dr. aamil said you don't really know what it takes to make those things happen and it's different at every single program there's no right or wrong way to do something but when I went into my job you know I had idea of you know well I guess I've got to be up there late in order to to make sure that this is successful you know if I'm not getting a one from all three judges every year at concert in sight-reading then I'm you know a miserable and failed or fail you'll failed band director just kind of those preconceived notions that you have going in that you know if you do this then this and the fact is this is just not that's just not the reality of it I'm looking down at some of the questions here yeah there's some good questions yeah you know if I could I'll speak to the first Landon's where are you still here Linden Lisa van people bailing out okay there you know the one thing I learned to be more efficient and whether or not it was effective I don't know because there's efficient and effective they're related but not always was turning more of the work in ensemble over to students in terms of self assessment and their ability to analyze what they're doing I did it I did it in a very characteristically nice sort of way because I'm I overthink things a lot if you couldn't tell already I took Adam Smith's on the wealth of nations the the book that capitalism is based on a lazy fair capitalism and there's a section in there about dividing responsibility within a assembly line squared Ford got his idea for the assembly line process and what it is I put four things up on the board and I said pick one of these four do and this is your responsibility evaluate yourself this way and I let them say okay give yourself a thumbs-up thumbs-down just kind of distributed the responsibility and that made the ensemble more efficient and more effective because they got better faster because it wasn't just me and they were waiting on me to tell them what to do it turns some of the responsibility over to them now these are seventh and eighth graders who were in the second band so the things I asked them to do were pretty simple like is your sound staying the same are you making a good sound is your articulation the same on every note that it's supposed to be like those kinds of things very simple things but all the sudden I distributed the load of listening to the students in a way that gave them a little bit of ownership in what they were doing and also made them accountable for what they were performing in a way that it wasn't if they were waiting on me to tell them what they did right or wrong so that's one way I became more efficient as a young director Joanie do I have access to share on the screen I do write a share screen it's a green arrow old man is figuring out how to use technology okay do you mind if I share something here to answer one of these questions not at all okay let's see which one do I want to share which question are we referring to what we do this said mr. slain you mentioned that you're able to leave the band hall right after sectionals what are some of the things you do important to you concrete things to ensure you're able to leave on time feel guilty about this and then examples of how you've helped your student teacher students balance and their personal lives at schedule so can everyone see this screen can you is it showing my lesson plan here yeah yep so one of the things that we established at Lander that has helped of time is our use of technology and communication to the students we use Google classroom for everything even to the point that we actually don't print out music for the students ever anymore so I'm never copying and scanning music ever think like I'll scan it at first and then just post it on the website and say hey we're playing Shostakovich five everyone have it printed out by this date we started establishing that process rather than having to do all this extra stuff like staying up and printing and copying parts one of those big things is that we started just being more efficient with our lesson planning so everyone knew what they were doing all the time we would walk out to so many rehearsals and I think this happens in a lot of places especially when I go clinic I noticed this that there is always this idea of like I don't know what I'm doing right now like a student perspective like I walk to rehearsal where am I supposed to be set up where are we starting are we starting in chart blah are we starting in arts are we starting in split warm-up and it would just be this idea of non-communication happening that there was a lot of confusion and chaos so we started organizing as a staff and then our drum majors realized that we had this awesome lesson plan that was going on and they were like hey can you share that with us and so then we did and they were then they knew where to set up and where to start rehearsals they knew what they were supposed to be bringing to rehearsals in any given time and then our section leaders were like hey our drum majors are getting this awesome lesson plan that tells them what to do can we get that shared as well and then the students that we're not sexual news we're like hey hold on why don't we have this awesome lesson plan like we could just go there and so what we do now is we create these lesson plans that I'm sharing with you that we post on Sunday and I I will fully admit I spend several hours on this on Sunday which sounds counterintuitive to what the discussion is but this planning ahead of time saves me so much time I don't have to stay after to worry about tomorrow's rehearsal I don't have to stay after to worry about as many behavior issues and emailing parents because the kids are they they kids crave like expectation and clarity to stuff they want it and then when they don't have clarity when they don't know what they're doing or they don't know what the expectation is that's when they start to figure it out on their own when they start to divert and behave poorly or make decisions that aren't proper and so what we do is we communicate all of this stuff so if you I'm gonna scroll down here like - so here's Monday's class so mister Serna knows that he's gonna be splitting with the woodwinds working on all of these things all these tempos saying all of this stuff and working on these things in each of the parts I'm going to be doing a brass split here and then if you go to after school stuff like kids can see like hey the Xbox was which is our alternate group are you gonna be here facing the trailer they're gonna be working on these things this director is gonna do it then we're gonna have everyone else facing the tower on the front 50 sideline we're gonna do this so now everyone knows where they're going at 4:45 we're all gonna be in chart 55 so like the kids have access to all this stuff and it looks super detail because it is but it allows me to not have to make up stuff on the spot it allows my staff members to know where they're gonna be and what part of the field they're gonna be on and where they're gonna be assisting so now people aren't walking up to me right before rehearsal asking a billion questions and making things chaotic and making me stressed out and then I get frustrated my staffs frustrated and we get rid of all of those things which makes it so much easier and then at the end of the day we can just leave and everyone knows what they're doing tomorrow in class we don't have to stay up to figure that out as a staff afterwards and go what are we gonna do tomorrow it's just been done so I dictate this right now and then these guys go in and they fill out their lesson plans if I'm saying like woodwinds are gonna do this woodwind feature in the opener I don't fill out what they're saying I trust my staff to go and fill out what's gonna work for them in their lesson plan so I'm not doing all of this this is done collectively as a group and then what you don't see on here is that we'll share this with the drum majors and they'll actually put in the plan Ethan is in charge of setting up the speaker on the 50-yard line blah is in charge of encouraging kids to get out the door faster blahs in charge of doing attendance for the woodwinds so like that's all organized from their standpoint and every kid gets access to this so that is like a tangible way that you can help save time and make your world a little more efficient and that allows a lot of that other stuff to go away you'll be surprised about how much better it gets this plan efficiently yeah I'd like to add to that so like what he was saying earlier yes that is very involved and it is very detailed and it does take a while to put together but if you are if you just decide to dedicate time every Sunday or every Monday to what your weekly plan is gonna be like when you get into your job you know you're gonna have sectionals all week you know what your schedules gonna be go ahead and sit down just bite the bullet okay I'm gonna spend a couple hours plan this all out get it on paper you are gonna have such a peace of mind after you do that Kyle Witte and I both teach to bands at The Woodlands and so we're both doing two full bands a week plus sectionals for both bands it's insane and so we're having to find how to first of all schedule all that but once we figured that out we came up with this scheduling template that we both fill out every Friday before we go into the weekend because Friday we don't have sectionals right so we spend a little extra time on that Friday and we map out everything that we're gonna do that next week and even though it takes time then we can put that away for the weekend and go into the weekend knowing okay I know what my plan is next week and I don't have to stress out every single day about what's my plan gonna be what's my plan gonna be when the kids asked what piece are we gonna start with you can just look at that piece of paper and tell them this is what we're doing it's the same thing with the marching rehearsals so even though it might seem like counterintuitive to sit down for an hour two hours three hours to map that all out it's completely and totally worth it because you're gonna you're gonna see that over the course of the week or the month or whatever that plan covers that because you decided to put in that time everything after that's gonna feel much more what you're just gonna feel better about it because you're gonna know what to expect your staffs gonna know what to expect your students are gonna know what to expect so that's that's one way that you can alleviate the stress not just on yourself but you know your students and your staff when everybody sees that plan ahead of time think about it like compound interest for your mental health so you nestled on yeah you spend the two hours but that two hours compounds in terms of the benefits confers upon you two and three X as you go through the week because you're not having decision fatigue about what do I do next what and you're not having to think on the fly there's a certain point where your brain just goes done not doing it anymore and then you start producing you hit the point of diminishing returns so it's all about that investment putting the time in the bank early to make the decisions and you went after just one or two depending on what happens during the day I'm sure you've both experienced that as presidents just laden but that you have the the structure to work from makes it a stronger process for you and converse so many benefits on your mental well-being yeah these plans rarely stay on time rarely at least know what we're doing and when I do say okay we're going on to the next thing everyone knows what they're doing and this includes all the texts that are coming to rehearsal they get shared on this stuff too and I put in there Aaron Sanchez Tech is gonna be with the trombones today from chart blah-de-blah and here are goals so when we do all of that or just be more efficient with our time and I think for you guys that are first-year teachers you're you could probably look at this and go okay well you're the head director at Leander High School like what if my head director where I work doesn't do stuff like this and that's that's absolutely like a a concern to have so then what I would say is on your end of things is encourage this ask for this in a respectful way and say things like hey is there can we sit down together and figure out what tomorrow is and I'll write that lesson plan out for you so we can be more efficient tomorrow and just put it out there because they're likely if they're not doing that stuff they might just be overwhelmed it's not we don't want to do it they probably just don't feel like they have time and absolutely this thing can assist with that and help take that stuff off of their plate you see their stress it's likely that they just need some help and they need you to step in so I think that's the place you can do it and do it for all your concert band stuff all of your sections you do this exact same thing for all four of the concert bands and we combined all the lesson plans into one gigantic document together so we always know when I'm splitting a class for the third band I always know where I'm doing it and when I'm doing it and it helps me manage my time so I go oh I'm not splitting today in that class that's a time for me to sit down and either go out and help in his ensemble or go answer emails or have meetings with parents that I need to so it helps you be efficient in that regard and then you'll see that your teaching is just more efficient because you're your plan and you're ready to go think about sorry I'll be I'll be Portland you go I don't get it but okay it's did he do it the West Coast after you so my assistant Kyle when he first came on you know when you haven't you realize this too when you hit bring somebody new onto staff and you need to keep this in mind as a new director joining a staff that head director also has to kind of figure out okay how is this new dynamic gonna work and who have you know are there different hats these person people are gonna be you know learning how to wear and that takes a little bit of time so just keep that in mind but I remember you know Kyle would just start saying this is a way that you can help something like this he would say what are you thinking about working on a rehearsal today and most of the times when he asked me that like I was just my brain was just so full of things and it's like I knew what I wanted to hit but I I didn't know how long I wanted to spend on it I didn't know you know what page that was specifically so I would say well there's just one you know the The Ballad where we learn how to blah we definitely do hit the jazz running in the closer there's this fundamental exercise that we really need to learn it so I would just spout like general things off like that and Kyle would write would put those things down and then he would create a little schedule right that had all those things in it and just be like how does something like this look and I'd be like oh my god I love you because he articulated that for me and then I could go in and say you know what let's add five minutes there let's add two minutes there and it's not that I couldn't have done that myself it's that my like my brain bandwidth sometimes I don't have enough and so you as an assistant director can look for those opportunities with your head director of alleviating some of that pressure just saying you know ask a couple of questions and see how you can take that information and turn it into a possible helpful plan right and that became what he did that just became how we operated after that and it was great like I would just get to say okay these are the things I want to hit and I would ask him the things that he wanted to make sure that we did because he did our visual and he would come up with a plan and then he would go over it with me later and we kind of modify it now and that's a work approach now we're talking about like socializing right we're talking about like there's things that you can do as a staff to stay healthy as a staff by doing things together outside of work like we haven't really talked about that yet but you're asking like how can I foster these things as an assistant director well if you come on to a staff where you know you notice that like there's not much time being spent together outside of the office that's a great opportunity for you to suggest hey I was thinking there's this new restaurant that just opened you guys want to go and grab a bite after rehearsal and just like throw little opportunities out like that sometime to timing you know what they may not buy it right away they may not they may not go for it right away but if you keep trying to try to make those things happen that's another way that you can help foster like a our team environment and a great relationship with your staff and maybe infuse some of that into this new staff dynamic that maybe was missing before because you're gonna find that if you're if your relationships with your staff are healthy then you're gonna have more fun going into work right I remember there's years where I have so much fun going into the work into work and there's years where I I regret or I've dread it because you know the dynamic was either super healthier or not healthy for whatever reason it's very healthy now I just want to put that out there it's very healthy now um but that that has been a case sometimes and I think and I've noticed that there's a correlation between how much time you spend together outside of the office not saying you need to spend all your time outside of the office with your staff don't do that but there is a correlation between spending time with them outside of the office or let's get off our computers and off our phones hey let's just talk about what we did this past weekend right and talk about something that has nothing to do with band set aside time like that because that is super super important to maintaining an office healthy mentality as well when we lunch together I don't allow any of my staff members to talk about band the entire lunch it's very difficult for them I was also gonna add I think that that's awesome I was gonna add looking at some of these other questions here I think Corey mentioned this earlier giving your students responsibility to take ownership over the program is another massive way to save time on your end let me give you a couple examples of things that we do we at Lian derp don't do anything on Friday nights the staff we don't do anything the drum majors run all inspection the captain's run everything for getting onto the bus and off the bus and getting in lines before we go into the stands they all set up everything we do inside the stands when we go to any particular stadium they run all the football games stuff they they pull up all the stand tunes they conduct the school song and fight song we train them how to do all that stuff in the beginning of the year and it's the process now that they train each other now which is cool and so when I'm at football games I can just like take care of if there's an emergency or a kid is sick or a kid misbehaves or whatever it frees me up to do that and it allows me to not have so much pressure and stress that's going on and what's really cool is the kids want to do that stuff like they feel like they get to take ownership over all these cool things that are happening the section leaders are running the inspection process with their squads because we split up all the students in squads of six to ten people per Section leader so now not one section leader is overwhelmed with stuff they just get to take care of their group of people so we've organized it in a way that's logical so everyone's involved in that process that also goes along with a lot of our kids teach the fundamentals during summer bands because we can't just do it on our own we'll always introduce the information then we'll split off and have them do a ton of teaching so we trained our sexual manners how to teach our drum majors and our captains how to teach so they assist us and that stuff and a lot of the students will take on organizing a lot of our large events like banquet or even hosting UIL and posting all those things like we will give them the information to meet with them and then we ask them to put that work in and they want to we're not asking them for more time it's always volunteered if kids don't want to do that stuff they don't have to volunteer for it but what's cool is I kids like taking ownership in the program because they feel like they're invested and they get to have a say in the direction of what it is and they'll want to work harder for your program when you allow them to do it they'll make mistakes they're gonna fail all the time and you have to be okay with it and then you guide them and you allow them to fix it from there and you're always there on their team but if you don't allow them to do that stuff you're always gonna be trying to do it on your own and you're gonna stay up there till late at night then you're gonna have all this extra work that you're supposed to be doing when a kid can just do it for you that was one of them and I want to add there was also sorry I have a train that goes right by my house that's that loud sound five feet from my houses there was also this other question that was asked here like what are ways that you show your students to have life balance everything I think one first and foremost you have to show it like you have to lead by example number one that has to happen and two you have to be respectful and understanding of their time it's something that we decided to do is do no more region band master classes we don't do them anymore our lesson teachers do a lot of that stuff in their lessons and we do provide smart music assignments if kids want to do them but we stopped doing 7:30 a.m. region band master classes before school during marching season because it was an insane amount of time we were asking of our kids and what was really cool is our region been numbers actually went up when we stopped doing that stuff because they were like oh I'm not being forced to do this anymore this is something I can do on my own and once marching band was done we still did listenings with them during classes and stuff and we would provide help as much as we could but we took that time off of their plate and gave it back to them and they they saw that as a sign of respect for them and for me that was like okay our numbers might go down and here in the next couple years they still might go down as possible but it wasn't it wasn't to me more important than the kid having balance and being able to do other activities they want to do besides bands it I just looked at the amount of time I was asking of them and realized that it was too much the same thing for sectionals and not just for your students but for you yes like everything you're asking them to do you're doing yourself sometimes tenfold depending on what the scenario is and how many kids are involved you're doing two ensembles you know like I mean that's the amount of time just for sectionals alone I'm sure it's crazy for you guys well and I I think something to kind of bracket for everybody listening right now is the stuff that that we're talking about scales up and down like many moves Perez was talking about how to how to introduce this into a place where it doesn't exist was about helping distribute that load by going you know what do you think about this how do I do you started to take on as the assistant some of the things that you would want your students to take on in a different orientation where you go can you guys take care of a inspection block can you take care of loading the bus or getting kids on the bus doing all these things we distribute down but we also pull down items from above us and distribute them in and do our wheelhouse to help carry the load it's all about everybody sharing where our skills overlap and where we have the ability to do so and I think it's really interesting that all of these answers have come from an orientation of coming to the problem with a solution coming to the issue with some way to make it better and that I think answers some of the other questions too like you know I bring this up with the director how do I find out if a director is open to this bring a solution to them I know when I was a head director Yuans ago I was in a much smaller school than Leander or The Woodlands and we had a lot of kids that were just stretched super thin they did everything it was one of those schools and every time I would get overwhelmed if somebody brought me a solution of hey what do you think about doing it this way I'd be like yeah I did I had the exact same erection - mr. president like I love you you're amazing you're the best person ever let's see what we can do with this but then also to what mr. Slaton was saying about the students failing personally I'm a big fan of failure as long as it's productive failure if this if they feel the same way twice then you're not near your job as a teacher but if the students fail better the second time then they're growing we only grow through failure actually I shouldn't say we only girl our strongest growth comes through failure and not big failures like you know your car is totaled and repped around a tree but like I screwed that up I dropped the ball there the next time you come back to it with the regular reinforcement for music teacher that soon is gonna be a stronger contributor to whatever it is they're doing because they learn from that experience and they went I'm never gonna do that again I'm gonna do take these steps to make sure it doesn't happen and all of a sudden that link to become stronger and then this kids that they train they get to tell them hey don't do it this way because I screwed up once and I got yelled at so here's how you do it better and so it just builds on itself and that's the great thing about all of these is they're self-replicating and self-sustaining if we approach them right as the teacher you're a facilitator to knowledge versus the arbiter or the fountainhead from which knowledge flows in these situations which i think is a powerful thing to realign your your brain around especially as an undergraduate where it's all about knowing things for you right now is everything that you know is your calling guard and that's great you have to morph that then into how can i facilitate student experience to get them to know these things - rather than just tell them and that's tricky you guys are really smart I see kids court Corey had III in their first session I said everybody you're gonna pick up real quick that he has a way of articulating things in a way more sophisticated way than I do and all my undergraduates have just been rolling their eyes for the past there's a couple other questions over here that I wanted to draw mention to and and I know that dr. Mills mentioned this in a text reply or a chat reply but Jonathan you asked the question about how could we get an understanding and provide a look at that one that Jonathan posted I'm glad you asked that because I was actually going to suggest that that's a question that you asked in your interviews we talked about introduce the other day and this didn't come up but when you do have your interviews and your potential employers looks at you and says do you have any questions for us I think that that is an incredible question and very thought-provoking question for you to ask because for one thing it matters for another thing it you know it really challenges them to articulate what they're doing to to create that balance or you're going to pick up on the fact that they don't have a great life work balance and that's an important thing to know going into a job now that doesn't mean that you know that won't be a great job to go into because there we've been talking about ways that you can infuse some more healthy things into those kind of situations but you might pick up that okay this person is all about staying at the band hall from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day and maybe that's not what you're interested in so you might pick up some things from the answer to that question whether it's it's it would be helpful one way or another so I would definitely ask that at the end of your interview um there's another one here I was just gonna reject remember the interviews as much you interviewing the people you're talking to is them interviewing you if there are red flags and it's an amazing job you're like this is you know Valhalla everyone is happy here and there is no wrong that has done in this building but you're getting major red flags that's not a mark against you you that you're there's something wrong with you it just means there's something there that doesn't fit what you want or bring to the table and that is okay that is not the end of the world the year you viewing them as much as them interviewing you you want to you want to try to you're not gonna get to necessarily choose where you work but you definitely want to and don't think that that's that's gonna happen you normally know get to just choose oh I get my pick of the litter doesn't work like that but you you do want to be able to look into into that staff dynamic and kind of get an idea of what that's gonna be like right yeah um so Austin oh you're the Austin's is the last question in the chat and I read that and I was like ooh that's that's huh I have an answer that I mean it's not like a go-to but I think maybe this helps me um I think that it helps when competitive directors that compete against each other I think it helps when they become friends and they develop a relationship together to where like that person becomes human to them right you're all looking at we talked about this earlier you're looking at these programs from the outside in and you kind of get this idea of whatever that program is or about but you don't really know what's behind it and that could be the same way for directors you know we all have these perceptions level this school it's got to be like this like everybody thinks the woodlands has everything don't get me started okay like don't get me started the people that are on this chat that work with us you know so everybody has kind of these perceptions of what every school is about and what it takes to get to the point that they're at when I when I get to know a director from another school and get a little bit more insight into what they're doing or just get to know them more as a person it's it's it helps me I guess just be more okay with those competitive moments right like if if you know such a such and such group ends up beating us well I'm still gonna be disappointed but that person is my friend so I can't be like that mad about it you know what I'm saying so that's one way to try and keep the unhealthy part creeping in I don't know if either you guys have something another approach that you take I want to piggyback on what you just said in bragging my bit about my own district just a little bit because I think that a lot of people from the outside as well look at us and go oh my god like they're so competitive with each other and everything and yes that is true let me give an grift as an example one of the most amazing banned programs that exists right now you know we've been going back and forth for four or five years with Vandergriff competitively in the marching band realm we'll beat them one year and then they'll beat us one year and then we'll be at the boa Austin and they'd beat us to San Antonio vice versa whatever it is and this year when that happened we beat them as something they beat us as something we need them and something just kept going back and forth and when they won Grand Nationals this year I went down to the field and exactly what miss Perez just said is like I have I'm really good friends with my coward and we hang out regularly and we work together at sassy over the summer and I was in KD Van Doren's wedding I was her husband Evan Van Doren's one of his groomsmen and when I got to sat there I sit there and watch that moment and I turned around knowing they're about to win and got to watch and observe them like I had joy in my heart for the group that just won and beat us and it allowed me to like separate that and go like look at those people like look at look at their success and they're enjoying it that's cool that'll happen for me too and it has before and I want to make sure that just like miss Perez is saying like when here in Leander ISD like we are competitive with each other but we regularly all hang out with each other all the time we're very social with each other I I regularly have the Cedar Park guys come in and ask and help me out wait and I'll send them videos or send them concert recordings and ask them to help me the same thing with Bryan Christian and read over a Vista Ridge and Jason Robert rouse like it's there's such a willingness in our district that it feel it takes away that pressure that the competitive side is the most important thing and we all love doing well we all love that and I love beating Vandegrift it feels great when we do it sure but it's it's not it's less about that than it is about you know the the winning part it becomes dish more about like being excited for their success and they are excited in return for ours I agree and the other thing that I wanted to add to that for Austin's question here is that I think it's a daily thing I think I think it's constantly reminding yourself why you're doing what you're doing and I watch all this simon Sinek stuff this leadership stuff I'm sure some of y'all have heard of him before but he talks a lot about like why we what we do being at the center of your focus for your decision-making and if you don't know why you're doing this then you need to stop and reflect and you need to figure that out I know when I went into this my why was I loved marching band I want to do the marching band thing I loved playing my saxophone and I want to go like be a musician for those reasons it was my personal success which was the Y which I don't think is a bad thing it can be like it can be a way to launch yourself into this but then you have to remember that you're working with teenagers or younger and you have to remember that you're creating an experience for them that you got at some point and I think for me that's the why now it's like I want to inspire one of my kids to have the experience I had in high school so maybe they don't want to be a band director one day or maybe twenty years down the road when they're a rocket scientist and have a bunch of money they'll donate to a band from somewhere and maybe that will be their why I mean I think you just have to read reassess all the time and constantly remind yourself when you're getting anxious or you're getting angry or you're getting stressed stop and go why are we doing this are my decisions about the kids are the things I'm about to do have to do with their success and you'd be surprised oftentimes in rehearsal like when you can feel yourself getting stressed out I'm sure the two of you guys feel this too like when I get stressed out and worked up and I can tell my voice is raising all like consciously stop and take a breath and then I'll find one kid doing the right thing and I'll praise them and give me a wheel in front of everyone and the whole rehearsal changes like that and everyone's like oh mr. Slaton's happy okay great yeah we're doing great and then all of a sudden the vibe changes in my life and I think you have to find those moments to reset every once in a while yeah I would love to build on that what Austin what your question presupposes is is this looking across like looking at each other side of what everybody else is doing and one of the things that I use as a guide is it's never my place to say this person has more than me it's my place to check and make sure they have enough and if that is that then then we're fine I don't need to compare myself beyond to make sure that they're getting what they need now to the competitive like this side of things when I get into those places and I mean when I was marching the Cavaliers i won DCI five it's twice as a performing a burn three times on staff I had a lot of success there and it was really really cool and I'm never going to tell you that winning is it great because it is it's awesome but at the same time the thing to remember there is it's not about comparing yourself these other people because you have no control over what that ranking is past a certain point your preparation is young that prepares you and that starts to become looking at yourself up and down am I better today than I was yesterday is my group better today than it was yesterday last week in the week before so instead of this horizontal focus it turns into more of a vertical focus as you build and that to me is a healthier place to be it's hard to get to you sometimes especially if you're competitive but it's a healthier place to be and it's a better mindset to foster and yourself and your students that if we're better today than we were yesterday then we're doing the right things we need to keep doing them and progress is not exponential like we all know what exponential growth is now thanks to all the stuff that's going on progress really works that way until the very last minute when it just explodes so it's gonna make all hockey sticking before that it's a very slow burn and if you go my better today than it was yesterday at some point it's just it'll hockey stick but if you don't spend that time getting slightly better and that's that vertical focus it it might not ever it might just a flat line you might flatten that curve in the way you don't want so I know where we're getting definitely into dinnertime and so we're gonna we're gonna start to wrap this up and we can talk on this forever it's an important topic and it's something that you know it's not something you want to think about just right now you're gonna need to be self monitoring yourself you know every once a month every six months you know whatever it is you need whatever job you end up being in to stop and do an evaluation of where you are with all of this and if you don't mind like since we are talking about mental health and and just trying to keep a healthy mindset just a few things like in closing for like right now since you're not actually in the classroom this would be just you know living in this Cove in nineteen era mentioned this on the first couple of sessions like I imagine some of the some of the you know things that you guys must be feeling and thinking right now having to deal with the uncertainty of things especially you know graduating and and not really knowing what the next step is but you know there's some things that you can be doing just to try to keep yourself more centered having nothing to do with with that part of things just first of all are you are you monitoring how much News you're watching right now you know I can tell you right now like when all this stuff started going down I was glued to the television for like the first two or three days and I'm I had to realize like that's not good for me I have to I can't do this anymore I'm gonna check in like once a day for maybe like 15 or 20 minutes and that's about it right so I would encourage you guys to to to monitor your consumption of news media right now because it's insane everything that's going on out there at the moment um if you're not trying to get outside get outside and enjoy it you know we've spent a lot of time about a lot of time talking about the amount of hours you spend in the band hall and don't get us wrong you're gonna spend a lot of time in the band hall but right now you have an opportunity where you don't have a ton of obligations and just kind of get out there and try to calm your psyche a little bit as you're living through this time of uncertainty the color green is scientifically proven to to calm you it's it's it's a soothing color and there's a lot of it out there right now and the weather is beautiful lately so I just want to encourage you guys to try to do some things outside you know when it comes to work if you want to if you want to look at how you can apply this to getting ready for the job it's a great time to focus on creating some great some great applications and resumes right you don't have the distraction of actually being in student teaching for 8 hours 10 hours a day you could sit down and dedicate some time making sure that you're ready for these interviews and for submitting these applications and feel really good about it right be really thorough send those to some people have them look your resume and and you know make sure that your references are in check what some other things you guys that they could be doing to just kind of keep their own like sanity right now my don't read it get off reddit and that's a big one yeah office so social media as much as you can I saw your one here exercise habits I think it's huge I don't think everyone has to be fit but I think that there should be something you do that allows your body to move and be active right now I know for me that is something I've had to adjust because it's it was shocking for me in these first two weeks about how much I was sitting down in this chair and staring at a screen and it started to get to me and I was like I just need to get outside and walk my dog or hang out and I would encourage you just find something whether it's just walking around your neighborhood or you know if you go running or whatever just try to do it as regularly as you possibly can I think that's awesome and like connect with people you love I've allowed this moment to be like I've been like FaceTime with more family members and it's been really cool and started to develop stronger relationships with people I don't normally talk to as much of my family so it's been really neat I think you just take advantage of the time because it's never gonna happen again in your lifetime likely that this is going on right now we sincerely hope I would add to that do you something that to go back to like a Stephen Covey sort of thing fills your cup and sharpens your saw for some of you might be exercise some of you might be getting you know getting back in touch with your family in a different way there are lots of silver linings to be found in this whole awful situation this very very sad situation that we're in there are silver linings that exist so looking for those and writing them down every day I know I try and do when the the I have three children under five in the house so this doesn't always happen but when I can find the time I do like mourning pages where like that write down one thing that I want to be grateful for that day one thing that is bothering me that I need to solve and one thing that is going well and then I just kind of like brained up everything else for a while that helps recenter me um another thing too is meditation is a big thing out for a lot of people or faith just like reading the Bible or working through Bible verses are doing a small group session there I'm personally much more into meditation and there's actually a bed apps out there you can download if you don't have one already 10% happier waking up oke calm headspace is another good one too if you are interested in that if you friend me on Facebook there's a post I put up that'll give you a free month to an app called waking up I got named Sam Harris who is a neuroscience PhD and it's a great app for building mindfulness as a habit which helps with all this stuff too so just find something that feels your cup is really important because if you don't do that you're not bringing your best self to any situation you come across in any circumstance but especially not now with everything that's going on around us I shared that link you might have just seen on the chat that's that TED talk I was talking about with Shawn Acker and the science of happiness I encourage you to copy and paste that before this thing gets done and go check it out it's 12 minutes and it is hilarious the guy is so funny but it's some really cool stuff a lot of what Corey was talking about myself as well like a that's where I stole a bunch of that stuff to be honest with you well and as I mentioned before we record these sessions so if you want a copy of this I actually I stopped I forgot to press record until about 10 minutes in but I got I got most of it um if you need this for any reference just let us know we can get that to you I know we talked a lot there's so much to share on all these topics and I hope I hope that you know you guys were able to take some meaningful things from the conversation probably not every single thing you know you can relate to or was applicable it's applicable to you but hopefully there were you know multitude of things that you felt like you know can contribute to this mindset that we're talking about is you enter the profession because it's probably going to be the most important aspect of of your life when it comes to making sure that you are successful in the ways that you want to be so thank you so much to dr. Mills and mr. slated for your time and we want to thank you y'all for your time as well thank you guys yeah we know you still have a lot of things going on and we wish you all the best and let us know if we can help you in any way you know how to reach me and dr. meals and can definitely get you in touch with mr. Slaton if necessary so don't have a great night in a great weekend and stay healthy thanks so much",

Key approaches include creating a supportive classroom environment where mistakes are normalized, using incremental learning steps, and providing focused practice opportunities. Allowing students autonomy in problem-solving and using varied incentives to increase motivation were also highlighted. Connecting musical content to students' lived experiences makes learning more accessible and engaging. Recommended resources for further insights included \"The Art of Learning,\" \"Make It Stick,\" and \"Intelligent Music Teaching.\" VIEW RECORDING - 70 mins (No highlights) Key Takeaways * Beginner music students often struggle with frustration, perfectionism, lack of focus, and difficulty transferring skills when learning new concepts and techniques. This can lead to shutting down or giving up easily. * Building a supportive classroom community where mistakes are normalized and students feel safe taking risks is crucial for their learning process. Peer support systems can be valuable. * Breaking down complex skills into incremental steps, providing focused practice opportunities, and celebrating small successes help students progress without getting overwhelmed. * Giving students some autonomy to problem-solve challenges independently or in pairs before intervening as the teacher can build their confidence and skills. * Using varied incentives and rewards that motivate students increases their engagement with effortful practice and learning. * Connecting the musical content meaningfully to students' lived experiences, interests, and existing skills makes it more accessible and \"sticky\" for retention. Topics Discussed Challenges Faced by Beginner Music Students The participants shared the common challenges their beginner students face in learning music: * Frustration and shutting down when unable to immediately grasp a new skill * Perfectionist mindsets - if they can't do it perfectly, they get discouraged * Lack of focused attention and excessive talking in class * Difficulty transferring skills across contexts (e.g. across strings on instruments) * Immaturity in independent problem-solving, expecting constant hand-holding * Struggles with combining or building on previously learned skills These challenges are likely exacerbated by factors like high teacher/school turnover disrupting consistent culture, student exposure to more mature content through technology, and changing student mindsets in the post-COVID world. Effective Strategies to Support Student Learning The educators discussed several promising strategies to facilitate beginner student learning: * Fostering a supportive classroom community where mistakes are normalized * Explicitly teaching routines for peer support and collaborative problem-solving * Breaking down complex tasks into incremental steps for scaffolded learning * Using varied incentives like food, rewards, and games to increase motivation * Allowing students autonomy to try solving challenges before intervening * Making musical concepts \"stickier\" through repetitive practice over time * Connecting abstract concepts to concrete skills/experiences students already have * Meeting students \"where they are\" by understanding their specific entry points * Framing the classroom as a safe space amidst external chaos Recommended Resources Cory recommended three books that provide research-based insights into how students learn: 1. \"The Art of Learning\" by Josh Waitzkin - Discusses strategies like spaced repetition and incremental learning 2. \"Make It Stick\" - Explores principles like effortful learning for retention 3. \"Intelligent Music Teaching\" by Robert Duke - Applies cognitive research to music learning specifically The key is understanding it's not necessarily the musical content that needs changing but developing effective pathways to make it engaging and accessible for today's students. Transcript @7:08 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay so speaking of doing things today we're gonna talk about this idea of student learning and kind of all the different ways it lives but talk about it from a perspective that recognizes what we bring as teachers and what our experience brings but also who kind of points our attention to other ways to consider learning or other ways to think about unpacking learning for the kids that already learning it for the first time or are experiencing challenges in their growth and that sort of thing. So you know the first thing and we all know this is that all growth especially learning is non-linear. like it's not an A to B to see the sort of situation with any kid, you know, if we think back to all the teaching we've done, how many kids actually do the build on the old skill in a really clean fashion across time? Like I am very few. And those kids tend to be just kids that are naturally gifted, but they're not very many of them. We're teaching more, should be teaching more to like the two thirds that are easily captureable, easily like if we tell them these things, these things will turn into the kids doing stuff really well. That's part of the what I call the magic words philosophy or like, oh, don't say soft, say, you know, whatever, like there are people for whom like the specific language are used is really important. And in some cases, in very much is. But and this is the crux of the issue here a lot of what we kind of think and bring into it can cloud our vision actually what's happening with the students. And what they are and aren't picking up on that we're laying down. And so, you know, this idea that we have to create this perfect learning environment actually might not be the thing that serves them the absolute best. You know, I've taught with people, I've done it myself where we kind of, we sit there and go, you know, my kids can't make mistakes. Mistakes aren't an option. And one of the things that we'll talk about today, but also just kind of in general, is that actually mistakes are one of more valuable things in the learning process as long as they are scappled in the same way, like we talk to our kids about making better mistakes. Don't make the same mistake over again. Make a better mistake next time. And that is actually, research is starting to show kind of what we all are experienced is, is that we learn best by experience and we learn best by that sort of granular understanding that comes from doing the thing. And then. anything else from that maybe doesn't really work so well so we're gonna cover little bit of how we adapt those skills and adapt the things that we ask our kids to do based on our deeper understanding of what it is we're actually asking them to do so I guess the first question I have for either of you is what you know when you're thinking about learning like one of the things we think about are the challenges to learn and so like what are some of the challenges you see in your classroom that are either present enough they come to mind first or were memorable enough that they come to mind first I would say kids just getting frustrated like beginner specifically you know it's like they can't get the task that day and so they get frustrated and then they shut down so like how can I do something else in order to make them like not shut down @12:00 - Lauren Kaminski And, you know, keep pushing the other kids because, you know, sometimes at that point in the year, you have your kids that are up here, you have your middle, and then you have your bottom. And so sometimes it seems more often than not, it's the bottom that is getting frustrated. And so how do you keep the bottom? Like, hey, it's okay that you, and I will say like having Mario, like he kind of taught me, like he would tell the kids like, hey, it's your first time doing this. Why are you so upset? And so I'm like, huh, that's an interesting mindset that not that I wasn't encouraging to them, but like, yeah, this can be like, you're doing fine for it, just being your first time, but just trying around, you know, helping those bottom kids, like, hey, it's okay, don't give up. You do have to like, you know, take home your instrument and practice five minutes. I bet this will help you increase. @12:51 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Right. And I mean, that definitely resonates with my experience too. anybody who's every time beginners anywhere knows. being the father of two, three children also is a telling thing that I've dealt with, that sort of instant perfectionism as the only option a lot. @13:10 - Lauren Kaminski yeah, it's like, I'm not good at this. And it's like, you just, we just did it. @13:14 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, it's gonna be an expert right now. This is your first day, it's okay. @13:18 - Lauren Kaminski So just trying to like, you know, and like, you know, with all the curriculum that in my mind, like, we need to get through in sixth grade and like, how that's changed off the years with trying to keep the kids like more invested and like, you know, it's meals. I mean, like, you could spend hours on scales with clarinet, you know, and it's like, the kids don't really, truly care about that anymore, but like, trying to like, have a balance between, you know, hey, I'm teaching you the scales and I'm kind of giving it to you. I did have kids this year that like, went with it, and they like learned stuff on their own, which I haven't had in the last few years, like, they wanted me to see them everything. So, you know, trying to keep the curriculum engaging and you know still getting what I need to get done but also like not pushing scales so much or whatever one part of my curriculum that they're like well I don't this is boring but I can't do this you know the kids that can't cross the break as well I can't you know. @14:17 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Now there's one's upon the time that I would send kids to the office for saying can't like I said it's a cuss word and we're gonna send it and I did that once actually it was the the front office people were in on the gag but we got the point across we we didn't have much of that but at the same time like that's the atrix and that works for a small class of kids that want to be good but how many you know of those classes do we actually have. Ariana or is there anything that you've kind of noticed in your teaching or like barriers to learning or challenges your kids are having and Ariana's gonna walk by the way yeah sorry back country road in Virginia. @14:53 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) We're not that well I mean I'm in a neighborhood. Okay. It was really interesting that she brought up Lauren, that she brought up the perfectionism mixed with the lack of interest and skills, because I will say that I've seen that quite bit over the last couple of years since we came back from COVID. My biggest like hurdle is talking, not me talking, but the students, even though they want to learn everything is still like somehow we've still forgotten to be in a classroom. And we can't get as much done because they just want to talk and then they get mad that they're not as good at something. If you let me finish explaining something so we could do it, then we'd be better at it. So that's really like for somebody who felt like I had pretty good classroom management skills for so long. The last couple of years have really kind of thrown me. And it's not just me like we're seeing it across the school, across the district. from what I've read in a lot of, you know, forums and stuff, it's a relatively common thing since we've come back. But yeah, just trying to get the interest, you know, you sign up for the class, you want to be here. So what is it that you want to do? And some of it's not going to be super fun. I always told my kids, especially at the orchestra, the first year is so boring. Oh my gosh, beginning at orchestra. And, you know, we can hear what band is playing next door and beginning dance is so much more exciting. And they can play full pieces that are like super exciting because everybody writes for the beginning dance. And nobody writes for the beginning orchestra. And I'm like, stick with it. Just trust me that after this year, it's going to be way more fun. And so then we don't, when we do our concerts and they hear seventh and eighth grade, like, oh, but getting them to that point. And even getting my son at the eighth graders to keep pushing through the conversation has just been, it's really thrown. me. And it kind of made me a little scattered and like, kind of keep myself on track when you're talking about curriculum and, you know, balancing the needs of your class was like, I wanted, I want to stay on this topic and get this done, but that's not, you can't always go to that because we've got to focus on the class. That made sense. @17:21 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Oh, totally does. And I mean, I think what both of you have touched on is, I wouldn't take these are new problems, right? These have always been things that kids do and kids struggle with, especially the talking because I'm finding out, um, starts earlier than I thought it did. So the, but like COVID has not been kind to any of this. And even before COVID, kids being raised on screens has not been kind to any of this. One of the things that screens are designed to do is distract like they're meant to engage you, not by getting into like some sort of flow state where like you or one with a machine and whatever is going on, it's much more like you're just constantly distracted being in a casino, basically. A casino of attention is what a lot of people have called it, and that only exacerbates the problems that we're seeing or the challenges we're seeing our kids experience. know, the perfectionism kind of comes from that. Like, if I don't, there's very low cost to quitting things when the next thing is just to swipe away, right? If all you have is like, I hate to sound like my father was like, all I had was a, you know, an old ball to play with. So you figured out things to do with the ball. There is some validity to that, that kids don't experience tension or friction or even just boredom. They are missing some tools, and that could show up really big in the areas where they're learning and trying new things. But then also like the just the attention to task and being on task and understanding how exchange happens in classrooms, especially when there's hormones involved, which, you know, beginners, that's about when that starts to do isn't fun. Didn't we plan that well? The that can be tricky as well. So it's like, to me, I'd plan to talk a lot more about like kind of general ideas about differentiation and stuff like that, but you're raising things that are kind of a little closer to stuff I've been thinking about. So with your permission, mean, we could just explore these as kind of the the test bed for the stuff we're talking about. And like the biggest thing, I think that comes to mind on things we're talking about quote unquote are, you know, when we're looking for the kid to do xyz, what is the thing we're looking for and how well defined is it in our brain? You know, whether that is an actual like definition like a rubric or how well formed is the target. behavior in our brain in terms of I could describe the qualities of it and I could also show you how far away you are from whatever it is that I'm evaluating you against. Like when we think about that in a musical sense we probably have a pretty good repertoire of things to pull from. But are those things we're pulling from always where the kids need them to be, right? In the sense that we have these kind of plans of action for like how to play this note better on an instrument. But if the kids are swirly or kind of everywhere where they crumble, like I always call them like paper children, they just kind of burst into flames when anything goes wrong. You know those kind of mechanisms we use to teach stuff like do these steps or do this thing or you know A to B to C to D might not work. And so it's adapting the outcomes we're looking for to not just the tools we have. The tools are probably pretty good. But how the students work themselves into the tools is kind of, I think, the missing piece that is something that we can spend some time talking about. And so let's go back to your example, Lauren, of kids just kind of crumbling when something goes wrong. normally the kids in that bottom third in terms of their skill acquisition. And there's already things acting on them that make that kind of heightened, maybe too, depending on the kid. And so, like, I guess my question is, like, what are some of the skills you're seeing them kind of hit as a wall? Is it like really, really routine basic stuff? Or is it more advanced skills or the combining stuff? where do you kind of see that wall happen if you see it happen in one place? @21:49 - Lauren Kaminski You know, I feel like it depends on the day. Like, for some kids, sometimes it's like they might just be having a bad day. And so they come in and it's like, okay, like I'm just. It's gonna, you know, let him be, you know, but I would say probably, I feel like, kind of in the beginning, I feel like everyone, you know, kind of gets the first skills that we're doing. It's probably once we start kind of, you know, spring semester when we're doing harder skill sets, but that's when stuff happens or, you know, I had a few kids like break down around the winter music when we were preparing that for the concert. So I would kind of say, you know, I guess higher level skills and like around the winter concert for some kids. @22:38 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So, and like if, if memory serves, because it's been a while since I've done a beginner here, so like that also is for you, does that involve the entire ensemble playing together for the first time? @22:51 - Lauren Kaminski Or do they still do lines out of the book? We do. Each class does a song. Their own song and then we have a unison line that the whole band does. together, and then we do one piece that has like two different parts going on. And I mean, like I have two different clarinet parts. So I'm like teaching clarinet parts for the first time and kind of explaining what first part is and second part is and that kind of thing. @23:16 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay. And I mean, that's, you know, for beginners, that's challenging. part of me has to wonder kind of getting back to the perfectionism, the kind of fragile child, paper children's syndrome. How much or is any of the challenges you're experienced exacerbated by the social dimension that's kind of rushing in, right? You're kind of in your little bubble of the flute class with clarinet class or whatever it is. And then you kind of, you know, lack of a better term, stir up the bowl of skittles and you see everything all mixed together and some kids, that is hugely destabilizing. Even kids that aren't diagnosed as being on the spectrum tend to function that way a little bit more because because they don't have the same social cues. didn't grow up with them the same way, and there's little bubble of them that's kind of floating through the educational system. what you're describing, we're gonna see in about six years, and with some modifications, maybe. So I mean, I wonder, is that playing into it at all, or do you think it's removed enough from that, that it's not a direct link? @24:23 - Lauren Kaminski I don't know, you know, I know like one kid that he like threw a fit one day with our class song, and the next day he came back, we had a test later on that week, and he played it, and he played it, and I looked at him, and I was like, you got an A, that was amazing, what'd you do? I went home and practiced, okay, so you throw on a fit the other day that you couldn't get it, it's just because you hadn't done your stuff at home. So, you know, and I think we do, so like our classes all meet at the same time, so we have three beginner classes going, and so like we'll come find them, especially for the winter stuff, it gets closer, so like, hey, this is kind of what you can see, you know? And so they get to kind of be with their friends and everything. But I don't know, I just think, you know, kids learn at different rates. I know I look like math, I wasn't good at math, and I always laughed because we did some like smart math thing in high school. And it was like, we started at late, so we were doing skills that we had already learned, and then we were doing other stuff. And so I was like finally getting good with smart math on the skills that we had already been tested over. So I know, like, kids do hit stuff. It's just a matter of like, what can I do to like help keep them thinking, keep them in line, and like, just not giving up on themselves learning wise, and the pace of the class going, and not letting the class stall out, while they try to like, figure stuff out. @25:56 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, and since you guys are spread so thin with having three simultaneous. these classes and three directors, right? like, that's not good. You can't be like, Oh, somebody coming to do this thing. You know, I have to wonder, especially because practice at home kind of becomes the thing of like, that, you know, see, that works, but they have to kind of find it on their own. They can't be told anything because heaven, defend that someone knows something they don't. But is there a way to do something worth like, that not working? Okay. And like, have a thing that they do, whether it's like shadow play or whatever, like give them a routine, you should move on to the next person, but give them like a set of behaviors to do that also reinforces what it's like to break down a problem, like the thing we teach them to do when, you know, before they take their instrument homes, like, here's kind of how you think through something that doesn't work, how to make it work better. And so maybe something along those lines might be helpful, because then that also, like, like, to me, practice time is @27:00 - Lauren Kaminski like work if you make it that way and that like it was something I have to do it's like this thing I have to check off rather than like I have this thing that's not working I'm going to go spend some time on it like we want the kids to get to that place but they've got to see the payoff and this cohort is really payoff averse in terms of like if it's not there right away it's the end of the world and I will say sometimes you know kids will help each other so it's like if they can tell I'll move on and they're co-person you know because I mix up the kids I somewhat sat them in share order and then I kind of mix kids around that could help other kids and so I would move on and they would the kid next to me be like hey it's you know you got to do and so they would kind of step in also but sometimes I mean kids would not accept it's like they're just trying to help you like I had a kid get upset one time that a friend was trying to help them but for the most part like kids are very accepting of like each other trying to help them and I'm like fine with that. I'm like, maybe they can say it better than I'm saying it, you know, or they can clarify. so if I see a kid, you know, reaching over and helping or, you know, the kid knows like, hey, this person's better than me, I'll move on and they're like, hey, can you show me X, Y, or Z? @28:17 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Well, I think that plays into also this idea. And we've talked about this before in this course of like bands and really all the ensemble traditions, but band orchestras, choirs are the big ones in the US that are these like organisms that don't exist in other ways, other places. So if you think about the music of, you know, pick any country where it's like, oh, the music of this thing that's not like what we have in the West, most of their ensembles are not 50, 60 people minimum, right? They're, they're, you know, a collection of eight to 12 people, kind of what we would call chamber group size. We have to, as band directors and orchestra directors and bar directors think about the social structure and the social dimension of what we're doing and having kids have the skills to accept that help and to go, okay, this person is not criticizing me. I remember Mr. you know, you always say like first thing is like, I give you feedback. It's information. It's not criticism. It's never about you. It's about what you're doing. He was always really kind of overly pointed about that. But at the same time, kids need that clear boundary too, because a lot of them do not pick up on subtlety anymore. sarcasm is really hard to come back as sarcasm lives on subtlety. And it's just not landing with the children these days, for whatever reason. And so, you know, like, to me, that might be something to explore of maybe on the first day, you know, this is something we do in our vamper and we help each other. And if you're not okay with that, here's what you say and you just have some sort of like, you know, it's like putting the red card up at a child, like, don't give me any more food. But for the rest of the kids, it's almost like, I'm actually listening to podcast about Richard Thaler, who won the Nobel Prize for creating behavioral economics, and they talk about how when you have a default choice that ups you into something, like over 90% of people just leave it, they don't question, I'm sure whatever that's fine, and maybe treating something like, because it sounds like the kind they feel like they have to get it with you, or all those lost, and so they don't have any other tools to lean back off that creates this kind of, for some of them, really panicky, heightened sense of, ooh, I'm not good enough, which heaven knows they already do anyways, we don't need to help that, it's already there. And so maybe even something to be like, you know, we help each other in this band program, and here's what it looks like, here's how you don't want it, here's what you say, if you do want it, you just let the other person start talking, and they know we do. you get to set the rules for what helping looks like. we use the same words we use in class, but we might explain them a little bit differently. It might even just be like that kid needs five reps and you have time for two to that day. You know, like, because I remember observing student teacher in your class, and like you had 20 some odd, like it was a big flute class, which is great that's what you want, but like there's one of you and you kind of are limited, but the size program you have and the way your structure is set up, like you've got to adapt to that, but if the kids aren't getting it, we have to find other ways. So building that sort of autonomy and I'm okay, if you don't get it with me, turn to your person next to you when you guys can workshop it together or whatever that looks like, however you want to have that to be set up. That might be an option because what you're doing there is you're differentiating the task by extending the time the student gets suspended, like it's classic, you know, one of the accommodations you'd put on an IEP that also who doesn't belabor the fact that we are usually one to 60 or one to 25 or one to whatever big ratio in our classroom. so like additional time doesn't always scale to what we need to get done. So that might be something to think about. And I think the other thing too, and this is something we all struggle with as teachers, is defining what the minimum, like what is the thing that we're going to go, okay, that's good for today. It's really hard for some kids to know what that is because in their brain, for whatever reason, if it's not perfect, then it's not good enough. Like they have a binary relationship with things. And so for us as teachers and as musicians to define, okay, here are the things we're going to use to describe what I want you to do. Here's what it sounds like when I demonstrate it, or it sounds like when someone else in the class demonstrates it. But here's other areas that are going to be good enough. Like sometimes kids need that. And it might not take more than two or three times to do something along the lines of that. So they start building this image of like, oh, there's a range of what's acceptable. There's a, it's not a, you know, bull's eye or nothing. Like, and we know, like, if they hold the sound still on that first day, we're really happy. Like, you're doing great, kid. But some of the kids are so scared. And we see this with the undergrads, too. Like, they are terrified to say something wrong, which that's been around forever. Like, I felt that way in music school. know you both did a high cost of being wrong in the school of music. But these kids are almost paralyzed by it. Because even more, even once it's clear that there are no stakes for saying something wrong and sense of like, you're going to be made fun of, they still do not want to put their money out there. They're really reticent to kind of bite at things. And then once they do, they do what you'd expect them to do. get really into it. It's great. but needing them to make that decision is hard. like you said, it's about making things sticky. Oh, there I am, must be home now. It's also about making things sticky in the sense of, we want the, I always tell the undergrads, like you're going remember about 10% of the things we do in this class. It's one of them to make sure that 10% you remember is the stuff that helps you the best. And so finding a way to make the things that really need to be sticky stick. So, you know, like you said, the basic fundamentals of things, kids tend to pick up really well and it's getting them to be comfortable with kind of putting things together, you know, like the two-headed monster on Sesame Street. Like these two skills that they do is together and becomes a new thing. And that also might be another place where letting them kind of have the freedom to spin out a little bit, not literally, figuratively, work with their person, can't beat you in the next round. And then you're going to have a couple kids make up. Like, you can play that however you work for your flow in your classroom. But I think giving them that autonomy, but then also showing them, you know, here's what it sounds like at the beginning, and it's kind of like at the end, and that's not all about just being here, it's about the growth to get there, and all the things we tell them to keep them engaged, because you know, those bottom kids, I don't know about you, but I was one of those bottom kids once, like, I wasn't always in the wind ensemble, especially when I switched instruments, I used to put trumpet, and then I figured, no, I'm not going to get a high enough chair doing that, so I switched to French horn, because that's what you could do in Pennsylvania at that time, because there was no competition for things like that, but you know, like these kids also deserve a visual experience, and so most of time it boils down to the quantity of time we don't have, and the way that we're spread so thin in our classroom, especially with beginners. You know the classroom control thing too is Like we have to we have to find her comfortable about that like we're taught really early on that the best classrooms are silent Right like if you're focused and they're studying and they're doing all the things I mean maybe sometimes that happens, but usually in the classrooms that I've felt like I've learned the most It's only like that sometimes. It's only like that when someone is talking You know like when everyone's listening while everyone's talking and then once that person's done talking There's a thing that happens whether it's we talk about their cells questions, it is Those tend to be the classrooms the interactive classrooms tend to be the ones that are More conducive to learning, but that's harder to do with big groups with middle schoolers Especially with beginner instrumentalists. It's like hurting cats that are on catnip so You know the the question there is you know, we're not even getting far enough into the higher or even needs to start talking about like transformational stuff. We're talking about like keeping the lights on and keeping shelter over our head, that these kids can't get passed, like just how to be in society. And so, you know, like where's the failing? I don't think there's anyone thinking we can point to, but what can we do to augment it? And so, you know, for that, if you tried going way back to basics and having them stand in hallway, Ariana, like right shoulder to the wall and quiet and all the things. @37:30 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) Oh yeah, like we've spent over half a class period at a time doing that. We've repeated it, you know, every other day since I don't see them every day, got over an emailed home reminder of things like it's all, I didn't sign up for the, I didn't look at it yet, but this got laying the backpack that he sent out this year, which is supposed to be like a last room agreement. type thing that you set up with your classes and so I was just curious and I was like let me sign up for it and see what it looks like in all of my free time which I clearly have since I'm doing my two mile walks at nine o'clock at night you know I have not looked at it yet so I'm curious just because maybe that's the thing that gets these kids this year I don't know as far as instructionally aside from talking if I can shift just slightly my biggest instructional issue outside of the talking has been transferring of skills like okay like I have had to because I had to pick up violin so quickly because I had no idea what I was doing I've even noticed this oftentimes I'll read in intervals instead of actually paying attention to the notes that are happening because I don't have time to think about what's happening as I'm trying to keep up with my eighth graders who are obviously playing more than I am at at their level because they get to spend more time teaching them music than playing it with them. But the transference of like, okay, you're going to play open one, two, and then guess what we're going to do on the next string? Open one, two, three, and everything goes up one letter in the alphabet. one or open one, three, four, unless it's base, in which case bases have to shift just to play one scale. It's a lot for them. But like, my students have not been able to, sorry, my husband just needs to bless you. I've not been able to transfer the idea of literally it's the exact same finger pattern on all four strings. All four, one letter at a time. Like, for some reason, especially this past year, like it never clicked, never. And I thought of every possible way that I could come up with to explain it. And I feel like I failed miserably. mean, we got through music by then, you know, when it was all said and done. But now I'm like, okay, how do we avoid that coming year? And it's to the point that I've actually thought about going slightly Suzuki and having them play notes before they see them on a staff. Not too far. Like I don't want them learning full pieces of music and then throwing, you know, at them. But like, okay, let's learn how to play Open D. Okay, here's what you just played and this is what it looks like. Because I thought maybe with this group, it was just too much information at once. I don't know. I can't, it can't hurt anything to try it that way. If I quickly see that it's not working, then we just shift gears and go back to, you know, Plan A. But that transference of knowledge, which I always felt like I was very good about stacking suddenly felt like I didn't know what I was doing at all because it just wasn't, it didn't click this year. And I think probably talking was a part of that where there was was never enough focused to just, oh, I'm doing the same thing over and over again. It just, there was never enough attention. I mean, I don't know, I grew up in a program that is like, I don't know about now, but at the time, hadn't gotten anything less than a superior and over 20 something years. didn't talk. Failure was not an option. It was, so that was what I was so used to. And I don't regret that. actually quite enjoyed it. It made me very competitive. I think it turned me into the better. I mean, I saw the kids when that, because they laugh, because I'll sing along to like essential elements, lines as band plays next door. And they're like, how do you know this? I'm like, well, know, back in the 1900s, when their music was on a cassette tape, I would rewind the track and I would practice for an hour. they're like, what is rewind me? What's like a sat tape? you practice for an hour. or I don't take my instrument home. like, there's that huge disconnect because obviously the teachers are the ones who we are those nerds who took our instruments home and worked all the time. And so trying to be like, okay, you didn't practice at home. Let's give you some time here. But also we do need to push forward and figuring out what didn't work last year and how to make it work this year. @42:27 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, I think the thing that stands out to me the most, there is, you know, transfer of learning is something that kind of is a course to water for a situation, right? Like you can't make, you can make them to a certain point, but then they have to be like, oh yeah, thing. Like I know the way I learned how to teach going over the break and not make it something scary was flip their instrument around. So I'm holding it in their mouth and I control everything. so they do the same error, do the exact same thing. And, you know, we do... Really basic limited stuff, but to show them like going to the break, you don't change anything. It's just your fingers and That kind of narrow the the attention of like things that are scary about this this Right, but that was just an demonstration in front of the kids like for whatever reason that stuck And I think you're doing the right thing around and like going I'm gonna try this one thing this year I'm gonna try this one try the contract within this year But I guess then then my question is like what is living kind of before that in in this chain of dominoes Like what is the thing that's typically the domino that makes you have to go get a behavioral contract? What are they coming in with something? Are they is it truly just to change in the students? Sorry everything just went to nighttime mode, so it's literally a little bit You know like Is there a change in the school culture if they're just a change in the way kids are like and this is where we all kind of Guard ourselves against sounding like our parents, but at the same time super generations of different personalities. So, where do you think your specific issue kind of lives maybe? @44:07 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) I mean, we are about to have our fourth superintendent in my 10 years here. We are on our third principle, not counting acting principles in the interim in my 10 years here. This past year so there was a big shift. doesn't explain sixth graders coming in necessarily because it didn't matter if he was new or not. Everybody, anybody would have been new to him. But a school culture shift and how we address, we have extremely high teacher turnover. This year I think we only lost, I'm probably going to get a from the other room in a minute, but I think only like 10 to 15. We usually it's closer to 30, and they're almost always brand new teachers, so the school culture alone is harder to address in one classroom when everybody's new and everybody's hair is on fire all the time, you know. Even if I might have my rules, they may or may not be the same as another teacher who has done this forever, who has never done this before, or isn't licensed to teach and has never been in school since they got out of school, you know, so it's a very I don't want to say it's a difficult school, it's not that, it's just that it's a difficult environment sometimes because it's changing constantly, there's a lack of consistency, so I think that's felt across the student body, whether they realize it or not, like obviously like I said the sixth graders won't feel that, it's just somewhere new for them. do feel like mature 30 levels are different. We're seeing this weird thing with technology, and I've told my kids before, like, it used to be like, when I got the internet, you know, way back when it was dialups, that if you wouldn't say something to somebody's face, you wouldn't say it online because it was mean, and now the kids are growing up saying mean things online first, and so they have no problem saying those things to people's faces because all the US trash talk each other online with their access to games and things like that, and so we're seeing some of that, and I was going somewhere else with that and I don't remember where. What was it? I don't know, but just the maturity. So we have this weird thing where they're exposed to things that they probably shouldn't be exposed to at younger ages, so in some ways like they're not necessarily more mature, but they've been around more mature things. But like Laura was saying, I have more kids that whose hands need to be held figuratively. They really are so scared of doing it wrong, or they've never had to problem-solve themselves. They need somebody to tell them every single step of the way, my kids just turn six, but when they're like three and four, I'm like, figure it out. don't solve the world's problems, but there's an issue in front of you that you're capable of solving what's solved it, and I always tell them, know, I'm giving you the tools you need to be successful. It's up to you to use them. And then kind of like you were saying with Mr. Green, like I always tell kids, like, it's not personal. I promise you, you'll know if it's personal, but I'm addressing something. It's just because it's something that needs to be fixed. It doesn't mean you're horrible. It doesn't mean you're a bad player or a bad person. Just means you did something wrong. got to address and we move on, and it's no big deal. And some kids take that very internal. and I'm like, I, as somebody who internalizes everything, I wouldn't do that to you. Like, because I understand what that would feel like. But yeah, just kind of feeling that, I think that is also part of that level of immaturity that we're seeing is that they don't know how to handle when we address them. They don't get that it's for the greater good, not because they're bad at something. It doesn't mean they're bad. It's just that your finger is low too. It's like, you know, mean going around with the trombones and it Pam, Pam Beasley from the office and it's like, second position, third position, what's the difference? They're the same thing, know, for my kids, it's low too. I, at our spring concert, I'm like, well, too, well, too to one of my violins this year, because she, you're playing regular too, but I'm like, it's like, try not to be loud enough for the audience to hear it. Right. Right, exactly. So just those There's little things without them taking it personally, but also just getting through it and applying it. @49:09 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, and I mean that's something where we maybe have to kind of help them and be much more maybe structured than we might otherwise want to be because like you pointed out Lauren, like some of these kids need to be handheld all the way through and maybe some of them don't come from homes where they have to think on their own, you know, like we've all come across the helicopter parent or the lawnmower parent or the bulldozer parent or whatever piece of construction equipment that we're talking about the parents operating to defend their child from all adversity. So we know what that's like, but you know, we also know we have to find a way ideally to integrate those kids into a group that is probably cut from different kids than them. And so a lot of times it's, you know, what's the pathway to this thing I need to do and there's actually some really interesting book you might have come across, some of them might not have come across others. There's three that have really stood out to me in recent kind of coinage, because there's a lot of these out here that are interesting but not actually helpful, and these kind of hit both targets of being interesting and helpful. The first one is this guy named Josh Weitzken, who if you've seen the movie Finding Bobby Fisher, like it's about this kid, like he was Trust Grandmaster at H14, like one of those mostly talented kids, and he wrote a book all about the way he learned, and you kind of have to grit your teeth, because he's very, it reads like maybe some other Silicon Valley people might read, that sort of, I am the god among men from Etheostown from the Mountain sort of thing, so you have to get past that, but he does a lot where he talks about this is one of the things I think that was really well for us as musicians of space repetition, like we're going to do this thing at this interval between and we do stuff in between, but then also this idea of incremental learning and breaking it down into the smallest piece. And like one of the things that I've pulled from that and I've tried to apply is how do we give the kids the tools to break down the thing that's challenging them into something they can't accomplish, and then something else they can accomplish, then they chain those things together into the third thing. And however many steps it takes, because we don't have the time to do that for them. wish we could in the best of all possible worlds we can, but that's not where we live. And so, you know, books like that, it's called The Art of Learning, and I'll send a summary over to you in the morning. It is, again, you have to kind of get around the tone that he writes with, but he does point some things out. And a lot of it is stuff that we as teachers can do more to install into our programs. And this is what I mean by that. We have a collection of kids in front of us at any given time, any ensemble, any class that can do things independent of us, and it's pretty rare that we take advantage of that in a meaningful way. When they play, they're doing stuff on their own, but that's kind of in coordination with us. We kind of are holding their hands in some ways there. But do we have any place for them to not be off the rails, but to have some autonomy, to have some areas to explore in so that we can teach them steps, like how to break this down into this thing, how to break this down into this thing without me being there. So what's the thing that's challenging you? I can't do that thing. Okay, what are the things we need to do to do that? for you, especially for you, Ariana, this actually might help you in becoming more familiar with kind of the extended parts of the instruments that you would, you know, if you're going to talk them through like a checklist almost. There's another great book. don't have a sorry this ready, but I can get it ready. Call the checklist manifestos by a doctor named Atul Gawande. Okay. Um, he's a, I think he was an ER doctor. could be wrong about that. What he found though was all of these surgical mistakes were coming about because everybody thought somebody else had done it. So they created basically a checklist to do these things where this person is going to walk out with gods in their body. So the stakes are a lot higher, but the idea of a kid being able to create like, okay, what are the things I'm doing to make this thing happen? Whatever it is, going, you know, doing a shift, whether it's playing an octave slur on flute, whether it's, you know, the chromatic scale that makes everyone cry on clarinet. You know, whatever it is, how, how can they focus down to the thing that is going to, once they fix it, be the news of difference. And I think empowering kids to have that is something that doesn't happen overnight. But if we have it as a goal, we start to develop kids that are helpful. one to themselves, but also other people, it can be more that when we help each other, this is what we fill it with. We were talking about that earlier, Lauren. But the other thing is that they are going to be assets to the group as well because they are not going to, unless it's really severe, add problems to the list of things. They're going to try and fix their own problems first. part of that is motivation. like you said, it's hard to get these kids excited about stuff because there's all this other noise happening in their lives. And the thing that kept on coming to mind there, and this doesn't apply equally in both situations at all, but this kind of idea that things outside of the room are in, outside of the orchestra, outside of band hall are chaos at any given time. They're just nuts. some time with hallways, you'll hear it. Come into our room, very ordered, where we have our things, we but then how much of that can we spin? and got a lot of energy into like, is it Miss Penny, whatever her name is in Matilda, the movie, the rolled doll movie, Miss Honey? Yeah, her. Yes. That like, not Miss Frizzle, what we can do Miss Frizzle little too easily. But Miss Honey, where it's like you are the the reason part of the reason why the kids come to your room is because it is that place where they feel safe and all these things. And I think we kind of get the safe space and all like the kind of leftist language kind of frets that down and makes it sound unappealing. But at the end of the day, how much can we project that to the kids? By the way, we teach them how to handle problems, right? The biggest problem with chaos is you don't know how to enter it to make anything make sense. But we'll teach you a way here to take the thing that's not making sense and at least find one step you can take to making it better and then take another step and another step. And that's hard. Like, I don't have an answer for what that looks like specifically. to each of us. But I think if we turn our attention to it, it'll ordeal itself. Because it's going to be built on the things you already know how to do well and feel comfortable getting kids to do. It's just a matter of getting them to use those same tools, and then check back in with you. Because that's the other thing you do is you introduce variability into what they decide to do with the thing. And so that's a question of training. Like when we start them off, when we have the conversation, same conversation maybe as we help each other in here is, here are the things we think are the most important. Our sound stays still, our sound is good, or whatever, however that lives. We work together, we never worked against each other, whatever that is. Because a lot of this I think is coming down to not the content we have, but how the kids connect and get into the content. Like what's their entry point? And I think you both identified that the entry point is, if not completely different, at least different enough that it doesn't. and map to what we've done before. And you're both a good enough teacher if you're finding your feet, in terms of making something work to make the thing happen using the old content and maybe a new way of approaching it. But I guess my question is, how can we take the content without changing it, without watering it down? you talked about Lauren, like nobody wants to do scales anymore. True, I I'm not sure they ever want to do scales. think we did them because we had to. But, and not even like, how can we make it fun and gamify? think that's gonna, you're gonna see a lot of technology solutions that are gonna do things like that for the reason you're pointing out. It's, you know, kids are just wondering. But how can we take the actual ideas themselves? Whether they're note names, whether they're, you know, pitch organizations, whether they're more higher-end things like style and articulation and make them stickier. So we don't have to basically re-teach them. over and over again. They stick and we can build on them. And one of the things is another book that you're going get a summary of is called Make It Stick. Can we either of you come across that before? It's actually really interesting book in the education space that talks about literally how people learn and one of the things it brings up to, similar to the first one we talk about, it's a space repetition of like we do it here and then we're going to wait little while and we do it here and we do it really intensely in those two spots, but we don't touch it in between which like for us as teachers scares us and it's probably not something you're going to apply to everything, but in both of these books explore what's kind of the boundary of things that are affected by this and where just the complexity of the task is too much, it doesn't work. So the other thing there too though is this idea of effortful learning like that you have to put some skin in the game, you have to try this thing and you know the other thing that I worked on kind of later in my career was this idea of you know if you don't think it's going to work but I'm asking you to do do it. I want you to at least try it. Just like when you're a little kid, you got some, you know, whatever the thing is, you don't want to eat. You just have to try a little bit of it. And if you do, fine. Because nine times out of ten, the thing that I wanted them to do, they didn't want to do, works. So it's more to get them over that. But then finding those levers with kids, I think, is a really important thing that they have to put some effort into it, but that the effort is returned by the positive reward. Now, part of that is where we set the reward. Is the reward playing the time of your scale? Or in the case of kids learning, you know, open one, one, three, four, whatever it is, that you can go, okay, next one's going to start on the G string. And like, hopefully it's not G string. But the, like, they have to jump and do the thing. And that's the reward there. It's not that they're learning it's transferable. that, oh, did that thing, and I did it fast and I did it faster than the next person, whatever it is. And so all of a sudden, then you can start to refine things, okay? Hey, now, it's not just who's fastest, who sounds the best, like you can start playing that game. And so it's a matter of, again, meeting them where they are, but not with the content. It's the pathway you create to the content. And heaven knows TikTok is not going to do us any favors in letting kids have longer attention spans moving forward. Like that's just not what happened, I don't think. And so it's up to us to find ways around that. And one of the ways we know is to return dopamine really, really quickly to get a kid hooked. It's the same thing as the candy does, same things that cigarettes do. It gets that dopamine loop happening. all of a sudden the kid is in it to win it. So it's finding those. And actually a third book and then a lead to be to consider picking up. this, if you don't buy any of the books, this I think is the best one to buy for what we do. It's called intelligent music teaching by a guy named Bob Duke. He is music at University of Texas. And well, music and human wondering is what they call it. They're because they want to be very specific. It's true. That's what they study and do a very good job of it. It has a lot of things in there that I think help clarify teaching. In fact, if I would never do it because it's his book, but I would love to teach a course just of this book for a summer thing, where it's kind of a pick up session, because it's these little essays. They're, I think, the longest is maybe 20 pages. it's all these different aspects of learning and how we learn the music and the things we assume are happening that maybe actually aren't happening in ways that we can think differently to be closer to what the kids are actually doing, but also kind of spin their effort back on itself to kind of build them into a little dynamo much faster. you want to think of it that way, it's a great book. It's pretty inexpensive. I think it's like maybe 18 bucks on Amazon and it's thin. It's very slender. It's just a little wisp of a book. But in terms of thinking about how students learn, I think that's a really great book to check out. I'll send you the outline where we talked through today, but all. So the summary and the transcript and book recommendations in the video tomorrow in the morning. Thank you guys for being here. It was good to see both of you. I'm glad you didn't get hit by a car this time, Ariana. ACTION ITEM: Send Lauren and Ariana summary and transcript of call, links to recommended books (The Art of Learning, Checklist Manifesto, Intelligent Music Teaching), and video recording - WATCH Not that you did last time, but there was concern and Lauren was good seeing you. @1:02:18 - Lauren Kaminski Yes, same. I was going to say about the candy and stuff. We started doing tetric boards before Christmas. And so I told the kids, I was like, all right, to earn a sticker, it's this tempo. If you want candy to try to like encourage more dexterity and fingers quicker, like it's this tempo. I mean, kids wanted that candy. mean, once the very first time we did like, no one really wanted to volunteer. So I kind of pushed on the kids that I knew would be successful and made them fall and told them. But it kind of like, you know, once the kids kind of saw like some success from other kids, like, I mean, they would come in, are we going to do tetra cords today? Are we going to get to, you know, It was just so funny that it's like candy tempo or a sticker tempo. Oh, tempo. @1:03:04 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You know, it's just amazing. @1:03:06 - Lauren Kaminski Candy does. @1:03:07 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Mm hmm. I mean, and that's the thing though, like, we're finding that even though these kids present very weirdly, they are the same kids we talked before. There's just a different pathway to get to what you've discovered. like the place where they get they do the thing that all kids do and they light up like a light bulb. Yeah. @1:03:23 - Lauren Kaminski ice cream sandwiches when we got when we got into scales, it was like, okay, with multiple octaves. So it was like, all right, if you get your region eight, and for the planets, I made it a six to make them feel a little more successful because their skills are harder. But I'm like, you get a star and an ice cream sandwich, and then you get your other scale sheet. And so then you can earn something else. And so that was my mildly successful, like I had planets that like, you know, wanted that ice cream sandwich. And so they got their six and then they finished, I helped them finish off their others. But it's just kind of, I'm like, always like, okay, what can like kind of put them in want to. And I, you know, I did videos for flutes and the other woodwind stuff I teach, I don't really do the videos, but with clarinets, there's so much specific like things, greens. I did videos and I posted them into our Schoology. And so some kids like, Hey, you can go rewatch this. Like we did it in class today. But guess what? talked about it and explain it in this video. So some kids would go and rewatch the video and some that would struggle in class. It's like, well, did you watch my video? Well, no, I guess I can. like, well, it's going to go step by step for you at home. It's like having me at your house trying to get them even just like use the Schoology videos. Like I made these videos. You know, I wish I don't think they got used as much. I know some students use them, but more kids would like buy into like, Hey, it's okay if I, you know, go home and figure this out or go home and she went over this in class. @1:04:56 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I didn't get it. And now it's in a literally a video. @1:05:00 - Lauren Kaminski I'm always like, how can I you know help and kind of like you said buy them in like get them get them in Yeah, and I mean that's amazing that you've done even not even what you've done. @1:05:12 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You've done like that is a lot of It's captured a couple kids along the way. I'm guessing It's like I think the other thing maybe that that we as teachers kind of need to wrap our branch around It's it's not pleasant is that these kids are like whereas before they were like maybe three or four things Everybody's into now. They're like thousands like they're into a little bit of everything It's what some theres called the long tail of the internet where like you can do with a thousand other people that like that very specific thing because the internet connects you from all over the world and so You know that we don't have those same pressures and things to pull on so I think anything you can do to Kind of help them is good But it might need to be a bunch of different things to capture a bunch of different kids You have in their classroom and so like this idea that we all have as teachers of the silver bullet that solves all the problems was never a reality before, but sometimes it worked. I think it's less than less effective now, and I think you touched on it really well, Lauren, with like having to do a bunch of different things to capture kind of enough kid that you see the progress you want to have. And I think that's, and if we're thinking about student learning, the first thing that is vital and central there is thinking about student learning. Like what are they doing, and how are they doing, and how can we, and you both do this, connect what they are doing with the steps they need to do, the thing we want them to accomplish. And sometimes it's a really easy transfer, sometimes it is a much further transfer, and so we need to kind of build back. But you know, the fact that one of the things that came up is this idea of community, this thing of culture, or this thing of, you know, help each other, like that starts to get into kind of the social emotional stuff too, which I know is, you know, anathema in some conversations, but at the same time, it's always been part of how we teach music and arts. so I think that's something to consider, too, that both of you from where you're talking sound like is installed in your thinking, always using everything as an opportunity to build on both at the same time. So where you're building community, it also helps the skill achievement or that sort of thing. Big brothers, big sisters, big buddies, whatever term you want to use for that might be a way to kind of want to extend your reach, or given that you're one person of how many, but two, allow you to kind of give those eighth graders that are chopping at the bit, something that is, there's consistently, it's not a special thing, so they can act like a twerp. They'll get out of the act feeling a twerp phase and get into actually being humans about it if you give them enough time. And so I think the stuff you both said you do is exactly what you need to do, but I don't need to do that because this stuff you do works. But at the end of the day, I think these three books are kind of good things to have in the back of your brain. But the thinking about it's not the content necessarily, the content is good, content works. know, the content has stood the test of time in a lot of ways to achieve the ends it wants to achieve. But are we then our job then becomes how do we connect the kids experience what they naturally gravitate towards and how they navigate the world with the stuff we want them to do. And those connection points kind of got fried during COVID in a lot of ways in ways that we're learning every year. So I don't envy you that. We're dealing with, you know, a lesser version of it just with way better hiding skills in the college. But at least you can identify what it is. And that gives you a much better chance of hitting the target now that you've figured out what it isn't. It's not the content. It's not your teaching. It's connecting the kids with the stuff you bring. And that's not easy. And hopefully these books, these outlines of this stuff will be a place for you to build a couple of ideas that work this year. @1:09:06 - Lauren Kaminski Yeah. Thanks. @1:09:08 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) It was very interesting. @1:09:10 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) The time went by fast. Cool. I'm happy to be a lovely waste of time. I will see. @1:09:17 - Lauren Kaminski I'm like, my brain's already kind of like turning. So it's kind of, you know, just a different way of thinking about next year. @1:09:24 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Good. Yeah. mean, that's really what this is supposed to be. @1:09:27 - Lauren Kaminski a way for us like it's yoga for your brain. @1:09:29 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah. don't have to think about me doing yoga. @1:09:33 - Lauren Kaminski would not be successful.

                "content": "﻿Ensemble Director Refresh - July 30, 2024 Summary & Transcript Overview In the Ensemble Director Refresh session on July 30, 2024, educators discussed strategies to support beginner music students who often face frustration, perfectionism, and difficulty transferring skills. Key approaches include creating a supportive classroom environment where mistakes are normalized, using incremental learning steps, and providing focused practice opportunities. Allowing students autonomy in problem-solving and using varied incentives to increase motivation were also highlighted. Connecting musical content to students' lived experiences makes learning more accessible and engaging. Recommended resources for further insights included \"The Art of Learning,\" \"Make It Stick,\" and \"Intelligent Music Teaching.\" VIEW RECORDING - 70 mins (No highlights) Key Takeaways * Beginner music students often struggle with frustration, perfectionism, lack of focus, and difficulty transferring skills when learning new concepts and techniques. This can lead to shutting down or giving up easily. * Building a supportive classroom community where mistakes are normalized and students feel safe taking risks is crucial for their learning process. Peer support systems can be valuable. * Breaking down complex skills into incremental steps, providing focused practice opportunities, and celebrating small successes help students progress without getting overwhelmed. * Giving students some autonomy to problem-solve challenges independently or in pairs before intervening as the teacher can build their confidence and skills. * Using varied incentives and rewards that motivate students increases their engagement with effortful practice and learning. * Connecting the musical content meaningfully to students' lived experiences, interests, and existing skills makes it more accessible and \"sticky\" for retention. Topics Discussed Challenges Faced by Beginner Music Students The participants shared the common challenges their beginner students face in learning music: * Frustration and shutting down when unable to immediately grasp a new skill * Perfectionist mindsets - if they can't do it perfectly, they get discouraged * Lack of focused attention and excessive talking in class * Difficulty transferring skills across contexts (e.g. across strings on instruments) * Immaturity in independent problem-solving, expecting constant hand-holding * Struggles with combining or building on previously learned skills These challenges are likely exacerbated by factors like high teacher/school turnover disrupting consistent culture, student exposure to more mature content through technology, and changing student mindsets in the post-COVID world. Effective Strategies to Support Student Learning The educators discussed several promising strategies to facilitate beginner student learning: * Fostering a supportive classroom community where mistakes are normalized * Explicitly teaching routines for peer support and collaborative problem-solving * Breaking down complex tasks into incremental steps for scaffolded learning * Using varied incentives like food, rewards, and games to increase motivation * Allowing students autonomy to try solving challenges before intervening * Making musical concepts \"stickier\" through repetitive practice over time * Connecting abstract concepts to concrete skills/experiences students already have * Meeting students \"where they are\" by understanding their specific entry points * Framing the classroom as a safe space amidst external chaos Recommended Resources Cory recommended three books that provide research-based insights into how students learn: 1. \"The Art of Learning\" by Josh Waitzkin - Discusses strategies like spaced repetition and incremental learning 2. \"Make It Stick\" - Explores principles like effortful learning for retention 3. \"Intelligent Music Teaching\" by Robert Duke - Applies cognitive research to music learning specifically The key is understanding it's not necessarily the musical content that needs changing but developing effective pathways to make it engaging and accessible for today's students. Transcript @7:08 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay so speaking of doing things today we're gonna talk about this idea of student learning and kind of all the different ways it lives but talk about it from a perspective that recognizes what we bring as teachers and what our experience brings but also who kind of points our attention to other ways to consider learning or other ways to think about unpacking learning for the kids that already learning it for the first time or are experiencing challenges in their growth and that sort of thing. So you know the first thing and we all know this is that all growth especially learning is non-linear. like it's not an A to B to see the sort of situation with any kid, you know, if we think back to all the teaching we've done, how many kids actually do the build on the old skill in a really clean fashion across time? Like I am very few. And those kids tend to be just kids that are naturally gifted, but they're not very many of them. We're teaching more, should be teaching more to like the two thirds that are easily captureable, easily like if we tell them these things, these things will turn into the kids doing stuff really well. That's part of the what I call the magic words philosophy or like, oh, don't say soft, say, you know, whatever, like there are people for whom like the specific language are used is really important. And in some cases, in very much is. But and this is the crux of the issue here a lot of what we kind of think and bring into it can cloud our vision actually what's happening with the students. And what they are and aren't picking up on that we're laying down. And so, you know, this idea that we have to create this perfect learning environment actually might not be the thing that serves them the absolute best. You know, I've taught with people, I've done it myself where we kind of, we sit there and go, you know, my kids can't make mistakes. Mistakes aren't an option. And one of the things that we'll talk about today, but also just kind of in general, is that actually mistakes are one of more valuable things in the learning process as long as they are scappled in the same way, like we talk to our kids about making better mistakes. Don't make the same mistake over again. Make a better mistake next time. And that is actually, research is starting to show kind of what we all are experienced is, is that we learn best by experience and we learn best by that sort of granular understanding that comes from doing the thing. And then. anything else from that maybe doesn't really work so well so we're gonna cover little bit of how we adapt those skills and adapt the things that we ask our kids to do based on our deeper understanding of what it is we're actually asking them to do so I guess the first question I have for either of you is what you know when you're thinking about learning like one of the things we think about are the challenges to learn and so like what are some of the challenges you see in your classroom that are either present enough they come to mind first or were memorable enough that they come to mind first I would say kids just getting frustrated like beginner specifically you know it's like they can't get the task that day and so they get frustrated and then they shut down so like how can I do something else in order to make them like not shut down @12:00 - Lauren Kaminski And, you know, keep pushing the other kids because, you know, sometimes at that point in the year, you have your kids that are up here, you have your middle, and then you have your bottom. And so sometimes it seems more often than not, it's the bottom that is getting frustrated. And so how do you keep the bottom? Like, hey, it's okay that you, and I will say like having Mario, like he kind of taught me, like he would tell the kids like, hey, it's your first time doing this. Why are you so upset? And so I'm like, huh, that's an interesting mindset that not that I wasn't encouraging to them, but like, yeah, this can be like, you're doing fine for it, just being your first time, but just trying around, you know, helping those bottom kids, like, hey, it's okay, don't give up. You do have to like, you know, take home your instrument and practice five minutes. I bet this will help you increase. @12:51 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Right. And I mean, that definitely resonates with my experience too. anybody who's every time beginners anywhere knows. being the father of two, three children also is a telling thing that I've dealt with, that sort of instant perfectionism as the only option a lot. @13:10 - Lauren Kaminski yeah, it's like, I'm not good at this. And it's like, you just, we just did it. @13:14 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, it's gonna be an expert right now. This is your first day, it's okay. @13:18 - Lauren Kaminski So just trying to like, you know, and like, you know, with all the curriculum that in my mind, like, we need to get through in sixth grade and like, how that's changed off the years with trying to keep the kids like more invested and like, you know, it's meals. I mean, like, you could spend hours on scales with clarinet, you know, and it's like, the kids don't really, truly care about that anymore, but like, trying to like, have a balance between, you know, hey, I'm teaching you the scales and I'm kind of giving it to you. I did have kids this year that like, went with it, and they like learned stuff on their own, which I haven't had in the last few years, like, they wanted me to see them everything. So, you know, trying to keep the curriculum engaging and you know still getting what I need to get done but also like not pushing scales so much or whatever one part of my curriculum that they're like well I don't this is boring but I can't do this you know the kids that can't cross the break as well I can't you know. @14:17 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Now there's one's upon the time that I would send kids to the office for saying can't like I said it's a cuss word and we're gonna send it and I did that once actually it was the the front office people were in on the gag but we got the point across we we didn't have much of that but at the same time like that's the atrix and that works for a small class of kids that want to be good but how many you know of those classes do we actually have. Ariana or is there anything that you've kind of noticed in your teaching or like barriers to learning or challenges your kids are having and Ariana's gonna walk by the way yeah sorry back country road in Virginia. @14:53 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) We're not that well I mean I'm in a neighborhood. Okay. It was really interesting that she brought up Lauren, that she brought up the perfectionism mixed with the lack of interest and skills, because I will say that I've seen that quite bit over the last couple of years since we came back from COVID. My biggest like hurdle is talking, not me talking, but the students, even though they want to learn everything is still like somehow we've still forgotten to be in a classroom. And we can't get as much done because they just want to talk and then they get mad that they're not as good at something. If you let me finish explaining something so we could do it, then we'd be better at it. So that's really like for somebody who felt like I had pretty good classroom management skills for so long. The last couple of years have really kind of thrown me. And it's not just me like we're seeing it across the school, across the district. from what I've read in a lot of, you know, forums and stuff, it's a relatively common thing since we've come back. But yeah, just trying to get the interest, you know, you sign up for the class, you want to be here. So what is it that you want to do? And some of it's not going to be super fun. I always told my kids, especially at the orchestra, the first year is so boring. Oh my gosh, beginning at orchestra. And, you know, we can hear what band is playing next door and beginning dance is so much more exciting. And they can play full pieces that are like super exciting because everybody writes for the beginning dance. And nobody writes for the beginning orchestra. And I'm like, stick with it. Just trust me that after this year, it's going to be way more fun. And so then we don't, when we do our concerts and they hear seventh and eighth grade, like, oh, but getting them to that point. And even getting my son at the eighth graders to keep pushing through the conversation has just been, it's really thrown. me. And it kind of made me a little scattered and like, kind of keep myself on track when you're talking about curriculum and, you know, balancing the needs of your class was like, I wanted, I want to stay on this topic and get this done, but that's not, you can't always go to that because we've got to focus on the class. That made sense. @17:21 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Oh, totally does. And I mean, I think what both of you have touched on is, I wouldn't take these are new problems, right? These have always been things that kids do and kids struggle with, especially the talking because I'm finding out, um, starts earlier than I thought it did. So the, but like COVID has not been kind to any of this. And even before COVID, kids being raised on screens has not been kind to any of this. One of the things that screens are designed to do is distract like they're meant to engage you, not by getting into like some sort of flow state where like you or one with a machine and whatever is going on, it's much more like you're just constantly distracted being in a casino, basically. A casino of attention is what a lot of people have called it, and that only exacerbates the problems that we're seeing or the challenges we're seeing our kids experience. know, the perfectionism kind of comes from that. Like, if I don't, there's very low cost to quitting things when the next thing is just to swipe away, right? If all you have is like, I hate to sound like my father was like, all I had was a, you know, an old ball to play with. So you figured out things to do with the ball. There is some validity to that, that kids don't experience tension or friction or even just boredom. They are missing some tools, and that could show up really big in the areas where they're learning and trying new things. But then also like the just the attention to task and being on task and understanding how exchange happens in classrooms, especially when there's hormones involved, which, you know, beginners, that's about when that starts to do isn't fun. Didn't we plan that well? The that can be tricky as well. So it's like, to me, I'd plan to talk a lot more about like kind of general ideas about differentiation and stuff like that, but you're raising things that are kind of a little closer to stuff I've been thinking about. So with your permission, mean, we could just explore these as kind of the the test bed for the stuff we're talking about. And like the biggest thing, I think that comes to mind on things we're talking about quote unquote are, you know, when we're looking for the kid to do xyz, what is the thing we're looking for and how well defined is it in our brain? You know, whether that is an actual like definition like a rubric or how well formed is the target. behavior in our brain in terms of I could describe the qualities of it and I could also show you how far away you are from whatever it is that I'm evaluating you against. Like when we think about that in a musical sense we probably have a pretty good repertoire of things to pull from. But are those things we're pulling from always where the kids need them to be, right? In the sense that we have these kind of plans of action for like how to play this note better on an instrument. But if the kids are swirly or kind of everywhere where they crumble, like I always call them like paper children, they just kind of burst into flames when anything goes wrong. You know those kind of mechanisms we use to teach stuff like do these steps or do this thing or you know A to B to C to D might not work. And so it's adapting the outcomes we're looking for to not just the tools we have. The tools are probably pretty good. But how the students work themselves into the tools is kind of, I think, the missing piece that is something that we can spend some time talking about. And so let's go back to your example, Lauren, of kids just kind of crumbling when something goes wrong. normally the kids in that bottom third in terms of their skill acquisition. And there's already things acting on them that make that kind of heightened, maybe too, depending on the kid. And so, like, I guess my question is, like, what are some of the skills you're seeing them kind of hit as a wall? Is it like really, really routine basic stuff? Or is it more advanced skills or the combining stuff? where do you kind of see that wall happen if you see it happen in one place? @21:49 - Lauren Kaminski You know, I feel like it depends on the day. Like, for some kids, sometimes it's like they might just be having a bad day. And so they come in and it's like, okay, like I'm just. It's gonna, you know, let him be, you know, but I would say probably, I feel like, kind of in the beginning, I feel like everyone, you know, kind of gets the first skills that we're doing. It's probably once we start kind of, you know, spring semester when we're doing harder skill sets, but that's when stuff happens or, you know, I had a few kids like break down around the winter music when we were preparing that for the concert. So I would kind of say, you know, I guess higher level skills and like around the winter concert for some kids. @22:38 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So, and like if, if memory serves, because it's been a while since I've done a beginner here, so like that also is for you, does that involve the entire ensemble playing together for the first time? @22:51 - Lauren Kaminski Or do they still do lines out of the book? We do. Each class does a song. Their own song and then we have a unison line that the whole band does. together, and then we do one piece that has like two different parts going on. And I mean, like I have two different clarinet parts. So I'm like teaching clarinet parts for the first time and kind of explaining what first part is and second part is and that kind of thing. @23:16 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay. And I mean, that's, you know, for beginners, that's challenging. part of me has to wonder kind of getting back to the perfectionism, the kind of fragile child, paper children's syndrome. How much or is any of the challenges you're experienced exacerbated by the social dimension that's kind of rushing in, right? You're kind of in your little bubble of the flute class with clarinet class or whatever it is. And then you kind of, you know, lack of a better term, stir up the bowl of skittles and you see everything all mixed together and some kids, that is hugely destabilizing. Even kids that aren't diagnosed as being on the spectrum tend to function that way a little bit more because because they don't have the same social cues. didn't grow up with them the same way, and there's little bubble of them that's kind of floating through the educational system. what you're describing, we're gonna see in about six years, and with some modifications, maybe. So I mean, I wonder, is that playing into it at all, or do you think it's removed enough from that, that it's not a direct link? @24:23 - Lauren Kaminski I don't know, you know, I know like one kid that he like threw a fit one day with our class song, and the next day he came back, we had a test later on that week, and he played it, and he played it, and I looked at him, and I was like, you got an A, that was amazing, what'd you do? I went home and practiced, okay, so you throw on a fit the other day that you couldn't get it, it's just because you hadn't done your stuff at home. So, you know, and I think we do, so like our classes all meet at the same time, so we have three beginner classes going, and so like we'll come find them, especially for the winter stuff, it gets closer, so like, hey, this is kind of what you can see, you know? And so they get to kind of be with their friends and everything. But I don't know, I just think, you know, kids learn at different rates. I know I look like math, I wasn't good at math, and I always laughed because we did some like smart math thing in high school. And it was like, we started at late, so we were doing skills that we had already learned, and then we were doing other stuff. And so I was like finally getting good with smart math on the skills that we had already been tested over. So I know, like, kids do hit stuff. It's just a matter of like, what can I do to like help keep them thinking, keep them in line, and like, just not giving up on themselves learning wise, and the pace of the class going, and not letting the class stall out, while they try to like, figure stuff out. @25:56 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, and since you guys are spread so thin with having three simultaneous. these classes and three directors, right? like, that's not good. You can't be like, Oh, somebody coming to do this thing. You know, I have to wonder, especially because practice at home kind of becomes the thing of like, that, you know, see, that works, but they have to kind of find it on their own. They can't be told anything because heaven, defend that someone knows something they don't. But is there a way to do something worth like, that not working? Okay. And like, have a thing that they do, whether it's like shadow play or whatever, like give them a routine, you should move on to the next person, but give them like a set of behaviors to do that also reinforces what it's like to break down a problem, like the thing we teach them to do when, you know, before they take their instrument homes, like, here's kind of how you think through something that doesn't work, how to make it work better. And so maybe something along those lines might be helpful, because then that also, like, like, to me, practice time is @27:00 - Lauren Kaminski like work if you make it that way and that like it was something I have to do it's like this thing I have to check off rather than like I have this thing that's not working I'm going to go spend some time on it like we want the kids to get to that place but they've got to see the payoff and this cohort is really payoff averse in terms of like if it's not there right away it's the end of the world and I will say sometimes you know kids will help each other so it's like if they can tell I'll move on and they're co-person you know because I mix up the kids I somewhat sat them in share order and then I kind of mix kids around that could help other kids and so I would move on and they would the kid next to me be like hey it's you know you got to do and so they would kind of step in also but sometimes I mean kids would not accept it's like they're just trying to help you like I had a kid get upset one time that a friend was trying to help them but for the most part like kids are very accepting of like each other trying to help them and I'm like fine with that. I'm like, maybe they can say it better than I'm saying it, you know, or they can clarify. so if I see a kid, you know, reaching over and helping or, you know, the kid knows like, hey, this person's better than me, I'll move on and they're like, hey, can you show me X, Y, or Z? @28:17 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Well, I think that plays into also this idea. And we've talked about this before in this course of like bands and really all the ensemble traditions, but band orchestras, choirs are the big ones in the US that are these like organisms that don't exist in other ways, other places. So if you think about the music of, you know, pick any country where it's like, oh, the music of this thing that's not like what we have in the West, most of their ensembles are not 50, 60 people minimum, right? They're, they're, you know, a collection of eight to 12 people, kind of what we would call chamber group size. We have to, as band directors and orchestra directors and bar directors think about the social structure and the social dimension of what we're doing and having kids have the skills to accept that help and to go, okay, this person is not criticizing me. I remember Mr. you know, you always say like first thing is like, I give you feedback. It's information. It's not criticism. It's never about you. It's about what you're doing. He was always really kind of overly pointed about that. But at the same time, kids need that clear boundary too, because a lot of them do not pick up on subtlety anymore. sarcasm is really hard to come back as sarcasm lives on subtlety. And it's just not landing with the children these days, for whatever reason. And so, you know, like, to me, that might be something to explore of maybe on the first day, you know, this is something we do in our vamper and we help each other. And if you're not okay with that, here's what you say and you just have some sort of like, you know, it's like putting the red card up at a child, like, don't give me any more food. But for the rest of the kids, it's almost like, I'm actually listening to podcast about Richard Thaler, who won the Nobel Prize for creating behavioral economics, and they talk about how when you have a default choice that ups you into something, like over 90% of people just leave it, they don't question, I'm sure whatever that's fine, and maybe treating something like, because it sounds like the kind they feel like they have to get it with you, or all those lost, and so they don't have any other tools to lean back off that creates this kind of, for some of them, really panicky, heightened sense of, ooh, I'm not good enough, which heaven knows they already do anyways, we don't need to help that, it's already there. And so maybe even something to be like, you know, we help each other in this band program, and here's what it looks like, here's how you don't want it, here's what you say, if you do want it, you just let the other person start talking, and they know we do. you get to set the rules for what helping looks like. we use the same words we use in class, but we might explain them a little bit differently. It might even just be like that kid needs five reps and you have time for two to that day. You know, like, because I remember observing student teacher in your class, and like you had 20 some odd, like it was a big flute class, which is great that's what you want, but like there's one of you and you kind of are limited, but the size program you have and the way your structure is set up, like you've got to adapt to that, but if the kids aren't getting it, we have to find other ways. So building that sort of autonomy and I'm okay, if you don't get it with me, turn to your person next to you when you guys can workshop it together or whatever that looks like, however you want to have that to be set up. That might be an option because what you're doing there is you're differentiating the task by extending the time the student gets suspended, like it's classic, you know, one of the accommodations you'd put on an IEP that also who doesn't belabor the fact that we are usually one to 60 or one to 25 or one to whatever big ratio in our classroom. so like additional time doesn't always scale to what we need to get done. So that might be something to think about. And I think the other thing too, and this is something we all struggle with as teachers, is defining what the minimum, like what is the thing that we're going to go, okay, that's good for today. It's really hard for some kids to know what that is because in their brain, for whatever reason, if it's not perfect, then it's not good enough. Like they have a binary relationship with things. And so for us as teachers and as musicians to define, okay, here are the things we're going to use to describe what I want you to do. Here's what it sounds like when I demonstrate it, or it sounds like when someone else in the class demonstrates it. But here's other areas that are going to be good enough. Like sometimes kids need that. And it might not take more than two or three times to do something along the lines of that. So they start building this image of like, oh, there's a range of what's acceptable. There's a, it's not a, you know, bull's eye or nothing. Like, and we know, like, if they hold the sound still on that first day, we're really happy. Like, you're doing great, kid. But some of the kids are so scared. And we see this with the undergrads, too. Like, they are terrified to say something wrong, which that's been around forever. Like, I felt that way in music school. know you both did a high cost of being wrong in the school of music. But these kids are almost paralyzed by it. Because even more, even once it's clear that there are no stakes for saying something wrong and sense of like, you're going to be made fun of, they still do not want to put their money out there. They're really reticent to kind of bite at things. And then once they do, they do what you'd expect them to do. get really into it. It's great. but needing them to make that decision is hard. like you said, it's about making things sticky. Oh, there I am, must be home now. It's also about making things sticky in the sense of, we want the, I always tell the undergrads, like you're going remember about 10% of the things we do in this class. It's one of them to make sure that 10% you remember is the stuff that helps you the best. And so finding a way to make the things that really need to be sticky stick. So, you know, like you said, the basic fundamentals of things, kids tend to pick up really well and it's getting them to be comfortable with kind of putting things together, you know, like the two-headed monster on Sesame Street. Like these two skills that they do is together and becomes a new thing. And that also might be another place where letting them kind of have the freedom to spin out a little bit, not literally, figuratively, work with their person, can't beat you in the next round. And then you're going to have a couple kids make up. Like, you can play that however you work for your flow in your classroom. But I think giving them that autonomy, but then also showing them, you know, here's what it sounds like at the beginning, and it's kind of like at the end, and that's not all about just being here, it's about the growth to get there, and all the things we tell them to keep them engaged, because you know, those bottom kids, I don't know about you, but I was one of those bottom kids once, like, I wasn't always in the wind ensemble, especially when I switched instruments, I used to put trumpet, and then I figured, no, I'm not going to get a high enough chair doing that, so I switched to French horn, because that's what you could do in Pennsylvania at that time, because there was no competition for things like that, but you know, like these kids also deserve a visual experience, and so most of time it boils down to the quantity of time we don't have, and the way that we're spread so thin in our classroom, especially with beginners. You know the classroom control thing too is Like we have to we have to find her comfortable about that like we're taught really early on that the best classrooms are silent Right like if you're focused and they're studying and they're doing all the things I mean maybe sometimes that happens, but usually in the classrooms that I've felt like I've learned the most It's only like that sometimes. It's only like that when someone is talking You know like when everyone's listening while everyone's talking and then once that person's done talking There's a thing that happens whether it's we talk about their cells questions, it is Those tend to be the classrooms the interactive classrooms tend to be the ones that are More conducive to learning, but that's harder to do with big groups with middle schoolers Especially with beginner instrumentalists. It's like hurting cats that are on catnip so You know the the question there is you know, we're not even getting far enough into the higher or even needs to start talking about like transformational stuff. We're talking about like keeping the lights on and keeping shelter over our head, that these kids can't get passed, like just how to be in society. And so, you know, like where's the failing? I don't think there's anyone thinking we can point to, but what can we do to augment it? And so, you know, for that, if you tried going way back to basics and having them stand in hallway, Ariana, like right shoulder to the wall and quiet and all the things. @37:30 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) Oh yeah, like we've spent over half a class period at a time doing that. We've repeated it, you know, every other day since I don't see them every day, got over an emailed home reminder of things like it's all, I didn't sign up for the, I didn't look at it yet, but this got laying the backpack that he sent out this year, which is supposed to be like a last room agreement. type thing that you set up with your classes and so I was just curious and I was like let me sign up for it and see what it looks like in all of my free time which I clearly have since I'm doing my two mile walks at nine o'clock at night you know I have not looked at it yet so I'm curious just because maybe that's the thing that gets these kids this year I don't know as far as instructionally aside from talking if I can shift just slightly my biggest instructional issue outside of the talking has been transferring of skills like okay like I have had to because I had to pick up violin so quickly because I had no idea what I was doing I've even noticed this oftentimes I'll read in intervals instead of actually paying attention to the notes that are happening because I don't have time to think about what's happening as I'm trying to keep up with my eighth graders who are obviously playing more than I am at at their level because they get to spend more time teaching them music than playing it with them. But the transference of like, okay, you're going to play open one, two, and then guess what we're going to do on the next string? Open one, two, three, and everything goes up one letter in the alphabet. one or open one, three, four, unless it's base, in which case bases have to shift just to play one scale. It's a lot for them. But like, my students have not been able to, sorry, my husband just needs to bless you. I've not been able to transfer the idea of literally it's the exact same finger pattern on all four strings. All four, one letter at a time. Like, for some reason, especially this past year, like it never clicked, never. And I thought of every possible way that I could come up with to explain it. And I feel like I failed miserably. mean, we got through music by then, you know, when it was all said and done. But now I'm like, okay, how do we avoid that coming year? And it's to the point that I've actually thought about going slightly Suzuki and having them play notes before they see them on a staff. Not too far. Like I don't want them learning full pieces of music and then throwing, you know, at them. But like, okay, let's learn how to play Open D. Okay, here's what you just played and this is what it looks like. Because I thought maybe with this group, it was just too much information at once. I don't know. I can't, it can't hurt anything to try it that way. If I quickly see that it's not working, then we just shift gears and go back to, you know, Plan A. But that transference of knowledge, which I always felt like I was very good about stacking suddenly felt like I didn't know what I was doing at all because it just wasn't, it didn't click this year. And I think probably talking was a part of that where there was was never enough focused to just, oh, I'm doing the same thing over and over again. It just, there was never enough attention. I mean, I don't know, I grew up in a program that is like, I don't know about now, but at the time, hadn't gotten anything less than a superior and over 20 something years. didn't talk. Failure was not an option. It was, so that was what I was so used to. And I don't regret that. actually quite enjoyed it. It made me very competitive. I think it turned me into the better. I mean, I saw the kids when that, because they laugh, because I'll sing along to like essential elements, lines as band plays next door. And they're like, how do you know this? I'm like, well, know, back in the 1900s, when their music was on a cassette tape, I would rewind the track and I would practice for an hour. they're like, what is rewind me? What's like a sat tape? you practice for an hour. or I don't take my instrument home. like, there's that huge disconnect because obviously the teachers are the ones who we are those nerds who took our instruments home and worked all the time. And so trying to be like, okay, you didn't practice at home. Let's give you some time here. But also we do need to push forward and figuring out what didn't work last year and how to make it work this year. @42:27 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, I think the thing that stands out to me the most, there is, you know, transfer of learning is something that kind of is a course to water for a situation, right? Like you can't make, you can make them to a certain point, but then they have to be like, oh yeah, thing. Like I know the way I learned how to teach going over the break and not make it something scary was flip their instrument around. So I'm holding it in their mouth and I control everything. so they do the same error, do the exact same thing. And, you know, we do... Really basic limited stuff, but to show them like going to the break, you don't change anything. It's just your fingers and That kind of narrow the the attention of like things that are scary about this this Right, but that was just an demonstration in front of the kids like for whatever reason that stuck And I think you're doing the right thing around and like going I'm gonna try this one thing this year I'm gonna try this one try the contract within this year But I guess then then my question is like what is living kind of before that in in this chain of dominoes Like what is the thing that's typically the domino that makes you have to go get a behavioral contract? What are they coming in with something? Are they is it truly just to change in the students? Sorry everything just went to nighttime mode, so it's literally a little bit You know like Is there a change in the school culture if they're just a change in the way kids are like and this is where we all kind of Guard ourselves against sounding like our parents, but at the same time super generations of different personalities. So, where do you think your specific issue kind of lives maybe? @44:07 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) I mean, we are about to have our fourth superintendent in my 10 years here. We are on our third principle, not counting acting principles in the interim in my 10 years here. This past year so there was a big shift. doesn't explain sixth graders coming in necessarily because it didn't matter if he was new or not. Everybody, anybody would have been new to him. But a school culture shift and how we address, we have extremely high teacher turnover. This year I think we only lost, I'm probably going to get a from the other room in a minute, but I think only like 10 to 15. We usually it's closer to 30, and they're almost always brand new teachers, so the school culture alone is harder to address in one classroom when everybody's new and everybody's hair is on fire all the time, you know. Even if I might have my rules, they may or may not be the same as another teacher who has done this forever, who has never done this before, or isn't licensed to teach and has never been in school since they got out of school, you know, so it's a very I don't want to say it's a difficult school, it's not that, it's just that it's a difficult environment sometimes because it's changing constantly, there's a lack of consistency, so I think that's felt across the student body, whether they realize it or not, like obviously like I said the sixth graders won't feel that, it's just somewhere new for them. do feel like mature 30 levels are different. We're seeing this weird thing with technology, and I've told my kids before, like, it used to be like, when I got the internet, you know, way back when it was dialups, that if you wouldn't say something to somebody's face, you wouldn't say it online because it was mean, and now the kids are growing up saying mean things online first, and so they have no problem saying those things to people's faces because all the US trash talk each other online with their access to games and things like that, and so we're seeing some of that, and I was going somewhere else with that and I don't remember where. What was it? I don't know, but just the maturity. So we have this weird thing where they're exposed to things that they probably shouldn't be exposed to at younger ages, so in some ways like they're not necessarily more mature, but they've been around more mature things. But like Laura was saying, I have more kids that whose hands need to be held figuratively. They really are so scared of doing it wrong, or they've never had to problem-solve themselves. They need somebody to tell them every single step of the way, my kids just turn six, but when they're like three and four, I'm like, figure it out. don't solve the world's problems, but there's an issue in front of you that you're capable of solving what's solved it, and I always tell them, know, I'm giving you the tools you need to be successful. It's up to you to use them. And then kind of like you were saying with Mr. Green, like I always tell kids, like, it's not personal. I promise you, you'll know if it's personal, but I'm addressing something. It's just because it's something that needs to be fixed. It doesn't mean you're horrible. It doesn't mean you're a bad player or a bad person. Just means you did something wrong. got to address and we move on, and it's no big deal. And some kids take that very internal. and I'm like, I, as somebody who internalizes everything, I wouldn't do that to you. Like, because I understand what that would feel like. But yeah, just kind of feeling that, I think that is also part of that level of immaturity that we're seeing is that they don't know how to handle when we address them. They don't get that it's for the greater good, not because they're bad at something. It doesn't mean they're bad. It's just that your finger is low too. It's like, you know, mean going around with the trombones and it Pam, Pam Beasley from the office and it's like, second position, third position, what's the difference? They're the same thing, know, for my kids, it's low too. I, at our spring concert, I'm like, well, too, well, too to one of my violins this year, because she, you're playing regular too, but I'm like, it's like, try not to be loud enough for the audience to hear it. Right. Right, exactly. So just those There's little things without them taking it personally, but also just getting through it and applying it. @49:09 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, and I mean that's something where we maybe have to kind of help them and be much more maybe structured than we might otherwise want to be because like you pointed out Lauren, like some of these kids need to be handheld all the way through and maybe some of them don't come from homes where they have to think on their own, you know, like we've all come across the helicopter parent or the lawnmower parent or the bulldozer parent or whatever piece of construction equipment that we're talking about the parents operating to defend their child from all adversity. So we know what that's like, but you know, we also know we have to find a way ideally to integrate those kids into a group that is probably cut from different kids than them. And so a lot of times it's, you know, what's the pathway to this thing I need to do and there's actually some really interesting book you might have come across, some of them might not have come across others. There's three that have really stood out to me in recent kind of coinage, because there's a lot of these out here that are interesting but not actually helpful, and these kind of hit both targets of being interesting and helpful. The first one is this guy named Josh Weitzken, who if you've seen the movie Finding Bobby Fisher, like it's about this kid, like he was Trust Grandmaster at H14, like one of those mostly talented kids, and he wrote a book all about the way he learned, and you kind of have to grit your teeth, because he's very, it reads like maybe some other Silicon Valley people might read, that sort of, I am the god among men from Etheostown from the Mountain sort of thing, so you have to get past that, but he does a lot where he talks about this is one of the things I think that was really well for us as musicians of space repetition, like we're going to do this thing at this interval between and we do stuff in between, but then also this idea of incremental learning and breaking it down into the smallest piece. And like one of the things that I've pulled from that and I've tried to apply is how do we give the kids the tools to break down the thing that's challenging them into something they can't accomplish, and then something else they can accomplish, then they chain those things together into the third thing. And however many steps it takes, because we don't have the time to do that for them. wish we could in the best of all possible worlds we can, but that's not where we live. And so, you know, books like that, it's called The Art of Learning, and I'll send a summary over to you in the morning. It is, again, you have to kind of get around the tone that he writes with, but he does point some things out. And a lot of it is stuff that we as teachers can do more to install into our programs. And this is what I mean by that. We have a collection of kids in front of us at any given time, any ensemble, any class that can do things independent of us, and it's pretty rare that we take advantage of that in a meaningful way. When they play, they're doing stuff on their own, but that's kind of in coordination with us. We kind of are holding their hands in some ways there. But do we have any place for them to not be off the rails, but to have some autonomy, to have some areas to explore in so that we can teach them steps, like how to break this down into this thing, how to break this down into this thing without me being there. So what's the thing that's challenging you? I can't do that thing. Okay, what are the things we need to do to do that? for you, especially for you, Ariana, this actually might help you in becoming more familiar with kind of the extended parts of the instruments that you would, you know, if you're going to talk them through like a checklist almost. There's another great book. don't have a sorry this ready, but I can get it ready. Call the checklist manifestos by a doctor named Atul Gawande. Okay. Um, he's a, I think he was an ER doctor. could be wrong about that. What he found though was all of these surgical mistakes were coming about because everybody thought somebody else had done it. So they created basically a checklist to do these things where this person is going to walk out with gods in their body. So the stakes are a lot higher, but the idea of a kid being able to create like, okay, what are the things I'm doing to make this thing happen? Whatever it is, going, you know, doing a shift, whether it's playing an octave slur on flute, whether it's, you know, the chromatic scale that makes everyone cry on clarinet. You know, whatever it is, how, how can they focus down to the thing that is going to, once they fix it, be the news of difference. And I think empowering kids to have that is something that doesn't happen overnight. But if we have it as a goal, we start to develop kids that are helpful. one to themselves, but also other people, it can be more that when we help each other, this is what we fill it with. We were talking about that earlier, Lauren. But the other thing is that they are going to be assets to the group as well because they are not going to, unless it's really severe, add problems to the list of things. They're going to try and fix their own problems first. part of that is motivation. like you said, it's hard to get these kids excited about stuff because there's all this other noise happening in their lives. And the thing that kept on coming to mind there, and this doesn't apply equally in both situations at all, but this kind of idea that things outside of the room are in, outside of the orchestra, outside of band hall are chaos at any given time. They're just nuts. some time with hallways, you'll hear it. Come into our room, very ordered, where we have our things, we but then how much of that can we spin? and got a lot of energy into like, is it Miss Penny, whatever her name is in Matilda, the movie, the rolled doll movie, Miss Honey? Yeah, her. Yes. That like, not Miss Frizzle, what we can do Miss Frizzle little too easily. But Miss Honey, where it's like you are the the reason part of the reason why the kids come to your room is because it is that place where they feel safe and all these things. And I think we kind of get the safe space and all like the kind of leftist language kind of frets that down and makes it sound unappealing. But at the end of the day, how much can we project that to the kids? By the way, we teach them how to handle problems, right? The biggest problem with chaos is you don't know how to enter it to make anything make sense. But we'll teach you a way here to take the thing that's not making sense and at least find one step you can take to making it better and then take another step and another step. And that's hard. Like, I don't have an answer for what that looks like specifically. to each of us. But I think if we turn our attention to it, it'll ordeal itself. Because it's going to be built on the things you already know how to do well and feel comfortable getting kids to do. It's just a matter of getting them to use those same tools, and then check back in with you. Because that's the other thing you do is you introduce variability into what they decide to do with the thing. And so that's a question of training. Like when we start them off, when we have the conversation, same conversation maybe as we help each other in here is, here are the things we think are the most important. Our sound stays still, our sound is good, or whatever, however that lives. We work together, we never worked against each other, whatever that is. Because a lot of this I think is coming down to not the content we have, but how the kids connect and get into the content. Like what's their entry point? And I think you both identified that the entry point is, if not completely different, at least different enough that it doesn't. and map to what we've done before. And you're both a good enough teacher if you're finding your feet, in terms of making something work to make the thing happen using the old content and maybe a new way of approaching it. But I guess my question is, how can we take the content without changing it, without watering it down? you talked about Lauren, like nobody wants to do scales anymore. True, I I'm not sure they ever want to do scales. think we did them because we had to. But, and not even like, how can we make it fun and gamify? think that's gonna, you're gonna see a lot of technology solutions that are gonna do things like that for the reason you're pointing out. It's, you know, kids are just wondering. But how can we take the actual ideas themselves? Whether they're note names, whether they're, you know, pitch organizations, whether they're more higher-end things like style and articulation and make them stickier. So we don't have to basically re-teach them. over and over again. They stick and we can build on them. And one of the things is another book that you're going get a summary of is called Make It Stick. Can we either of you come across that before? It's actually really interesting book in the education space that talks about literally how people learn and one of the things it brings up to, similar to the first one we talk about, it's a space repetition of like we do it here and then we're going to wait little while and we do it here and we do it really intensely in those two spots, but we don't touch it in between which like for us as teachers scares us and it's probably not something you're going to apply to everything, but in both of these books explore what's kind of the boundary of things that are affected by this and where just the complexity of the task is too much, it doesn't work. So the other thing there too though is this idea of effortful learning like that you have to put some skin in the game, you have to try this thing and you know the other thing that I worked on kind of later in my career was this idea of you know if you don't think it's going to work but I'm asking you to do do it. I want you to at least try it. Just like when you're a little kid, you got some, you know, whatever the thing is, you don't want to eat. You just have to try a little bit of it. And if you do, fine. Because nine times out of ten, the thing that I wanted them to do, they didn't want to do, works. So it's more to get them over that. But then finding those levers with kids, I think, is a really important thing that they have to put some effort into it, but that the effort is returned by the positive reward. Now, part of that is where we set the reward. Is the reward playing the time of your scale? Or in the case of kids learning, you know, open one, one, three, four, whatever it is, that you can go, okay, next one's going to start on the G string. And like, hopefully it's not G string. But the, like, they have to jump and do the thing. And that's the reward there. It's not that they're learning it's transferable. that, oh, did that thing, and I did it fast and I did it faster than the next person, whatever it is. And so all of a sudden, then you can start to refine things, okay? Hey, now, it's not just who's fastest, who sounds the best, like you can start playing that game. And so it's a matter of, again, meeting them where they are, but not with the content. It's the pathway you create to the content. And heaven knows TikTok is not going to do us any favors in letting kids have longer attention spans moving forward. Like that's just not what happened, I don't think. And so it's up to us to find ways around that. And one of the ways we know is to return dopamine really, really quickly to get a kid hooked. It's the same thing as the candy does, same things that cigarettes do. It gets that dopamine loop happening. all of a sudden the kid is in it to win it. So it's finding those. And actually a third book and then a lead to be to consider picking up. this, if you don't buy any of the books, this I think is the best one to buy for what we do. It's called intelligent music teaching by a guy named Bob Duke. He is music at University of Texas. And well, music and human wondering is what they call it. They're because they want to be very specific. It's true. That's what they study and do a very good job of it. It has a lot of things in there that I think help clarify teaching. In fact, if I would never do it because it's his book, but I would love to teach a course just of this book for a summer thing, where it's kind of a pick up session, because it's these little essays. They're, I think, the longest is maybe 20 pages. it's all these different aspects of learning and how we learn the music and the things we assume are happening that maybe actually aren't happening in ways that we can think differently to be closer to what the kids are actually doing, but also kind of spin their effort back on itself to kind of build them into a little dynamo much faster. you want to think of it that way, it's a great book. It's pretty inexpensive. I think it's like maybe 18 bucks on Amazon and it's thin. It's very slender. It's just a little wisp of a book. But in terms of thinking about how students learn, I think that's a really great book to check out. I'll send you the outline where we talked through today, but all. So the summary and the transcript and book recommendations in the video tomorrow in the morning. Thank you guys for being here. It was good to see both of you. I'm glad you didn't get hit by a car this time, Ariana. ACTION ITEM: Send Lauren and Ariana summary and transcript of call, links to recommended books (The Art of Learning, Checklist Manifesto, Intelligent Music Teaching), and video recording - WATCH Not that you did last time, but there was concern and Lauren was good seeing you. @1:02:18 - Lauren Kaminski Yes, same. I was going to say about the candy and stuff. We started doing tetric boards before Christmas. And so I told the kids, I was like, all right, to earn a sticker, it's this tempo. If you want candy to try to like encourage more dexterity and fingers quicker, like it's this tempo. I mean, kids wanted that candy. mean, once the very first time we did like, no one really wanted to volunteer. So I kind of pushed on the kids that I knew would be successful and made them fall and told them. But it kind of like, you know, once the kids kind of saw like some success from other kids, like, I mean, they would come in, are we going to do tetra cords today? Are we going to get to, you know, It was just so funny that it's like candy tempo or a sticker tempo. Oh, tempo. @1:03:04 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You know, it's just amazing. @1:03:06 - Lauren Kaminski Candy does. @1:03:07 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Mm hmm. I mean, and that's the thing though, like, we're finding that even though these kids present very weirdly, they are the same kids we talked before. There's just a different pathway to get to what you've discovered. like the place where they get they do the thing that all kids do and they light up like a light bulb. Yeah. @1:03:23 - Lauren Kaminski ice cream sandwiches when we got when we got into scales, it was like, okay, with multiple octaves. So it was like, all right, if you get your region eight, and for the planets, I made it a six to make them feel a little more successful because their skills are harder. But I'm like, you get a star and an ice cream sandwich, and then you get your other scale sheet. And so then you can earn something else. And so that was my mildly successful, like I had planets that like, you know, wanted that ice cream sandwich. And so they got their six and then they finished, I helped them finish off their others. But it's just kind of, I'm like, always like, okay, what can like kind of put them in want to. And I, you know, I did videos for flutes and the other woodwind stuff I teach, I don't really do the videos, but with clarinets, there's so much specific like things, greens. I did videos and I posted them into our Schoology. And so some kids like, Hey, you can go rewatch this. Like we did it in class today. But guess what? talked about it and explain it in this video. So some kids would go and rewatch the video and some that would struggle in class. It's like, well, did you watch my video? Well, no, I guess I can. like, well, it's going to go step by step for you at home. It's like having me at your house trying to get them even just like use the Schoology videos. Like I made these videos. You know, I wish I don't think they got used as much. I know some students use them, but more kids would like buy into like, Hey, it's okay if I, you know, go home and figure this out or go home and she went over this in class. @1:04:56 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I didn't get it. And now it's in a literally a video. @1:05:00 - Lauren Kaminski I'm always like, how can I you know help and kind of like you said buy them in like get them get them in Yeah, and I mean that's amazing that you've done even not even what you've done. @1:05:12 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You've done like that is a lot of It's captured a couple kids along the way. I'm guessing It's like I think the other thing maybe that that we as teachers kind of need to wrap our branch around It's it's not pleasant is that these kids are like whereas before they were like maybe three or four things Everybody's into now. They're like thousands like they're into a little bit of everything It's what some theres called the long tail of the internet where like you can do with a thousand other people that like that very specific thing because the internet connects you from all over the world and so You know that we don't have those same pressures and things to pull on so I think anything you can do to Kind of help them is good But it might need to be a bunch of different things to capture a bunch of different kids You have in their classroom and so like this idea that we all have as teachers of the silver bullet that solves all the problems was never a reality before, but sometimes it worked. I think it's less than less effective now, and I think you touched on it really well, Lauren, with like having to do a bunch of different things to capture kind of enough kid that you see the progress you want to have. And I think that's, and if we're thinking about student learning, the first thing that is vital and central there is thinking about student learning. Like what are they doing, and how are they doing, and how can we, and you both do this, connect what they are doing with the steps they need to do, the thing we want them to accomplish. And sometimes it's a really easy transfer, sometimes it is a much further transfer, and so we need to kind of build back. But you know, the fact that one of the things that came up is this idea of community, this thing of culture, or this thing of, you know, help each other, like that starts to get into kind of the social emotional stuff too, which I know is, you know, anathema in some conversations, but at the same time, it's always been part of how we teach music and arts. so I think that's something to consider, too, that both of you from where you're talking sound like is installed in your thinking, always using everything as an opportunity to build on both at the same time. So where you're building community, it also helps the skill achievement or that sort of thing. Big brothers, big sisters, big buddies, whatever term you want to use for that might be a way to kind of want to extend your reach, or given that you're one person of how many, but two, allow you to kind of give those eighth graders that are chopping at the bit, something that is, there's consistently, it's not a special thing, so they can act like a twerp. They'll get out of the act feeling a twerp phase and get into actually being humans about it if you give them enough time. And so I think the stuff you both said you do is exactly what you need to do, but I don't need to do that because this stuff you do works. But at the end of the day, I think these three books are kind of good things to have in the back of your brain. But the thinking about it's not the content necessarily, the content is good, content works. know, the content has stood the test of time in a lot of ways to achieve the ends it wants to achieve. But are we then our job then becomes how do we connect the kids experience what they naturally gravitate towards and how they navigate the world with the stuff we want them to do. And those connection points kind of got fried during COVID in a lot of ways in ways that we're learning every year. So I don't envy you that. We're dealing with, you know, a lesser version of it just with way better hiding skills in the college. But at least you can identify what it is. And that gives you a much better chance of hitting the target now that you've figured out what it isn't. It's not the content. It's not your teaching. It's connecting the kids with the stuff you bring. And that's not easy. And hopefully these books, these outlines of this stuff will be a place for you to build a couple of ideas that work this year. @1:09:06 - Lauren Kaminski Yeah. Thanks. @1:09:08 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) It was very interesting. @1:09:10 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) The time went by fast. Cool. I'm happy to be a lovely waste of time. I will see. @1:09:17 - Lauren Kaminski I'm like, my brain's already kind of like turning. So it's kind of, you know, just a different way of thinking about next year. @1:09:24 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Good. Yeah. mean, that's really what this is supposed to be. @1:09:27 - Lauren Kaminski a way for us like it's yoga for your brain. @1:09:29 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah. don't have to think about me doing yoga. @1:09:33 - Lauren Kaminski would not be successful.

                "content": "﻿Ensemble Director Refresh - July 30, 2024 Summary & Transcript Overview In the Ensemble Director Refresh session on July 30, 2024, educators discussed strategies to support beginner music students who often face frustration, perfectionism, and difficulty transferring skills. Key approaches include creating a supportive classroom environment where mistakes are normalized, using incremental learning steps, and providing focused practice opportunities. Allowing students autonomy in problem-solving and using varied incentives to increase motivation were also highlighted. Connecting musical content to students' lived experiences makes learning more accessible and engaging. Recommended resources for further insights included \"The Art of Learning,\" \"Make It Stick,\" and \"Intelligent Music Teaching.\" VIEW RECORDING - 70 mins (No highlights) Key Takeaways * Beginner music students often struggle with frustration, perfectionism, lack of focus, and difficulty transferring skills when learning new concepts and techniques. This can lead to shutting down or giving up easily. * Building a supportive classroom community where mistakes are normalized and students feel safe taking risks is crucial for their learning process. Peer support systems can be valuable. * Breaking down complex skills into incremental steps, providing focused practice opportunities, and celebrating small successes help students progress without getting overwhelmed. * Giving students some autonomy to problem-solve challenges independently or in pairs before intervening as the teacher can build their confidence and skills. * Using varied incentives and rewards that motivate students increases their engagement with effortful practice and learning. * Connecting the musical content meaningfully to students' lived experiences, interests, and existing skills makes it more accessible and \"sticky\" for retention. Topics Discussed Challenges Faced by Beginner Music Students The participants shared the common challenges their beginner students face in learning music: * Frustration and shutting down when unable to immediately grasp a new skill * Perfectionist mindsets - if they can't do it perfectly, they get discouraged * Lack of focused attention and excessive talking in class * Difficulty transferring skills across contexts (e.g. across strings on instruments) * Immaturity in independent problem-solving, expecting constant hand-holding * Struggles with combining or building on previously learned skills These challenges are likely exacerbated by factors like high teacher/school turnover disrupting consistent culture, student exposure to more mature content through technology, and changing student mindsets in the post-COVID world. Effective Strategies to Support Student Learning The educators discussed several promising strategies to facilitate beginner student learning: * Fostering a supportive classroom community where mistakes are normalized * Explicitly teaching routines for peer support and collaborative problem-solving * Breaking down complex tasks into incremental steps for scaffolded learning * Using varied incentives like food, rewards, and games to increase motivation * Allowing students autonomy to try solving challenges before intervening * Making musical concepts \"stickier\" through repetitive practice over time * Connecting abstract concepts to concrete skills/experiences students already have * Meeting students \"where they are\" by understanding their specific entry points * Framing the classroom as a safe space amidst external chaos Recommended Resources Cory recommended three books that provide research-based insights into how students learn: 1. \"The Art of Learning\" by Josh Waitzkin - Discusses strategies like spaced repetition and incremental learning 2. \"Make It Stick\" - Explores principles like effortful learning for retention 3. \"Intelligent Music Teaching\" by Robert Duke - Applies cognitive research to music learning specifically The key is understanding it's not necessarily the musical content that needs changing but developing effective pathways to make it engaging and accessible for today's students. Transcript @7:08 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay so speaking of doing things today we're gonna talk about this idea of student learning and kind of all the different ways it lives but talk about it from a perspective that recognizes what we bring as teachers and what our experience brings but also who kind of points our attention to other ways to consider learning or other ways to think about unpacking learning for the kids that already learning it for the first time or are experiencing challenges in their growth and that sort of thing. So you know the first thing and we all know this is that all growth especially learning is non-linear. like it's not an A to B to see the sort of situation with any kid, you know, if we think back to all the teaching we've done, how many kids actually do the build on the old skill in a really clean fashion across time? Like I am very few. And those kids tend to be just kids that are naturally gifted, but they're not very many of them. We're teaching more, should be teaching more to like the two thirds that are easily captureable, easily like if we tell them these things, these things will turn into the kids doing stuff really well. That's part of the what I call the magic words philosophy or like, oh, don't say soft, say, you know, whatever, like there are people for whom like the specific language are used is really important. And in some cases, in very much is. But and this is the crux of the issue here a lot of what we kind of think and bring into it can cloud our vision actually what's happening with the students. And what they are and aren't picking up on that we're laying down. And so, you know, this idea that we have to create this perfect learning environment actually might not be the thing that serves them the absolute best. You know, I've taught with people, I've done it myself where we kind of, we sit there and go, you know, my kids can't make mistakes. Mistakes aren't an option. And one of the things that we'll talk about today, but also just kind of in general, is that actually mistakes are one of more valuable things in the learning process as long as they are scappled in the same way, like we talk to our kids about making better mistakes. Don't make the same mistake over again. Make a better mistake next time. And that is actually, research is starting to show kind of what we all are experienced is, is that we learn best by experience and we learn best by that sort of granular understanding that comes from doing the thing. And then. anything else from that maybe doesn't really work so well so we're gonna cover little bit of how we adapt those skills and adapt the things that we ask our kids to do based on our deeper understanding of what it is we're actually asking them to do so I guess the first question I have for either of you is what you know when you're thinking about learning like one of the things we think about are the challenges to learn and so like what are some of the challenges you see in your classroom that are either present enough they come to mind first or were memorable enough that they come to mind first I would say kids just getting frustrated like beginner specifically you know it's like they can't get the task that day and so they get frustrated and then they shut down so like how can I do something else in order to make them like not shut down @12:00 - Lauren Kaminski And, you know, keep pushing the other kids because, you know, sometimes at that point in the year, you have your kids that are up here, you have your middle, and then you have your bottom. And so sometimes it seems more often than not, it's the bottom that is getting frustrated. And so how do you keep the bottom? Like, hey, it's okay that you, and I will say like having Mario, like he kind of taught me, like he would tell the kids like, hey, it's your first time doing this. Why are you so upset? And so I'm like, huh, that's an interesting mindset that not that I wasn't encouraging to them, but like, yeah, this can be like, you're doing fine for it, just being your first time, but just trying around, you know, helping those bottom kids, like, hey, it's okay, don't give up. You do have to like, you know, take home your instrument and practice five minutes. I bet this will help you increase. @12:51 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Right. And I mean, that definitely resonates with my experience too. anybody who's every time beginners anywhere knows. being the father of two, three children also is a telling thing that I've dealt with, that sort of instant perfectionism as the only option a lot. @13:10 - Lauren Kaminski yeah, it's like, I'm not good at this. And it's like, you just, we just did it. @13:14 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, it's gonna be an expert right now. This is your first day, it's okay. @13:18 - Lauren Kaminski So just trying to like, you know, and like, you know, with all the curriculum that in my mind, like, we need to get through in sixth grade and like, how that's changed off the years with trying to keep the kids like more invested and like, you know, it's meals. I mean, like, you could spend hours on scales with clarinet, you know, and it's like, the kids don't really, truly care about that anymore, but like, trying to like, have a balance between, you know, hey, I'm teaching you the scales and I'm kind of giving it to you. I did have kids this year that like, went with it, and they like learned stuff on their own, which I haven't had in the last few years, like, they wanted me to see them everything. So, you know, trying to keep the curriculum engaging and you know still getting what I need to get done but also like not pushing scales so much or whatever one part of my curriculum that they're like well I don't this is boring but I can't do this you know the kids that can't cross the break as well I can't you know. @14:17 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Now there's one's upon the time that I would send kids to the office for saying can't like I said it's a cuss word and we're gonna send it and I did that once actually it was the the front office people were in on the gag but we got the point across we we didn't have much of that but at the same time like that's the atrix and that works for a small class of kids that want to be good but how many you know of those classes do we actually have. Ariana or is there anything that you've kind of noticed in your teaching or like barriers to learning or challenges your kids are having and Ariana's gonna walk by the way yeah sorry back country road in Virginia. @14:53 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) We're not that well I mean I'm in a neighborhood. Okay. It was really interesting that she brought up Lauren, that she brought up the perfectionism mixed with the lack of interest and skills, because I will say that I've seen that quite bit over the last couple of years since we came back from COVID. My biggest like hurdle is talking, not me talking, but the students, even though they want to learn everything is still like somehow we've still forgotten to be in a classroom. And we can't get as much done because they just want to talk and then they get mad that they're not as good at something. If you let me finish explaining something so we could do it, then we'd be better at it. So that's really like for somebody who felt like I had pretty good classroom management skills for so long. The last couple of years have really kind of thrown me. And it's not just me like we're seeing it across the school, across the district. from what I've read in a lot of, you know, forums and stuff, it's a relatively common thing since we've come back. But yeah, just trying to get the interest, you know, you sign up for the class, you want to be here. So what is it that you want to do? And some of it's not going to be super fun. I always told my kids, especially at the orchestra, the first year is so boring. Oh my gosh, beginning at orchestra. And, you know, we can hear what band is playing next door and beginning dance is so much more exciting. And they can play full pieces that are like super exciting because everybody writes for the beginning dance. And nobody writes for the beginning orchestra. And I'm like, stick with it. Just trust me that after this year, it's going to be way more fun. And so then we don't, when we do our concerts and they hear seventh and eighth grade, like, oh, but getting them to that point. And even getting my son at the eighth graders to keep pushing through the conversation has just been, it's really thrown. me. And it kind of made me a little scattered and like, kind of keep myself on track when you're talking about curriculum and, you know, balancing the needs of your class was like, I wanted, I want to stay on this topic and get this done, but that's not, you can't always go to that because we've got to focus on the class. That made sense. @17:21 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Oh, totally does. And I mean, I think what both of you have touched on is, I wouldn't take these are new problems, right? These have always been things that kids do and kids struggle with, especially the talking because I'm finding out, um, starts earlier than I thought it did. So the, but like COVID has not been kind to any of this. And even before COVID, kids being raised on screens has not been kind to any of this. One of the things that screens are designed to do is distract like they're meant to engage you, not by getting into like some sort of flow state where like you or one with a machine and whatever is going on, it's much more like you're just constantly distracted being in a casino, basically. A casino of attention is what a lot of people have called it, and that only exacerbates the problems that we're seeing or the challenges we're seeing our kids experience. know, the perfectionism kind of comes from that. Like, if I don't, there's very low cost to quitting things when the next thing is just to swipe away, right? If all you have is like, I hate to sound like my father was like, all I had was a, you know, an old ball to play with. So you figured out things to do with the ball. There is some validity to that, that kids don't experience tension or friction or even just boredom. They are missing some tools, and that could show up really big in the areas where they're learning and trying new things. But then also like the just the attention to task and being on task and understanding how exchange happens in classrooms, especially when there's hormones involved, which, you know, beginners, that's about when that starts to do isn't fun. Didn't we plan that well? The that can be tricky as well. So it's like, to me, I'd plan to talk a lot more about like kind of general ideas about differentiation and stuff like that, but you're raising things that are kind of a little closer to stuff I've been thinking about. So with your permission, mean, we could just explore these as kind of the the test bed for the stuff we're talking about. And like the biggest thing, I think that comes to mind on things we're talking about quote unquote are, you know, when we're looking for the kid to do xyz, what is the thing we're looking for and how well defined is it in our brain? You know, whether that is an actual like definition like a rubric or how well formed is the target. behavior in our brain in terms of I could describe the qualities of it and I could also show you how far away you are from whatever it is that I'm evaluating you against. Like when we think about that in a musical sense we probably have a pretty good repertoire of things to pull from. But are those things we're pulling from always where the kids need them to be, right? In the sense that we have these kind of plans of action for like how to play this note better on an instrument. But if the kids are swirly or kind of everywhere where they crumble, like I always call them like paper children, they just kind of burst into flames when anything goes wrong. You know those kind of mechanisms we use to teach stuff like do these steps or do this thing or you know A to B to C to D might not work. And so it's adapting the outcomes we're looking for to not just the tools we have. The tools are probably pretty good. But how the students work themselves into the tools is kind of, I think, the missing piece that is something that we can spend some time talking about. And so let's go back to your example, Lauren, of kids just kind of crumbling when something goes wrong. normally the kids in that bottom third in terms of their skill acquisition. And there's already things acting on them that make that kind of heightened, maybe too, depending on the kid. And so, like, I guess my question is, like, what are some of the skills you're seeing them kind of hit as a wall? Is it like really, really routine basic stuff? Or is it more advanced skills or the combining stuff? where do you kind of see that wall happen if you see it happen in one place? @21:49 - Lauren Kaminski You know, I feel like it depends on the day. Like, for some kids, sometimes it's like they might just be having a bad day. And so they come in and it's like, okay, like I'm just. It's gonna, you know, let him be, you know, but I would say probably, I feel like, kind of in the beginning, I feel like everyone, you know, kind of gets the first skills that we're doing. It's probably once we start kind of, you know, spring semester when we're doing harder skill sets, but that's when stuff happens or, you know, I had a few kids like break down around the winter music when we were preparing that for the concert. So I would kind of say, you know, I guess higher level skills and like around the winter concert for some kids. @22:38 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So, and like if, if memory serves, because it's been a while since I've done a beginner here, so like that also is for you, does that involve the entire ensemble playing together for the first time? @22:51 - Lauren Kaminski Or do they still do lines out of the book? We do. Each class does a song. Their own song and then we have a unison line that the whole band does. together, and then we do one piece that has like two different parts going on. And I mean, like I have two different clarinet parts. So I'm like teaching clarinet parts for the first time and kind of explaining what first part is and second part is and that kind of thing. @23:16 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay. And I mean, that's, you know, for beginners, that's challenging. part of me has to wonder kind of getting back to the perfectionism, the kind of fragile child, paper children's syndrome. How much or is any of the challenges you're experienced exacerbated by the social dimension that's kind of rushing in, right? You're kind of in your little bubble of the flute class with clarinet class or whatever it is. And then you kind of, you know, lack of a better term, stir up the bowl of skittles and you see everything all mixed together and some kids, that is hugely destabilizing. Even kids that aren't diagnosed as being on the spectrum tend to function that way a little bit more because because they don't have the same social cues. didn't grow up with them the same way, and there's little bubble of them that's kind of floating through the educational system. what you're describing, we're gonna see in about six years, and with some modifications, maybe. So I mean, I wonder, is that playing into it at all, or do you think it's removed enough from that, that it's not a direct link? @24:23 - Lauren Kaminski I don't know, you know, I know like one kid that he like threw a fit one day with our class song, and the next day he came back, we had a test later on that week, and he played it, and he played it, and I looked at him, and I was like, you got an A, that was amazing, what'd you do? I went home and practiced, okay, so you throw on a fit the other day that you couldn't get it, it's just because you hadn't done your stuff at home. So, you know, and I think we do, so like our classes all meet at the same time, so we have three beginner classes going, and so like we'll come find them, especially for the winter stuff, it gets closer, so like, hey, this is kind of what you can see, you know? And so they get to kind of be with their friends and everything. But I don't know, I just think, you know, kids learn at different rates. I know I look like math, I wasn't good at math, and I always laughed because we did some like smart math thing in high school. And it was like, we started at late, so we were doing skills that we had already learned, and then we were doing other stuff. And so I was like finally getting good with smart math on the skills that we had already been tested over. So I know, like, kids do hit stuff. It's just a matter of like, what can I do to like help keep them thinking, keep them in line, and like, just not giving up on themselves learning wise, and the pace of the class going, and not letting the class stall out, while they try to like, figure stuff out. @25:56 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, and since you guys are spread so thin with having three simultaneous. these classes and three directors, right? like, that's not good. You can't be like, Oh, somebody coming to do this thing. You know, I have to wonder, especially because practice at home kind of becomes the thing of like, that, you know, see, that works, but they have to kind of find it on their own. They can't be told anything because heaven, defend that someone knows something they don't. But is there a way to do something worth like, that not working? Okay. And like, have a thing that they do, whether it's like shadow play or whatever, like give them a routine, you should move on to the next person, but give them like a set of behaviors to do that also reinforces what it's like to break down a problem, like the thing we teach them to do when, you know, before they take their instrument homes, like, here's kind of how you think through something that doesn't work, how to make it work better. And so maybe something along those lines might be helpful, because then that also, like, like, to me, practice time is @27:00 - Lauren Kaminski like work if you make it that way and that like it was something I have to do it's like this thing I have to check off rather than like I have this thing that's not working I'm going to go spend some time on it like we want the kids to get to that place but they've got to see the payoff and this cohort is really payoff averse in terms of like if it's not there right away it's the end of the world and I will say sometimes you know kids will help each other so it's like if they can tell I'll move on and they're co-person you know because I mix up the kids I somewhat sat them in share order and then I kind of mix kids around that could help other kids and so I would move on and they would the kid next to me be like hey it's you know you got to do and so they would kind of step in also but sometimes I mean kids would not accept it's like they're just trying to help you like I had a kid get upset one time that a friend was trying to help them but for the most part like kids are very accepting of like each other trying to help them and I'm like fine with that. I'm like, maybe they can say it better than I'm saying it, you know, or they can clarify. so if I see a kid, you know, reaching over and helping or, you know, the kid knows like, hey, this person's better than me, I'll move on and they're like, hey, can you show me X, Y, or Z? @28:17 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Well, I think that plays into also this idea. And we've talked about this before in this course of like bands and really all the ensemble traditions, but band orchestras, choirs are the big ones in the US that are these like organisms that don't exist in other ways, other places. So if you think about the music of, you know, pick any country where it's like, oh, the music of this thing that's not like what we have in the West, most of their ensembles are not 50, 60 people minimum, right? They're, they're, you know, a collection of eight to 12 people, kind of what we would call chamber group size. We have to, as band directors and orchestra directors and bar directors think about the social structure and the social dimension of what we're doing and having kids have the skills to accept that help and to go, okay, this person is not criticizing me. I remember Mr. you know, you always say like first thing is like, I give you feedback. It's information. It's not criticism. It's never about you. It's about what you're doing. He was always really kind of overly pointed about that. But at the same time, kids need that clear boundary too, because a lot of them do not pick up on subtlety anymore. sarcasm is really hard to come back as sarcasm lives on subtlety. And it's just not landing with the children these days, for whatever reason. And so, you know, like, to me, that might be something to explore of maybe on the first day, you know, this is something we do in our vamper and we help each other. And if you're not okay with that, here's what you say and you just have some sort of like, you know, it's like putting the red card up at a child, like, don't give me any more food. But for the rest of the kids, it's almost like, I'm actually listening to podcast about Richard Thaler, who won the Nobel Prize for creating behavioral economics, and they talk about how when you have a default choice that ups you into something, like over 90% of people just leave it, they don't question, I'm sure whatever that's fine, and maybe treating something like, because it sounds like the kind they feel like they have to get it with you, or all those lost, and so they don't have any other tools to lean back off that creates this kind of, for some of them, really panicky, heightened sense of, ooh, I'm not good enough, which heaven knows they already do anyways, we don't need to help that, it's already there. And so maybe even something to be like, you know, we help each other in this band program, and here's what it looks like, here's how you don't want it, here's what you say, if you do want it, you just let the other person start talking, and they know we do. you get to set the rules for what helping looks like. we use the same words we use in class, but we might explain them a little bit differently. It might even just be like that kid needs five reps and you have time for two to that day. You know, like, because I remember observing student teacher in your class, and like you had 20 some odd, like it was a big flute class, which is great that's what you want, but like there's one of you and you kind of are limited, but the size program you have and the way your structure is set up, like you've got to adapt to that, but if the kids aren't getting it, we have to find other ways. So building that sort of autonomy and I'm okay, if you don't get it with me, turn to your person next to you when you guys can workshop it together or whatever that looks like, however you want to have that to be set up. That might be an option because what you're doing there is you're differentiating the task by extending the time the student gets suspended, like it's classic, you know, one of the accommodations you'd put on an IEP that also who doesn't belabor the fact that we are usually one to 60 or one to 25 or one to whatever big ratio in our classroom. so like additional time doesn't always scale to what we need to get done. So that might be something to think about. And I think the other thing too, and this is something we all struggle with as teachers, is defining what the minimum, like what is the thing that we're going to go, okay, that's good for today. It's really hard for some kids to know what that is because in their brain, for whatever reason, if it's not perfect, then it's not good enough. Like they have a binary relationship with things. And so for us as teachers and as musicians to define, okay, here are the things we're going to use to describe what I want you to do. Here's what it sounds like when I demonstrate it, or it sounds like when someone else in the class demonstrates it. But here's other areas that are going to be good enough. Like sometimes kids need that. And it might not take more than two or three times to do something along the lines of that. So they start building this image of like, oh, there's a range of what's acceptable. There's a, it's not a, you know, bull's eye or nothing. Like, and we know, like, if they hold the sound still on that first day, we're really happy. Like, you're doing great, kid. But some of the kids are so scared. And we see this with the undergrads, too. Like, they are terrified to say something wrong, which that's been around forever. Like, I felt that way in music school. know you both did a high cost of being wrong in the school of music. But these kids are almost paralyzed by it. Because even more, even once it's clear that there are no stakes for saying something wrong and sense of like, you're going to be made fun of, they still do not want to put their money out there. They're really reticent to kind of bite at things. And then once they do, they do what you'd expect them to do. get really into it. It's great. but needing them to make that decision is hard. like you said, it's about making things sticky. Oh, there I am, must be home now. It's also about making things sticky in the sense of, we want the, I always tell the undergrads, like you're going remember about 10% of the things we do in this class. It's one of them to make sure that 10% you remember is the stuff that helps you the best. And so finding a way to make the things that really need to be sticky stick. So, you know, like you said, the basic fundamentals of things, kids tend to pick up really well and it's getting them to be comfortable with kind of putting things together, you know, like the two-headed monster on Sesame Street. Like these two skills that they do is together and becomes a new thing. And that also might be another place where letting them kind of have the freedom to spin out a little bit, not literally, figuratively, work with their person, can't beat you in the next round. And then you're going to have a couple kids make up. Like, you can play that however you work for your flow in your classroom. But I think giving them that autonomy, but then also showing them, you know, here's what it sounds like at the beginning, and it's kind of like at the end, and that's not all about just being here, it's about the growth to get there, and all the things we tell them to keep them engaged, because you know, those bottom kids, I don't know about you, but I was one of those bottom kids once, like, I wasn't always in the wind ensemble, especially when I switched instruments, I used to put trumpet, and then I figured, no, I'm not going to get a high enough chair doing that, so I switched to French horn, because that's what you could do in Pennsylvania at that time, because there was no competition for things like that, but you know, like these kids also deserve a visual experience, and so most of time it boils down to the quantity of time we don't have, and the way that we're spread so thin in our classroom, especially with beginners. You know the classroom control thing too is Like we have to we have to find her comfortable about that like we're taught really early on that the best classrooms are silent Right like if you're focused and they're studying and they're doing all the things I mean maybe sometimes that happens, but usually in the classrooms that I've felt like I've learned the most It's only like that sometimes. It's only like that when someone is talking You know like when everyone's listening while everyone's talking and then once that person's done talking There's a thing that happens whether it's we talk about their cells questions, it is Those tend to be the classrooms the interactive classrooms tend to be the ones that are More conducive to learning, but that's harder to do with big groups with middle schoolers Especially with beginner instrumentalists. It's like hurting cats that are on catnip so You know the the question there is you know, we're not even getting far enough into the higher or even needs to start talking about like transformational stuff. We're talking about like keeping the lights on and keeping shelter over our head, that these kids can't get passed, like just how to be in society. And so, you know, like where's the failing? I don't think there's anyone thinking we can point to, but what can we do to augment it? And so, you know, for that, if you tried going way back to basics and having them stand in hallway, Ariana, like right shoulder to the wall and quiet and all the things. @37:30 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) Oh yeah, like we've spent over half a class period at a time doing that. We've repeated it, you know, every other day since I don't see them every day, got over an emailed home reminder of things like it's all, I didn't sign up for the, I didn't look at it yet, but this got laying the backpack that he sent out this year, which is supposed to be like a last room agreement. type thing that you set up with your classes and so I was just curious and I was like let me sign up for it and see what it looks like in all of my free time which I clearly have since I'm doing my two mile walks at nine o'clock at night you know I have not looked at it yet so I'm curious just because maybe that's the thing that gets these kids this year I don't know as far as instructionally aside from talking if I can shift just slightly my biggest instructional issue outside of the talking has been transferring of skills like okay like I have had to because I had to pick up violin so quickly because I had no idea what I was doing I've even noticed this oftentimes I'll read in intervals instead of actually paying attention to the notes that are happening because I don't have time to think about what's happening as I'm trying to keep up with my eighth graders who are obviously playing more than I am at at their level because they get to spend more time teaching them music than playing it with them. But the transference of like, okay, you're going to play open one, two, and then guess what we're going to do on the next string? Open one, two, three, and everything goes up one letter in the alphabet. one or open one, three, four, unless it's base, in which case bases have to shift just to play one scale. It's a lot for them. But like, my students have not been able to, sorry, my husband just needs to bless you. I've not been able to transfer the idea of literally it's the exact same finger pattern on all four strings. All four, one letter at a time. Like, for some reason, especially this past year, like it never clicked, never. And I thought of every possible way that I could come up with to explain it. And I feel like I failed miserably. mean, we got through music by then, you know, when it was all said and done. But now I'm like, okay, how do we avoid that coming year? And it's to the point that I've actually thought about going slightly Suzuki and having them play notes before they see them on a staff. Not too far. Like I don't want them learning full pieces of music and then throwing, you know, at them. But like, okay, let's learn how to play Open D. Okay, here's what you just played and this is what it looks like. Because I thought maybe with this group, it was just too much information at once. I don't know. I can't, it can't hurt anything to try it that way. If I quickly see that it's not working, then we just shift gears and go back to, you know, Plan A. But that transference of knowledge, which I always felt like I was very good about stacking suddenly felt like I didn't know what I was doing at all because it just wasn't, it didn't click this year. And I think probably talking was a part of that where there was was never enough focused to just, oh, I'm doing the same thing over and over again. It just, there was never enough attention. I mean, I don't know, I grew up in a program that is like, I don't know about now, but at the time, hadn't gotten anything less than a superior and over 20 something years. didn't talk. Failure was not an option. It was, so that was what I was so used to. And I don't regret that. actually quite enjoyed it. It made me very competitive. I think it turned me into the better. I mean, I saw the kids when that, because they laugh, because I'll sing along to like essential elements, lines as band plays next door. And they're like, how do you know this? I'm like, well, know, back in the 1900s, when their music was on a cassette tape, I would rewind the track and I would practice for an hour. they're like, what is rewind me? What's like a sat tape? you practice for an hour. or I don't take my instrument home. like, there's that huge disconnect because obviously the teachers are the ones who we are those nerds who took our instruments home and worked all the time. And so trying to be like, okay, you didn't practice at home. Let's give you some time here. But also we do need to push forward and figuring out what didn't work last year and how to make it work this year. @42:27 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, I think the thing that stands out to me the most, there is, you know, transfer of learning is something that kind of is a course to water for a situation, right? Like you can't make, you can make them to a certain point, but then they have to be like, oh yeah, thing. Like I know the way I learned how to teach going over the break and not make it something scary was flip their instrument around. So I'm holding it in their mouth and I control everything. so they do the same error, do the exact same thing. And, you know, we do... Really basic limited stuff, but to show them like going to the break, you don't change anything. It's just your fingers and That kind of narrow the the attention of like things that are scary about this this Right, but that was just an demonstration in front of the kids like for whatever reason that stuck And I think you're doing the right thing around and like going I'm gonna try this one thing this year I'm gonna try this one try the contract within this year But I guess then then my question is like what is living kind of before that in in this chain of dominoes Like what is the thing that's typically the domino that makes you have to go get a behavioral contract? What are they coming in with something? Are they is it truly just to change in the students? Sorry everything just went to nighttime mode, so it's literally a little bit You know like Is there a change in the school culture if they're just a change in the way kids are like and this is where we all kind of Guard ourselves against sounding like our parents, but at the same time super generations of different personalities. So, where do you think your specific issue kind of lives maybe? @44:07 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) I mean, we are about to have our fourth superintendent in my 10 years here. We are on our third principle, not counting acting principles in the interim in my 10 years here. This past year so there was a big shift. doesn't explain sixth graders coming in necessarily because it didn't matter if he was new or not. Everybody, anybody would have been new to him. But a school culture shift and how we address, we have extremely high teacher turnover. This year I think we only lost, I'm probably going to get a from the other room in a minute, but I think only like 10 to 15. We usually it's closer to 30, and they're almost always brand new teachers, so the school culture alone is harder to address in one classroom when everybody's new and everybody's hair is on fire all the time, you know. Even if I might have my rules, they may or may not be the same as another teacher who has done this forever, who has never done this before, or isn't licensed to teach and has never been in school since they got out of school, you know, so it's a very I don't want to say it's a difficult school, it's not that, it's just that it's a difficult environment sometimes because it's changing constantly, there's a lack of consistency, so I think that's felt across the student body, whether they realize it or not, like obviously like I said the sixth graders won't feel that, it's just somewhere new for them. do feel like mature 30 levels are different. We're seeing this weird thing with technology, and I've told my kids before, like, it used to be like, when I got the internet, you know, way back when it was dialups, that if you wouldn't say something to somebody's face, you wouldn't say it online because it was mean, and now the kids are growing up saying mean things online first, and so they have no problem saying those things to people's faces because all the US trash talk each other online with their access to games and things like that, and so we're seeing some of that, and I was going somewhere else with that and I don't remember where. What was it? I don't know, but just the maturity. So we have this weird thing where they're exposed to things that they probably shouldn't be exposed to at younger ages, so in some ways like they're not necessarily more mature, but they've been around more mature things. But like Laura was saying, I have more kids that whose hands need to be held figuratively. They really are so scared of doing it wrong, or they've never had to problem-solve themselves. They need somebody to tell them every single step of the way, my kids just turn six, but when they're like three and four, I'm like, figure it out. don't solve the world's problems, but there's an issue in front of you that you're capable of solving what's solved it, and I always tell them, know, I'm giving you the tools you need to be successful. It's up to you to use them. And then kind of like you were saying with Mr. Green, like I always tell kids, like, it's not personal. I promise you, you'll know if it's personal, but I'm addressing something. It's just because it's something that needs to be fixed. It doesn't mean you're horrible. It doesn't mean you're a bad player or a bad person. Just means you did something wrong. got to address and we move on, and it's no big deal. And some kids take that very internal. and I'm like, I, as somebody who internalizes everything, I wouldn't do that to you. Like, because I understand what that would feel like. But yeah, just kind of feeling that, I think that is also part of that level of immaturity that we're seeing is that they don't know how to handle when we address them. They don't get that it's for the greater good, not because they're bad at something. It doesn't mean they're bad. It's just that your finger is low too. It's like, you know, mean going around with the trombones and it Pam, Pam Beasley from the office and it's like, second position, third position, what's the difference? They're the same thing, know, for my kids, it's low too. I, at our spring concert, I'm like, well, too, well, too to one of my violins this year, because she, you're playing regular too, but I'm like, it's like, try not to be loud enough for the audience to hear it. Right. Right, exactly. So just those There's little things without them taking it personally, but also just getting through it and applying it. @49:09 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, and I mean that's something where we maybe have to kind of help them and be much more maybe structured than we might otherwise want to be because like you pointed out Lauren, like some of these kids need to be handheld all the way through and maybe some of them don't come from homes where they have to think on their own, you know, like we've all come across the helicopter parent or the lawnmower parent or the bulldozer parent or whatever piece of construction equipment that we're talking about the parents operating to defend their child from all adversity. So we know what that's like, but you know, we also know we have to find a way ideally to integrate those kids into a group that is probably cut from different kids than them. And so a lot of times it's, you know, what's the pathway to this thing I need to do and there's actually some really interesting book you might have come across, some of them might not have come across others. There's three that have really stood out to me in recent kind of coinage, because there's a lot of these out here that are interesting but not actually helpful, and these kind of hit both targets of being interesting and helpful. The first one is this guy named Josh Weitzken, who if you've seen the movie Finding Bobby Fisher, like it's about this kid, like he was Trust Grandmaster at H14, like one of those mostly talented kids, and he wrote a book all about the way he learned, and you kind of have to grit your teeth, because he's very, it reads like maybe some other Silicon Valley people might read, that sort of, I am the god among men from Etheostown from the Mountain sort of thing, so you have to get past that, but he does a lot where he talks about this is one of the things I think that was really well for us as musicians of space repetition, like we're going to do this thing at this interval between and we do stuff in between, but then also this idea of incremental learning and breaking it down into the smallest piece. And like one of the things that I've pulled from that and I've tried to apply is how do we give the kids the tools to break down the thing that's challenging them into something they can't accomplish, and then something else they can accomplish, then they chain those things together into the third thing. And however many steps it takes, because we don't have the time to do that for them. wish we could in the best of all possible worlds we can, but that's not where we live. And so, you know, books like that, it's called The Art of Learning, and I'll send a summary over to you in the morning. It is, again, you have to kind of get around the tone that he writes with, but he does point some things out. And a lot of it is stuff that we as teachers can do more to install into our programs. And this is what I mean by that. We have a collection of kids in front of us at any given time, any ensemble, any class that can do things independent of us, and it's pretty rare that we take advantage of that in a meaningful way. When they play, they're doing stuff on their own, but that's kind of in coordination with us. We kind of are holding their hands in some ways there. But do we have any place for them to not be off the rails, but to have some autonomy, to have some areas to explore in so that we can teach them steps, like how to break this down into this thing, how to break this down into this thing without me being there. So what's the thing that's challenging you? I can't do that thing. Okay, what are the things we need to do to do that? for you, especially for you, Ariana, this actually might help you in becoming more familiar with kind of the extended parts of the instruments that you would, you know, if you're going to talk them through like a checklist almost. There's another great book. don't have a sorry this ready, but I can get it ready. Call the checklist manifestos by a doctor named Atul Gawande. Okay. Um, he's a, I think he was an ER doctor. could be wrong about that. What he found though was all of these surgical mistakes were coming about because everybody thought somebody else had done it. So they created basically a checklist to do these things where this person is going to walk out with gods in their body. So the stakes are a lot higher, but the idea of a kid being able to create like, okay, what are the things I'm doing to make this thing happen? Whatever it is, going, you know, doing a shift, whether it's playing an octave slur on flute, whether it's, you know, the chromatic scale that makes everyone cry on clarinet. You know, whatever it is, how, how can they focus down to the thing that is going to, once they fix it, be the news of difference. And I think empowering kids to have that is something that doesn't happen overnight. But if we have it as a goal, we start to develop kids that are helpful. one to themselves, but also other people, it can be more that when we help each other, this is what we fill it with. We were talking about that earlier, Lauren. But the other thing is that they are going to be assets to the group as well because they are not going to, unless it's really severe, add problems to the list of things. They're going to try and fix their own problems first. part of that is motivation. like you said, it's hard to get these kids excited about stuff because there's all this other noise happening in their lives. And the thing that kept on coming to mind there, and this doesn't apply equally in both situations at all, but this kind of idea that things outside of the room are in, outside of the orchestra, outside of band hall are chaos at any given time. They're just nuts. some time with hallways, you'll hear it. Come into our room, very ordered, where we have our things, we but then how much of that can we spin? and got a lot of energy into like, is it Miss Penny, whatever her name is in Matilda, the movie, the rolled doll movie, Miss Honey? Yeah, her. Yes. That like, not Miss Frizzle, what we can do Miss Frizzle little too easily. But Miss Honey, where it's like you are the the reason part of the reason why the kids come to your room is because it is that place where they feel safe and all these things. And I think we kind of get the safe space and all like the kind of leftist language kind of frets that down and makes it sound unappealing. But at the end of the day, how much can we project that to the kids? By the way, we teach them how to handle problems, right? The biggest problem with chaos is you don't know how to enter it to make anything make sense. But we'll teach you a way here to take the thing that's not making sense and at least find one step you can take to making it better and then take another step and another step. And that's hard. Like, I don't have an answer for what that looks like specifically. to each of us. But I think if we turn our attention to it, it'll ordeal itself. Because it's going to be built on the things you already know how to do well and feel comfortable getting kids to do. It's just a matter of getting them to use those same tools, and then check back in with you. Because that's the other thing you do is you introduce variability into what they decide to do with the thing. And so that's a question of training. Like when we start them off, when we have the conversation, same conversation maybe as we help each other in here is, here are the things we think are the most important. Our sound stays still, our sound is good, or whatever, however that lives. We work together, we never worked against each other, whatever that is. Because a lot of this I think is coming down to not the content we have, but how the kids connect and get into the content. Like what's their entry point? And I think you both identified that the entry point is, if not completely different, at least different enough that it doesn't. and map to what we've done before. And you're both a good enough teacher if you're finding your feet, in terms of making something work to make the thing happen using the old content and maybe a new way of approaching it. But I guess my question is, how can we take the content without changing it, without watering it down? you talked about Lauren, like nobody wants to do scales anymore. True, I I'm not sure they ever want to do scales. think we did them because we had to. But, and not even like, how can we make it fun and gamify? think that's gonna, you're gonna see a lot of technology solutions that are gonna do things like that for the reason you're pointing out. It's, you know, kids are just wondering. But how can we take the actual ideas themselves? Whether they're note names, whether they're, you know, pitch organizations, whether they're more higher-end things like style and articulation and make them stickier. So we don't have to basically re-teach them. over and over again. They stick and we can build on them. And one of the things is another book that you're going get a summary of is called Make It Stick. Can we either of you come across that before? It's actually really interesting book in the education space that talks about literally how people learn and one of the things it brings up to, similar to the first one we talk about, it's a space repetition of like we do it here and then we're going to wait little while and we do it here and we do it really intensely in those two spots, but we don't touch it in between which like for us as teachers scares us and it's probably not something you're going to apply to everything, but in both of these books explore what's kind of the boundary of things that are affected by this and where just the complexity of the task is too much, it doesn't work. So the other thing there too though is this idea of effortful learning like that you have to put some skin in the game, you have to try this thing and you know the other thing that I worked on kind of later in my career was this idea of you know if you don't think it's going to work but I'm asking you to do do it. I want you to at least try it. Just like when you're a little kid, you got some, you know, whatever the thing is, you don't want to eat. You just have to try a little bit of it. And if you do, fine. Because nine times out of ten, the thing that I wanted them to do, they didn't want to do, works. So it's more to get them over that. But then finding those levers with kids, I think, is a really important thing that they have to put some effort into it, but that the effort is returned by the positive reward. Now, part of that is where we set the reward. Is the reward playing the time of your scale? Or in the case of kids learning, you know, open one, one, three, four, whatever it is, that you can go, okay, next one's going to start on the G string. And like, hopefully it's not G string. But the, like, they have to jump and do the thing. And that's the reward there. It's not that they're learning it's transferable. that, oh, did that thing, and I did it fast and I did it faster than the next person, whatever it is. And so all of a sudden, then you can start to refine things, okay? Hey, now, it's not just who's fastest, who sounds the best, like you can start playing that game. And so it's a matter of, again, meeting them where they are, but not with the content. It's the pathway you create to the content. And heaven knows TikTok is not going to do us any favors in letting kids have longer attention spans moving forward. Like that's just not what happened, I don't think. And so it's up to us to find ways around that. And one of the ways we know is to return dopamine really, really quickly to get a kid hooked. It's the same thing as the candy does, same things that cigarettes do. It gets that dopamine loop happening. all of a sudden the kid is in it to win it. So it's finding those. And actually a third book and then a lead to be to consider picking up. this, if you don't buy any of the books, this I think is the best one to buy for what we do. It's called intelligent music teaching by a guy named Bob Duke. He is music at University of Texas. And well, music and human wondering is what they call it. They're because they want to be very specific. It's true. That's what they study and do a very good job of it. It has a lot of things in there that I think help clarify teaching. In fact, if I would never do it because it's his book, but I would love to teach a course just of this book for a summer thing, where it's kind of a pick up session, because it's these little essays. They're, I think, the longest is maybe 20 pages. it's all these different aspects of learning and how we learn the music and the things we assume are happening that maybe actually aren't happening in ways that we can think differently to be closer to what the kids are actually doing, but also kind of spin their effort back on itself to kind of build them into a little dynamo much faster. you want to think of it that way, it's a great book. It's pretty inexpensive. I think it's like maybe 18 bucks on Amazon and it's thin. It's very slender. It's just a little wisp of a book. But in terms of thinking about how students learn, I think that's a really great book to check out. I'll send you the outline where we talked through today, but all. So the summary and the transcript and book recommendations in the video tomorrow in the morning. Thank you guys for being here. It was good to see both of you. I'm glad you didn't get hit by a car this time, Ariana. ACTION ITEM: Send Lauren and Ariana summary and transcript of call, links to recommended books (The Art of Learning, Checklist Manifesto, Intelligent Music Teaching), and video recording - WATCH Not that you did last time, but there was concern and Lauren was good seeing you. @1:02:18 - Lauren Kaminski Yes, same. I was going to say about the candy and stuff. We started doing tetric boards before Christmas. And so I told the kids, I was like, all right, to earn a sticker, it's this tempo. If you want candy to try to like encourage more dexterity and fingers quicker, like it's this tempo. I mean, kids wanted that candy. mean, once the very first time we did like, no one really wanted to volunteer. So I kind of pushed on the kids that I knew would be successful and made them fall and told them. But it kind of like, you know, once the kids kind of saw like some success from other kids, like, I mean, they would come in, are we going to do tetra cords today? Are we going to get to, you know, It was just so funny that it's like candy tempo or a sticker tempo. Oh, tempo. @1:03:04 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You know, it's just amazing. @1:03:06 - Lauren Kaminski Candy does. @1:03:07 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Mm hmm. I mean, and that's the thing though, like, we're finding that even though these kids present very weirdly, they are the same kids we talked before. There's just a different pathway to get to what you've discovered. like the place where they get they do the thing that all kids do and they light up like a light bulb. Yeah. @1:03:23 - Lauren Kaminski ice cream sandwiches when we got when we got into scales, it was like, okay, with multiple octaves. So it was like, all right, if you get your region eight, and for the planets, I made it a six to make them feel a little more successful because their skills are harder. But I'm like, you get a star and an ice cream sandwich, and then you get your other scale sheet. And so then you can earn something else. And so that was my mildly successful, like I had planets that like, you know, wanted that ice cream sandwich. And so they got their six and then they finished, I helped them finish off their others. But it's just kind of, I'm like, always like, okay, what can like kind of put them in want to. And I, you know, I did videos for flutes and the other woodwind stuff I teach, I don't really do the videos, but with clarinets, there's so much specific like things, greens. I did videos and I posted them into our Schoology. And so some kids like, Hey, you can go rewatch this. Like we did it in class today. But guess what? talked about it and explain it in this video. So some kids would go and rewatch the video and some that would struggle in class. It's like, well, did you watch my video? Well, no, I guess I can. like, well, it's going to go step by step for you at home. It's like having me at your house trying to get them even just like use the Schoology videos. Like I made these videos. You know, I wish I don't think they got used as much. I know some students use them, but more kids would like buy into like, Hey, it's okay if I, you know, go home and figure this out or go home and she went over this in class. @1:04:56 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I didn't get it. And now it's in a literally a video. @1:05:00 - Lauren Kaminski I'm always like, how can I you know help and kind of like you said buy them in like get them get them in Yeah, and I mean that's amazing that you've done even not even what you've done. @1:05:12 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You've done like that is a lot of It's captured a couple kids along the way. I'm guessing It's like I think the other thing maybe that that we as teachers kind of need to wrap our branch around It's it's not pleasant is that these kids are like whereas before they were like maybe three or four things Everybody's into now. They're like thousands like they're into a little bit of everything It's what some theres called the long tail of the internet where like you can do with a thousand other people that like that very specific thing because the internet connects you from all over the world and so You know that we don't have those same pressures and things to pull on so I think anything you can do to Kind of help them is good But it might need to be a bunch of different things to capture a bunch of different kids You have in their classroom and so like this idea that we all have as teachers of the silver bullet that solves all the problems was never a reality before, but sometimes it worked. I think it's less than less effective now, and I think you touched on it really well, Lauren, with like having to do a bunch of different things to capture kind of enough kid that you see the progress you want to have. And I think that's, and if we're thinking about student learning, the first thing that is vital and central there is thinking about student learning. Like what are they doing, and how are they doing, and how can we, and you both do this, connect what they are doing with the steps they need to do, the thing we want them to accomplish. And sometimes it's a really easy transfer, sometimes it is a much further transfer, and so we need to kind of build back. But you know, the fact that one of the things that came up is this idea of community, this thing of culture, or this thing of, you know, help each other, like that starts to get into kind of the social emotional stuff too, which I know is, you know, anathema in some conversations, but at the same time, it's always been part of how we teach music and arts. so I think that's something to consider, too, that both of you from where you're talking sound like is installed in your thinking, always using everything as an opportunity to build on both at the same time. So where you're building community, it also helps the skill achievement or that sort of thing. Big brothers, big sisters, big buddies, whatever term you want to use for that might be a way to kind of want to extend your reach, or given that you're one person of how many, but two, allow you to kind of give those eighth graders that are chopping at the bit, something that is, there's consistently, it's not a special thing, so they can act like a twerp. They'll get out of the act feeling a twerp phase and get into actually being humans about it if you give them enough time. And so I think the stuff you both said you do is exactly what you need to do, but I don't need to do that because this stuff you do works. But at the end of the day, I think these three books are kind of good things to have in the back of your brain. But the thinking about it's not the content necessarily, the content is good, content works. know, the content has stood the test of time in a lot of ways to achieve the ends it wants to achieve. But are we then our job then becomes how do we connect the kids experience what they naturally gravitate towards and how they navigate the world with the stuff we want them to do. And those connection points kind of got fried during COVID in a lot of ways in ways that we're learning every year. So I don't envy you that. We're dealing with, you know, a lesser version of it just with way better hiding skills in the college. But at least you can identify what it is. And that gives you a much better chance of hitting the target now that you've figured out what it isn't. It's not the content. It's not your teaching. It's connecting the kids with the stuff you bring. And that's not easy. And hopefully these books, these outlines of this stuff will be a place for you to build a couple of ideas that work this year. @1:09:06 - Lauren Kaminski Yeah. Thanks. @1:09:08 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) It was very interesting. @1:09:10 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) The time went by fast. Cool. I'm happy to be a lovely waste of time. I will see. @1:09:17 - Lauren Kaminski I'm like, my brain's already kind of like turning. So it's kind of, you know, just a different way of thinking about next year. @1:09:24 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Good. Yeah. mean, that's really what this is supposed to be. @1:09:27 - Lauren Kaminski a way for us like it's yoga for your brain. @1:09:29 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah. don't have to think about me doing yoga. @1:09:33 - Lauren Kaminski would not be successful.

Key approaches include creating a supportive classroom environment where mistakes are normalized, using incremental learning steps, and providing focused practice opportunities. Allowing students autonomy in problem-solving and using varied incentives to increase motivation were also highlighted. Connecting musical content to students' lived experiences makes learning more accessible and engaging. Recommended resources for further insights included \"The Art of Learning,\" \"Make It Stick,\" and \"Intelligent Music Teaching.\" VIEW RECORDING - 70 mins (No highlights) Key Takeaways * Beginner music students often struggle with frustration, perfectionism, lack of focus, and difficulty transferring skills when learning new concepts and techniques. This can lead to shutting down or giving up easily. * Building a supportive classroom community where mistakes are normalized and students feel safe taking risks is crucial for their learning process. Peer support systems can be valuable. * Breaking down complex skills into incremental steps, providing focused practice opportunities, and celebrating small successes help students progress without getting overwhelmed. * Giving students some autonomy to problem-solve challenges independently or in pairs before intervening as the teacher can build their confidence and skills. * Using varied incentives and rewards that motivate students increases their engagement with effortful practice and learning. * Connecting the musical content meaningfully to students' lived experiences, interests, and existing skills makes it more accessible and \"sticky\" for retention. Topics Discussed Challenges Faced by Beginner Music Students The participants shared the common challenges their beginner students face in learning music: * Frustration and shutting down when unable to immediately grasp a new skill * Perfectionist mindsets - if they can't do it perfectly, they get discouraged * Lack of focused attention and excessive talking in class * Difficulty transferring skills across contexts (e.g. across strings on instruments) * Immaturity in independent problem-solving, expecting constant hand-holding * Struggles with combining or building on previously learned skills These challenges are likely exacerbated by factors like high teacher/school turnover disrupting consistent culture, student exposure to more mature content through technology, and changing student mindsets in the post-COVID world. Effective Strategies to Support Student Learning The educators discussed several promising strategies to facilitate beginner student learning: * Fostering a supportive classroom community where mistakes are normalized * Explicitly teaching routines for peer support and collaborative problem-solving * Breaking down complex tasks into incremental steps for scaffolded learning * Using varied incentives like food, rewards, and games to increase motivation * Allowing students autonomy to try solving challenges before intervening * Making musical concepts \"stickier\" through repetitive practice over time * Connecting abstract concepts to concrete skills/experiences students already have * Meeting students \"where they are\" by understanding their specific entry points * Framing the classroom as a safe space amidst external chaos Recommended Resources Cory recommended three books that provide research-based insights into how students learn: 1. \"The Art of Learning\" by Josh Waitzkin - Discusses strategies like spaced repetition and incremental learning 2. \"Make It Stick\" - Explores principles like effortful learning for retention 3. \"Intelligent Music Teaching\" by Robert Duke - Applies cognitive research to music learning specifically The key is understanding it's not necessarily the musical content that needs changing but developing effective pathways to make it engaging and accessible for today's students. Transcript @7:08 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay so speaking of doing things today we're gonna talk about this idea of student learning and kind of all the different ways it lives but talk about it from a perspective that recognizes what we bring as teachers and what our experience brings but also who kind of points our attention to other ways to consider learning or other ways to think about unpacking learning for the kids that already learning it for the first time or are experiencing challenges in their growth and that sort of thing. So you know the first thing and we all know this is that all growth especially learning is non-linear. like it's not an A to B to see the sort of situation with any kid, you know, if we think back to all the teaching we've done, how many kids actually do the build on the old skill in a really clean fashion across time? Like I am very few. And those kids tend to be just kids that are naturally gifted, but they're not very many of them. We're teaching more, should be teaching more to like the two thirds that are easily captureable, easily like if we tell them these things, these things will turn into the kids doing stuff really well. That's part of the what I call the magic words philosophy or like, oh, don't say soft, say, you know, whatever, like there are people for whom like the specific language are used is really important. And in some cases, in very much is. But and this is the crux of the issue here a lot of what we kind of think and bring into it can cloud our vision actually what's happening with the students. And what they are and aren't picking up on that we're laying down. And so, you know, this idea that we have to create this perfect learning environment actually might not be the thing that serves them the absolute best. You know, I've taught with people, I've done it myself where we kind of, we sit there and go, you know, my kids can't make mistakes. Mistakes aren't an option. And one of the things that we'll talk about today, but also just kind of in general, is that actually mistakes are one of more valuable things in the learning process as long as they are scappled in the same way, like we talk to our kids about making better mistakes. Don't make the same mistake over again. Make a better mistake next time. And that is actually, research is starting to show kind of what we all are experienced is, is that we learn best by experience and we learn best by that sort of granular understanding that comes from doing the thing. And then. anything else from that maybe doesn't really work so well so we're gonna cover little bit of how we adapt those skills and adapt the things that we ask our kids to do based on our deeper understanding of what it is we're actually asking them to do so I guess the first question I have for either of you is what you know when you're thinking about learning like one of the things we think about are the challenges to learn and so like what are some of the challenges you see in your classroom that are either present enough they come to mind first or were memorable enough that they come to mind first I would say kids just getting frustrated like beginner specifically you know it's like they can't get the task that day and so they get frustrated and then they shut down so like how can I do something else in order to make them like not shut down @12:00 - Lauren Kaminski And, you know, keep pushing the other kids because, you know, sometimes at that point in the year, you have your kids that are up here, you have your middle, and then you have your bottom. And so sometimes it seems more often than not, it's the bottom that is getting frustrated. And so how do you keep the bottom? Like, hey, it's okay that you, and I will say like having Mario, like he kind of taught me, like he would tell the kids like, hey, it's your first time doing this. Why are you so upset? And so I'm like, huh, that's an interesting mindset that not that I wasn't encouraging to them, but like, yeah, this can be like, you're doing fine for it, just being your first time, but just trying around, you know, helping those bottom kids, like, hey, it's okay, don't give up. You do have to like, you know, take home your instrument and practice five minutes. I bet this will help you increase. @12:51 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Right. And I mean, that definitely resonates with my experience too. anybody who's every time beginners anywhere knows. being the father of two, three children also is a telling thing that I've dealt with, that sort of instant perfectionism as the only option a lot. @13:10 - Lauren Kaminski yeah, it's like, I'm not good at this. And it's like, you just, we just did it. @13:14 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, it's gonna be an expert right now. This is your first day, it's okay. @13:18 - Lauren Kaminski So just trying to like, you know, and like, you know, with all the curriculum that in my mind, like, we need to get through in sixth grade and like, how that's changed off the years with trying to keep the kids like more invested and like, you know, it's meals. I mean, like, you could spend hours on scales with clarinet, you know, and it's like, the kids don't really, truly care about that anymore, but like, trying to like, have a balance between, you know, hey, I'm teaching you the scales and I'm kind of giving it to you. I did have kids this year that like, went with it, and they like learned stuff on their own, which I haven't had in the last few years, like, they wanted me to see them everything. So, you know, trying to keep the curriculum engaging and you know still getting what I need to get done but also like not pushing scales so much or whatever one part of my curriculum that they're like well I don't this is boring but I can't do this you know the kids that can't cross the break as well I can't you know. @14:17 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Now there's one's upon the time that I would send kids to the office for saying can't like I said it's a cuss word and we're gonna send it and I did that once actually it was the the front office people were in on the gag but we got the point across we we didn't have much of that but at the same time like that's the atrix and that works for a small class of kids that want to be good but how many you know of those classes do we actually have. Ariana or is there anything that you've kind of noticed in your teaching or like barriers to learning or challenges your kids are having and Ariana's gonna walk by the way yeah sorry back country road in Virginia. @14:53 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) We're not that well I mean I'm in a neighborhood. Okay. It was really interesting that she brought up Lauren, that she brought up the perfectionism mixed with the lack of interest and skills, because I will say that I've seen that quite bit over the last couple of years since we came back from COVID. My biggest like hurdle is talking, not me talking, but the students, even though they want to learn everything is still like somehow we've still forgotten to be in a classroom. And we can't get as much done because they just want to talk and then they get mad that they're not as good at something. If you let me finish explaining something so we could do it, then we'd be better at it. So that's really like for somebody who felt like I had pretty good classroom management skills for so long. The last couple of years have really kind of thrown me. And it's not just me like we're seeing it across the school, across the district. from what I've read in a lot of, you know, forums and stuff, it's a relatively common thing since we've come back. But yeah, just trying to get the interest, you know, you sign up for the class, you want to be here. So what is it that you want to do? And some of it's not going to be super fun. I always told my kids, especially at the orchestra, the first year is so boring. Oh my gosh, beginning at orchestra. And, you know, we can hear what band is playing next door and beginning dance is so much more exciting. And they can play full pieces that are like super exciting because everybody writes for the beginning dance. And nobody writes for the beginning orchestra. And I'm like, stick with it. Just trust me that after this year, it's going to be way more fun. And so then we don't, when we do our concerts and they hear seventh and eighth grade, like, oh, but getting them to that point. And even getting my son at the eighth graders to keep pushing through the conversation has just been, it's really thrown. me. And it kind of made me a little scattered and like, kind of keep myself on track when you're talking about curriculum and, you know, balancing the needs of your class was like, I wanted, I want to stay on this topic and get this done, but that's not, you can't always go to that because we've got to focus on the class. That made sense. @17:21 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Oh, totally does. And I mean, I think what both of you have touched on is, I wouldn't take these are new problems, right? These have always been things that kids do and kids struggle with, especially the talking because I'm finding out, um, starts earlier than I thought it did. So the, but like COVID has not been kind to any of this. And even before COVID, kids being raised on screens has not been kind to any of this. One of the things that screens are designed to do is distract like they're meant to engage you, not by getting into like some sort of flow state where like you or one with a machine and whatever is going on, it's much more like you're just constantly distracted being in a casino, basically. A casino of attention is what a lot of people have called it, and that only exacerbates the problems that we're seeing or the challenges we're seeing our kids experience. know, the perfectionism kind of comes from that. Like, if I don't, there's very low cost to quitting things when the next thing is just to swipe away, right? If all you have is like, I hate to sound like my father was like, all I had was a, you know, an old ball to play with. So you figured out things to do with the ball. There is some validity to that, that kids don't experience tension or friction or even just boredom. They are missing some tools, and that could show up really big in the areas where they're learning and trying new things. But then also like the just the attention to task and being on task and understanding how exchange happens in classrooms, especially when there's hormones involved, which, you know, beginners, that's about when that starts to do isn't fun. Didn't we plan that well? The that can be tricky as well. So it's like, to me, I'd plan to talk a lot more about like kind of general ideas about differentiation and stuff like that, but you're raising things that are kind of a little closer to stuff I've been thinking about. So with your permission, mean, we could just explore these as kind of the the test bed for the stuff we're talking about. And like the biggest thing, I think that comes to mind on things we're talking about quote unquote are, you know, when we're looking for the kid to do xyz, what is the thing we're looking for and how well defined is it in our brain? You know, whether that is an actual like definition like a rubric or how well formed is the target. behavior in our brain in terms of I could describe the qualities of it and I could also show you how far away you are from whatever it is that I'm evaluating you against. Like when we think about that in a musical sense we probably have a pretty good repertoire of things to pull from. But are those things we're pulling from always where the kids need them to be, right? In the sense that we have these kind of plans of action for like how to play this note better on an instrument. But if the kids are swirly or kind of everywhere where they crumble, like I always call them like paper children, they just kind of burst into flames when anything goes wrong. You know those kind of mechanisms we use to teach stuff like do these steps or do this thing or you know A to B to C to D might not work. And so it's adapting the outcomes we're looking for to not just the tools we have. The tools are probably pretty good. But how the students work themselves into the tools is kind of, I think, the missing piece that is something that we can spend some time talking about. And so let's go back to your example, Lauren, of kids just kind of crumbling when something goes wrong. normally the kids in that bottom third in terms of their skill acquisition. And there's already things acting on them that make that kind of heightened, maybe too, depending on the kid. And so, like, I guess my question is, like, what are some of the skills you're seeing them kind of hit as a wall? Is it like really, really routine basic stuff? Or is it more advanced skills or the combining stuff? where do you kind of see that wall happen if you see it happen in one place? @21:49 - Lauren Kaminski You know, I feel like it depends on the day. Like, for some kids, sometimes it's like they might just be having a bad day. And so they come in and it's like, okay, like I'm just. It's gonna, you know, let him be, you know, but I would say probably, I feel like, kind of in the beginning, I feel like everyone, you know, kind of gets the first skills that we're doing. It's probably once we start kind of, you know, spring semester when we're doing harder skill sets, but that's when stuff happens or, you know, I had a few kids like break down around the winter music when we were preparing that for the concert. So I would kind of say, you know, I guess higher level skills and like around the winter concert for some kids. @22:38 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So, and like if, if memory serves, because it's been a while since I've done a beginner here, so like that also is for you, does that involve the entire ensemble playing together for the first time? @22:51 - Lauren Kaminski Or do they still do lines out of the book? We do. Each class does a song. Their own song and then we have a unison line that the whole band does. together, and then we do one piece that has like two different parts going on. And I mean, like I have two different clarinet parts. So I'm like teaching clarinet parts for the first time and kind of explaining what first part is and second part is and that kind of thing. @23:16 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay. And I mean, that's, you know, for beginners, that's challenging. part of me has to wonder kind of getting back to the perfectionism, the kind of fragile child, paper children's syndrome. How much or is any of the challenges you're experienced exacerbated by the social dimension that's kind of rushing in, right? You're kind of in your little bubble of the flute class with clarinet class or whatever it is. And then you kind of, you know, lack of a better term, stir up the bowl of skittles and you see everything all mixed together and some kids, that is hugely destabilizing. Even kids that aren't diagnosed as being on the spectrum tend to function that way a little bit more because because they don't have the same social cues. didn't grow up with them the same way, and there's little bubble of them that's kind of floating through the educational system. what you're describing, we're gonna see in about six years, and with some modifications, maybe. So I mean, I wonder, is that playing into it at all, or do you think it's removed enough from that, that it's not a direct link? @24:23 - Lauren Kaminski I don't know, you know, I know like one kid that he like threw a fit one day with our class song, and the next day he came back, we had a test later on that week, and he played it, and he played it, and I looked at him, and I was like, you got an A, that was amazing, what'd you do? I went home and practiced, okay, so you throw on a fit the other day that you couldn't get it, it's just because you hadn't done your stuff at home. So, you know, and I think we do, so like our classes all meet at the same time, so we have three beginner classes going, and so like we'll come find them, especially for the winter stuff, it gets closer, so like, hey, this is kind of what you can see, you know? And so they get to kind of be with their friends and everything. But I don't know, I just think, you know, kids learn at different rates. I know I look like math, I wasn't good at math, and I always laughed because we did some like smart math thing in high school. And it was like, we started at late, so we were doing skills that we had already learned, and then we were doing other stuff. And so I was like finally getting good with smart math on the skills that we had already been tested over. So I know, like, kids do hit stuff. It's just a matter of like, what can I do to like help keep them thinking, keep them in line, and like, just not giving up on themselves learning wise, and the pace of the class going, and not letting the class stall out, while they try to like, figure stuff out. @25:56 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, and since you guys are spread so thin with having three simultaneous. these classes and three directors, right? like, that's not good. You can't be like, Oh, somebody coming to do this thing. You know, I have to wonder, especially because practice at home kind of becomes the thing of like, that, you know, see, that works, but they have to kind of find it on their own. They can't be told anything because heaven, defend that someone knows something they don't. But is there a way to do something worth like, that not working? Okay. And like, have a thing that they do, whether it's like shadow play or whatever, like give them a routine, you should move on to the next person, but give them like a set of behaviors to do that also reinforces what it's like to break down a problem, like the thing we teach them to do when, you know, before they take their instrument homes, like, here's kind of how you think through something that doesn't work, how to make it work better. And so maybe something along those lines might be helpful, because then that also, like, like, to me, practice time is @27:00 - Lauren Kaminski like work if you make it that way and that like it was something I have to do it's like this thing I have to check off rather than like I have this thing that's not working I'm going to go spend some time on it like we want the kids to get to that place but they've got to see the payoff and this cohort is really payoff averse in terms of like if it's not there right away it's the end of the world and I will say sometimes you know kids will help each other so it's like if they can tell I'll move on and they're co-person you know because I mix up the kids I somewhat sat them in share order and then I kind of mix kids around that could help other kids and so I would move on and they would the kid next to me be like hey it's you know you got to do and so they would kind of step in also but sometimes I mean kids would not accept it's like they're just trying to help you like I had a kid get upset one time that a friend was trying to help them but for the most part like kids are very accepting of like each other trying to help them and I'm like fine with that. I'm like, maybe they can say it better than I'm saying it, you know, or they can clarify. so if I see a kid, you know, reaching over and helping or, you know, the kid knows like, hey, this person's better than me, I'll move on and they're like, hey, can you show me X, Y, or Z? @28:17 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Well, I think that plays into also this idea. And we've talked about this before in this course of like bands and really all the ensemble traditions, but band orchestras, choirs are the big ones in the US that are these like organisms that don't exist in other ways, other places. So if you think about the music of, you know, pick any country where it's like, oh, the music of this thing that's not like what we have in the West, most of their ensembles are not 50, 60 people minimum, right? They're, they're, you know, a collection of eight to 12 people, kind of what we would call chamber group size. We have to, as band directors and orchestra directors and bar directors think about the social structure and the social dimension of what we're doing and having kids have the skills to accept that help and to go, okay, this person is not criticizing me. I remember Mr. you know, you always say like first thing is like, I give you feedback. It's information. It's not criticism. It's never about you. It's about what you're doing. He was always really kind of overly pointed about that. But at the same time, kids need that clear boundary too, because a lot of them do not pick up on subtlety anymore. sarcasm is really hard to come back as sarcasm lives on subtlety. And it's just not landing with the children these days, for whatever reason. And so, you know, like, to me, that might be something to explore of maybe on the first day, you know, this is something we do in our vamper and we help each other. And if you're not okay with that, here's what you say and you just have some sort of like, you know, it's like putting the red card up at a child, like, don't give me any more food. But for the rest of the kids, it's almost like, I'm actually listening to podcast about Richard Thaler, who won the Nobel Prize for creating behavioral economics, and they talk about how when you have a default choice that ups you into something, like over 90% of people just leave it, they don't question, I'm sure whatever that's fine, and maybe treating something like, because it sounds like the kind they feel like they have to get it with you, or all those lost, and so they don't have any other tools to lean back off that creates this kind of, for some of them, really panicky, heightened sense of, ooh, I'm not good enough, which heaven knows they already do anyways, we don't need to help that, it's already there. And so maybe even something to be like, you know, we help each other in this band program, and here's what it looks like, here's how you don't want it, here's what you say, if you do want it, you just let the other person start talking, and they know we do. you get to set the rules for what helping looks like. we use the same words we use in class, but we might explain them a little bit differently. It might even just be like that kid needs five reps and you have time for two to that day. You know, like, because I remember observing student teacher in your class, and like you had 20 some odd, like it was a big flute class, which is great that's what you want, but like there's one of you and you kind of are limited, but the size program you have and the way your structure is set up, like you've got to adapt to that, but if the kids aren't getting it, we have to find other ways. So building that sort of autonomy and I'm okay, if you don't get it with me, turn to your person next to you when you guys can workshop it together or whatever that looks like, however you want to have that to be set up. That might be an option because what you're doing there is you're differentiating the task by extending the time the student gets suspended, like it's classic, you know, one of the accommodations you'd put on an IEP that also who doesn't belabor the fact that we are usually one to 60 or one to 25 or one to whatever big ratio in our classroom. so like additional time doesn't always scale to what we need to get done. So that might be something to think about. And I think the other thing too, and this is something we all struggle with as teachers, is defining what the minimum, like what is the thing that we're going to go, okay, that's good for today. It's really hard for some kids to know what that is because in their brain, for whatever reason, if it's not perfect, then it's not good enough. Like they have a binary relationship with things. And so for us as teachers and as musicians to define, okay, here are the things we're going to use to describe what I want you to do. Here's what it sounds like when I demonstrate it, or it sounds like when someone else in the class demonstrates it. But here's other areas that are going to be good enough. Like sometimes kids need that. And it might not take more than two or three times to do something along the lines of that. So they start building this image of like, oh, there's a range of what's acceptable. There's a, it's not a, you know, bull's eye or nothing. Like, and we know, like, if they hold the sound still on that first day, we're really happy. Like, you're doing great, kid. But some of the kids are so scared. And we see this with the undergrads, too. Like, they are terrified to say something wrong, which that's been around forever. Like, I felt that way in music school. know you both did a high cost of being wrong in the school of music. But these kids are almost paralyzed by it. Because even more, even once it's clear that there are no stakes for saying something wrong and sense of like, you're going to be made fun of, they still do not want to put their money out there. They're really reticent to kind of bite at things. And then once they do, they do what you'd expect them to do. get really into it. It's great. but needing them to make that decision is hard. like you said, it's about making things sticky. Oh, there I am, must be home now. It's also about making things sticky in the sense of, we want the, I always tell the undergrads, like you're going remember about 10% of the things we do in this class. It's one of them to make sure that 10% you remember is the stuff that helps you the best. And so finding a way to make the things that really need to be sticky stick. So, you know, like you said, the basic fundamentals of things, kids tend to pick up really well and it's getting them to be comfortable with kind of putting things together, you know, like the two-headed monster on Sesame Street. Like these two skills that they do is together and becomes a new thing. And that also might be another place where letting them kind of have the freedom to spin out a little bit, not literally, figuratively, work with their person, can't beat you in the next round. And then you're going to have a couple kids make up. Like, you can play that however you work for your flow in your classroom. But I think giving them that autonomy, but then also showing them, you know, here's what it sounds like at the beginning, and it's kind of like at the end, and that's not all about just being here, it's about the growth to get there, and all the things we tell them to keep them engaged, because you know, those bottom kids, I don't know about you, but I was one of those bottom kids once, like, I wasn't always in the wind ensemble, especially when I switched instruments, I used to put trumpet, and then I figured, no, I'm not going to get a high enough chair doing that, so I switched to French horn, because that's what you could do in Pennsylvania at that time, because there was no competition for things like that, but you know, like these kids also deserve a visual experience, and so most of time it boils down to the quantity of time we don't have, and the way that we're spread so thin in our classroom, especially with beginners. You know the classroom control thing too is Like we have to we have to find her comfortable about that like we're taught really early on that the best classrooms are silent Right like if you're focused and they're studying and they're doing all the things I mean maybe sometimes that happens, but usually in the classrooms that I've felt like I've learned the most It's only like that sometimes. It's only like that when someone is talking You know like when everyone's listening while everyone's talking and then once that person's done talking There's a thing that happens whether it's we talk about their cells questions, it is Those tend to be the classrooms the interactive classrooms tend to be the ones that are More conducive to learning, but that's harder to do with big groups with middle schoolers Especially with beginner instrumentalists. It's like hurting cats that are on catnip so You know the the question there is you know, we're not even getting far enough into the higher or even needs to start talking about like transformational stuff. We're talking about like keeping the lights on and keeping shelter over our head, that these kids can't get passed, like just how to be in society. And so, you know, like where's the failing? I don't think there's anyone thinking we can point to, but what can we do to augment it? And so, you know, for that, if you tried going way back to basics and having them stand in hallway, Ariana, like right shoulder to the wall and quiet and all the things. @37:30 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) Oh yeah, like we've spent over half a class period at a time doing that. We've repeated it, you know, every other day since I don't see them every day, got over an emailed home reminder of things like it's all, I didn't sign up for the, I didn't look at it yet, but this got laying the backpack that he sent out this year, which is supposed to be like a last room agreement. type thing that you set up with your classes and so I was just curious and I was like let me sign up for it and see what it looks like in all of my free time which I clearly have since I'm doing my two mile walks at nine o'clock at night you know I have not looked at it yet so I'm curious just because maybe that's the thing that gets these kids this year I don't know as far as instructionally aside from talking if I can shift just slightly my biggest instructional issue outside of the talking has been transferring of skills like okay like I have had to because I had to pick up violin so quickly because I had no idea what I was doing I've even noticed this oftentimes I'll read in intervals instead of actually paying attention to the notes that are happening because I don't have time to think about what's happening as I'm trying to keep up with my eighth graders who are obviously playing more than I am at at their level because they get to spend more time teaching them music than playing it with them. But the transference of like, okay, you're going to play open one, two, and then guess what we're going to do on the next string? Open one, two, three, and everything goes up one letter in the alphabet. one or open one, three, four, unless it's base, in which case bases have to shift just to play one scale. It's a lot for them. But like, my students have not been able to, sorry, my husband just needs to bless you. I've not been able to transfer the idea of literally it's the exact same finger pattern on all four strings. All four, one letter at a time. Like, for some reason, especially this past year, like it never clicked, never. And I thought of every possible way that I could come up with to explain it. And I feel like I failed miserably. mean, we got through music by then, you know, when it was all said and done. But now I'm like, okay, how do we avoid that coming year? And it's to the point that I've actually thought about going slightly Suzuki and having them play notes before they see them on a staff. Not too far. Like I don't want them learning full pieces of music and then throwing, you know, at them. But like, okay, let's learn how to play Open D. Okay, here's what you just played and this is what it looks like. Because I thought maybe with this group, it was just too much information at once. I don't know. I can't, it can't hurt anything to try it that way. If I quickly see that it's not working, then we just shift gears and go back to, you know, Plan A. But that transference of knowledge, which I always felt like I was very good about stacking suddenly felt like I didn't know what I was doing at all because it just wasn't, it didn't click this year. And I think probably talking was a part of that where there was was never enough focused to just, oh, I'm doing the same thing over and over again. It just, there was never enough attention. I mean, I don't know, I grew up in a program that is like, I don't know about now, but at the time, hadn't gotten anything less than a superior and over 20 something years. didn't talk. Failure was not an option. It was, so that was what I was so used to. And I don't regret that. actually quite enjoyed it. It made me very competitive. I think it turned me into the better. I mean, I saw the kids when that, because they laugh, because I'll sing along to like essential elements, lines as band plays next door. And they're like, how do you know this? I'm like, well, know, back in the 1900s, when their music was on a cassette tape, I would rewind the track and I would practice for an hour. they're like, what is rewind me? What's like a sat tape? you practice for an hour. or I don't take my instrument home. like, there's that huge disconnect because obviously the teachers are the ones who we are those nerds who took our instruments home and worked all the time. And so trying to be like, okay, you didn't practice at home. Let's give you some time here. But also we do need to push forward and figuring out what didn't work last year and how to make it work this year. @42:27 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, I think the thing that stands out to me the most, there is, you know, transfer of learning is something that kind of is a course to water for a situation, right? Like you can't make, you can make them to a certain point, but then they have to be like, oh yeah, thing. Like I know the way I learned how to teach going over the break and not make it something scary was flip their instrument around. So I'm holding it in their mouth and I control everything. so they do the same error, do the exact same thing. And, you know, we do... Really basic limited stuff, but to show them like going to the break, you don't change anything. It's just your fingers and That kind of narrow the the attention of like things that are scary about this this Right, but that was just an demonstration in front of the kids like for whatever reason that stuck And I think you're doing the right thing around and like going I'm gonna try this one thing this year I'm gonna try this one try the contract within this year But I guess then then my question is like what is living kind of before that in in this chain of dominoes Like what is the thing that's typically the domino that makes you have to go get a behavioral contract? What are they coming in with something? Are they is it truly just to change in the students? Sorry everything just went to nighttime mode, so it's literally a little bit You know like Is there a change in the school culture if they're just a change in the way kids are like and this is where we all kind of Guard ourselves against sounding like our parents, but at the same time super generations of different personalities. So, where do you think your specific issue kind of lives maybe? @44:07 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) I mean, we are about to have our fourth superintendent in my 10 years here. We are on our third principle, not counting acting principles in the interim in my 10 years here. This past year so there was a big shift. doesn't explain sixth graders coming in necessarily because it didn't matter if he was new or not. Everybody, anybody would have been new to him. But a school culture shift and how we address, we have extremely high teacher turnover. This year I think we only lost, I'm probably going to get a from the other room in a minute, but I think only like 10 to 15. We usually it's closer to 30, and they're almost always brand new teachers, so the school culture alone is harder to address in one classroom when everybody's new and everybody's hair is on fire all the time, you know. Even if I might have my rules, they may or may not be the same as another teacher who has done this forever, who has never done this before, or isn't licensed to teach and has never been in school since they got out of school, you know, so it's a very I don't want to say it's a difficult school, it's not that, it's just that it's a difficult environment sometimes because it's changing constantly, there's a lack of consistency, so I think that's felt across the student body, whether they realize it or not, like obviously like I said the sixth graders won't feel that, it's just somewhere new for them. do feel like mature 30 levels are different. We're seeing this weird thing with technology, and I've told my kids before, like, it used to be like, when I got the internet, you know, way back when it was dialups, that if you wouldn't say something to somebody's face, you wouldn't say it online because it was mean, and now the kids are growing up saying mean things online first, and so they have no problem saying those things to people's faces because all the US trash talk each other online with their access to games and things like that, and so we're seeing some of that, and I was going somewhere else with that and I don't remember where. What was it? I don't know, but just the maturity. So we have this weird thing where they're exposed to things that they probably shouldn't be exposed to at younger ages, so in some ways like they're not necessarily more mature, but they've been around more mature things. But like Laura was saying, I have more kids that whose hands need to be held figuratively. They really are so scared of doing it wrong, or they've never had to problem-solve themselves. They need somebody to tell them every single step of the way, my kids just turn six, but when they're like three and four, I'm like, figure it out. don't solve the world's problems, but there's an issue in front of you that you're capable of solving what's solved it, and I always tell them, know, I'm giving you the tools you need to be successful. It's up to you to use them. And then kind of like you were saying with Mr. Green, like I always tell kids, like, it's not personal. I promise you, you'll know if it's personal, but I'm addressing something. It's just because it's something that needs to be fixed. It doesn't mean you're horrible. It doesn't mean you're a bad player or a bad person. Just means you did something wrong. got to address and we move on, and it's no big deal. And some kids take that very internal. and I'm like, I, as somebody who internalizes everything, I wouldn't do that to you. Like, because I understand what that would feel like. But yeah, just kind of feeling that, I think that is also part of that level of immaturity that we're seeing is that they don't know how to handle when we address them. They don't get that it's for the greater good, not because they're bad at something. It doesn't mean they're bad. It's just that your finger is low too. It's like, you know, mean going around with the trombones and it Pam, Pam Beasley from the office and it's like, second position, third position, what's the difference? They're the same thing, know, for my kids, it's low too. I, at our spring concert, I'm like, well, too, well, too to one of my violins this year, because she, you're playing regular too, but I'm like, it's like, try not to be loud enough for the audience to hear it. Right. Right, exactly. So just those There's little things without them taking it personally, but also just getting through it and applying it. @49:09 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, and I mean that's something where we maybe have to kind of help them and be much more maybe structured than we might otherwise want to be because like you pointed out Lauren, like some of these kids need to be handheld all the way through and maybe some of them don't come from homes where they have to think on their own, you know, like we've all come across the helicopter parent or the lawnmower parent or the bulldozer parent or whatever piece of construction equipment that we're talking about the parents operating to defend their child from all adversity. So we know what that's like, but you know, we also know we have to find a way ideally to integrate those kids into a group that is probably cut from different kids than them. And so a lot of times it's, you know, what's the pathway to this thing I need to do and there's actually some really interesting book you might have come across, some of them might not have come across others. There's three that have really stood out to me in recent kind of coinage, because there's a lot of these out here that are interesting but not actually helpful, and these kind of hit both targets of being interesting and helpful. The first one is this guy named Josh Weitzken, who if you've seen the movie Finding Bobby Fisher, like it's about this kid, like he was Trust Grandmaster at H14, like one of those mostly talented kids, and he wrote a book all about the way he learned, and you kind of have to grit your teeth, because he's very, it reads like maybe some other Silicon Valley people might read, that sort of, I am the god among men from Etheostown from the Mountain sort of thing, so you have to get past that, but he does a lot where he talks about this is one of the things I think that was really well for us as musicians of space repetition, like we're going to do this thing at this interval between and we do stuff in between, but then also this idea of incremental learning and breaking it down into the smallest piece. And like one of the things that I've pulled from that and I've tried to apply is how do we give the kids the tools to break down the thing that's challenging them into something they can't accomplish, and then something else they can accomplish, then they chain those things together into the third thing. And however many steps it takes, because we don't have the time to do that for them. wish we could in the best of all possible worlds we can, but that's not where we live. And so, you know, books like that, it's called The Art of Learning, and I'll send a summary over to you in the morning. It is, again, you have to kind of get around the tone that he writes with, but he does point some things out. And a lot of it is stuff that we as teachers can do more to install into our programs. And this is what I mean by that. We have a collection of kids in front of us at any given time, any ensemble, any class that can do things independent of us, and it's pretty rare that we take advantage of that in a meaningful way. When they play, they're doing stuff on their own, but that's kind of in coordination with us. We kind of are holding their hands in some ways there. But do we have any place for them to not be off the rails, but to have some autonomy, to have some areas to explore in so that we can teach them steps, like how to break this down into this thing, how to break this down into this thing without me being there. So what's the thing that's challenging you? I can't do that thing. Okay, what are the things we need to do to do that? for you, especially for you, Ariana, this actually might help you in becoming more familiar with kind of the extended parts of the instruments that you would, you know, if you're going to talk them through like a checklist almost. There's another great book. don't have a sorry this ready, but I can get it ready. Call the checklist manifestos by a doctor named Atul Gawande. Okay. Um, he's a, I think he was an ER doctor. could be wrong about that. What he found though was all of these surgical mistakes were coming about because everybody thought somebody else had done it. So they created basically a checklist to do these things where this person is going to walk out with gods in their body. So the stakes are a lot higher, but the idea of a kid being able to create like, okay, what are the things I'm doing to make this thing happen? Whatever it is, going, you know, doing a shift, whether it's playing an octave slur on flute, whether it's, you know, the chromatic scale that makes everyone cry on clarinet. You know, whatever it is, how, how can they focus down to the thing that is going to, once they fix it, be the news of difference. And I think empowering kids to have that is something that doesn't happen overnight. But if we have it as a goal, we start to develop kids that are helpful. one to themselves, but also other people, it can be more that when we help each other, this is what we fill it with. We were talking about that earlier, Lauren. But the other thing is that they are going to be assets to the group as well because they are not going to, unless it's really severe, add problems to the list of things. They're going to try and fix their own problems first. part of that is motivation. like you said, it's hard to get these kids excited about stuff because there's all this other noise happening in their lives. And the thing that kept on coming to mind there, and this doesn't apply equally in both situations at all, but this kind of idea that things outside of the room are in, outside of the orchestra, outside of band hall are chaos at any given time. They're just nuts. some time with hallways, you'll hear it. Come into our room, very ordered, where we have our things, we but then how much of that can we spin? and got a lot of energy into like, is it Miss Penny, whatever her name is in Matilda, the movie, the rolled doll movie, Miss Honey? Yeah, her. Yes. That like, not Miss Frizzle, what we can do Miss Frizzle little too easily. But Miss Honey, where it's like you are the the reason part of the reason why the kids come to your room is because it is that place where they feel safe and all these things. And I think we kind of get the safe space and all like the kind of leftist language kind of frets that down and makes it sound unappealing. But at the end of the day, how much can we project that to the kids? By the way, we teach them how to handle problems, right? The biggest problem with chaos is you don't know how to enter it to make anything make sense. But we'll teach you a way here to take the thing that's not making sense and at least find one step you can take to making it better and then take another step and another step. And that's hard. Like, I don't have an answer for what that looks like specifically. to each of us. But I think if we turn our attention to it, it'll ordeal itself. Because it's going to be built on the things you already know how to do well and feel comfortable getting kids to do. It's just a matter of getting them to use those same tools, and then check back in with you. Because that's the other thing you do is you introduce variability into what they decide to do with the thing. And so that's a question of training. Like when we start them off, when we have the conversation, same conversation maybe as we help each other in here is, here are the things we think are the most important. Our sound stays still, our sound is good, or whatever, however that lives. We work together, we never worked against each other, whatever that is. Because a lot of this I think is coming down to not the content we have, but how the kids connect and get into the content. Like what's their entry point? And I think you both identified that the entry point is, if not completely different, at least different enough that it doesn't. and map to what we've done before. And you're both a good enough teacher if you're finding your feet, in terms of making something work to make the thing happen using the old content and maybe a new way of approaching it. But I guess my question is, how can we take the content without changing it, without watering it down? you talked about Lauren, like nobody wants to do scales anymore. True, I I'm not sure they ever want to do scales. think we did them because we had to. But, and not even like, how can we make it fun and gamify? think that's gonna, you're gonna see a lot of technology solutions that are gonna do things like that for the reason you're pointing out. It's, you know, kids are just wondering. But how can we take the actual ideas themselves? Whether they're note names, whether they're, you know, pitch organizations, whether they're more higher-end things like style and articulation and make them stickier. So we don't have to basically re-teach them. over and over again. They stick and we can build on them. And one of the things is another book that you're going get a summary of is called Make It Stick. Can we either of you come across that before? It's actually really interesting book in the education space that talks about literally how people learn and one of the things it brings up to, similar to the first one we talk about, it's a space repetition of like we do it here and then we're going to wait little while and we do it here and we do it really intensely in those two spots, but we don't touch it in between which like for us as teachers scares us and it's probably not something you're going to apply to everything, but in both of these books explore what's kind of the boundary of things that are affected by this and where just the complexity of the task is too much, it doesn't work. So the other thing there too though is this idea of effortful learning like that you have to put some skin in the game, you have to try this thing and you know the other thing that I worked on kind of later in my career was this idea of you know if you don't think it's going to work but I'm asking you to do do it. I want you to at least try it. Just like when you're a little kid, you got some, you know, whatever the thing is, you don't want to eat. You just have to try a little bit of it. And if you do, fine. Because nine times out of ten, the thing that I wanted them to do, they didn't want to do, works. So it's more to get them over that. But then finding those levers with kids, I think, is a really important thing that they have to put some effort into it, but that the effort is returned by the positive reward. Now, part of that is where we set the reward. Is the reward playing the time of your scale? Or in the case of kids learning, you know, open one, one, three, four, whatever it is, that you can go, okay, next one's going to start on the G string. And like, hopefully it's not G string. But the, like, they have to jump and do the thing. And that's the reward there. It's not that they're learning it's transferable. that, oh, did that thing, and I did it fast and I did it faster than the next person, whatever it is. And so all of a sudden, then you can start to refine things, okay? Hey, now, it's not just who's fastest, who sounds the best, like you can start playing that game. And so it's a matter of, again, meeting them where they are, but not with the content. It's the pathway you create to the content. And heaven knows TikTok is not going to do us any favors in letting kids have longer attention spans moving forward. Like that's just not what happened, I don't think. And so it's up to us to find ways around that. And one of the ways we know is to return dopamine really, really quickly to get a kid hooked. It's the same thing as the candy does, same things that cigarettes do. It gets that dopamine loop happening. all of a sudden the kid is in it to win it. So it's finding those. And actually a third book and then a lead to be to consider picking up. this, if you don't buy any of the books, this I think is the best one to buy for what we do. It's called intelligent music teaching by a guy named Bob Duke. He is music at University of Texas. And well, music and human wondering is what they call it. They're because they want to be very specific. It's true. That's what they study and do a very good job of it. It has a lot of things in there that I think help clarify teaching. In fact, if I would never do it because it's his book, but I would love to teach a course just of this book for a summer thing, where it's kind of a pick up session, because it's these little essays. They're, I think, the longest is maybe 20 pages. it's all these different aspects of learning and how we learn the music and the things we assume are happening that maybe actually aren't happening in ways that we can think differently to be closer to what the kids are actually doing, but also kind of spin their effort back on itself to kind of build them into a little dynamo much faster. you want to think of it that way, it's a great book. It's pretty inexpensive. I think it's like maybe 18 bucks on Amazon and it's thin. It's very slender. It's just a little wisp of a book. But in terms of thinking about how students learn, I think that's a really great book to check out. I'll send you the outline where we talked through today, but all. So the summary and the transcript and book recommendations in the video tomorrow in the morning. Thank you guys for being here. It was good to see both of you. I'm glad you didn't get hit by a car this time, Ariana. ACTION ITEM: Send Lauren and Ariana summary and transcript of call, links to recommended books (The Art of Learning, Checklist Manifesto, Intelligent Music Teaching), and video recording - WATCH Not that you did last time, but there was concern and Lauren was good seeing you. @1:02:18 - Lauren Kaminski Yes, same. I was going to say about the candy and stuff. We started doing tetric boards before Christmas. And so I told the kids, I was like, all right, to earn a sticker, it's this tempo. If you want candy to try to like encourage more dexterity and fingers quicker, like it's this tempo. I mean, kids wanted that candy. mean, once the very first time we did like, no one really wanted to volunteer. So I kind of pushed on the kids that I knew would be successful and made them fall and told them. But it kind of like, you know, once the kids kind of saw like some success from other kids, like, I mean, they would come in, are we going to do tetra cords today? Are we going to get to, you know, It was just so funny that it's like candy tempo or a sticker tempo. Oh, tempo. @1:03:04 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You know, it's just amazing. @1:03:06 - Lauren Kaminski Candy does. @1:03:07 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Mm hmm. I mean, and that's the thing though, like, we're finding that even though these kids present very weirdly, they are the same kids we talked before. There's just a different pathway to get to what you've discovered. like the place where they get they do the thing that all kids do and they light up like a light bulb. Yeah. @1:03:23 - Lauren Kaminski ice cream sandwiches when we got when we got into scales, it was like, okay, with multiple octaves. So it was like, all right, if you get your region eight, and for the planets, I made it a six to make them feel a little more successful because their skills are harder. But I'm like, you get a star and an ice cream sandwich, and then you get your other scale sheet. And so then you can earn something else. And so that was my mildly successful, like I had planets that like, you know, wanted that ice cream sandwich. And so they got their six and then they finished, I helped them finish off their others. But it's just kind of, I'm like, always like, okay, what can like kind of put them in want to. And I, you know, I did videos for flutes and the other woodwind stuff I teach, I don't really do the videos, but with clarinets, there's so much specific like things, greens. I did videos and I posted them into our Schoology. And so some kids like, Hey, you can go rewatch this. Like we did it in class today. But guess what? talked about it and explain it in this video. So some kids would go and rewatch the video and some that would struggle in class. It's like, well, did you watch my video? Well, no, I guess I can. like, well, it's going to go step by step for you at home. It's like having me at your house trying to get them even just like use the Schoology videos. Like I made these videos. You know, I wish I don't think they got used as much. I know some students use them, but more kids would like buy into like, Hey, it's okay if I, you know, go home and figure this out or go home and she went over this in class. @1:04:56 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I didn't get it. And now it's in a literally a video. @1:05:00 - Lauren Kaminski I'm always like, how can I you know help and kind of like you said buy them in like get them get them in Yeah, and I mean that's amazing that you've done even not even what you've done. @1:05:12 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You've done like that is a lot of It's captured a couple kids along the way. I'm guessing It's like I think the other thing maybe that that we as teachers kind of need to wrap our branch around It's it's not pleasant is that these kids are like whereas before they were like maybe three or four things Everybody's into now. They're like thousands like they're into a little bit of everything It's what some theres called the long tail of the internet where like you can do with a thousand other people that like that very specific thing because the internet connects you from all over the world and so You know that we don't have those same pressures and things to pull on so I think anything you can do to Kind of help them is good But it might need to be a bunch of different things to capture a bunch of different kids You have in their classroom and so like this idea that we all have as teachers of the silver bullet that solves all the problems was never a reality before, but sometimes it worked. I think it's less than less effective now, and I think you touched on it really well, Lauren, with like having to do a bunch of different things to capture kind of enough kid that you see the progress you want to have. And I think that's, and if we're thinking about student learning, the first thing that is vital and central there is thinking about student learning. Like what are they doing, and how are they doing, and how can we, and you both do this, connect what they are doing with the steps they need to do, the thing we want them to accomplish. And sometimes it's a really easy transfer, sometimes it is a much further transfer, and so we need to kind of build back. But you know, the fact that one of the things that came up is this idea of community, this thing of culture, or this thing of, you know, help each other, like that starts to get into kind of the social emotional stuff too, which I know is, you know, anathema in some conversations, but at the same time, it's always been part of how we teach music and arts. so I think that's something to consider, too, that both of you from where you're talking sound like is installed in your thinking, always using everything as an opportunity to build on both at the same time. So where you're building community, it also helps the skill achievement or that sort of thing. Big brothers, big sisters, big buddies, whatever term you want to use for that might be a way to kind of want to extend your reach, or given that you're one person of how many, but two, allow you to kind of give those eighth graders that are chopping at the bit, something that is, there's consistently, it's not a special thing, so they can act like a twerp. They'll get out of the act feeling a twerp phase and get into actually being humans about it if you give them enough time. And so I think the stuff you both said you do is exactly what you need to do, but I don't need to do that because this stuff you do works. But at the end of the day, I think these three books are kind of good things to have in the back of your brain. But the thinking about it's not the content necessarily, the content is good, content works. know, the content has stood the test of time in a lot of ways to achieve the ends it wants to achieve. But are we then our job then becomes how do we connect the kids experience what they naturally gravitate towards and how they navigate the world with the stuff we want them to do. And those connection points kind of got fried during COVID in a lot of ways in ways that we're learning every year. So I don't envy you that. We're dealing with, you know, a lesser version of it just with way better hiding skills in the college. But at least you can identify what it is. And that gives you a much better chance of hitting the target now that you've figured out what it isn't. It's not the content. It's not your teaching. It's connecting the kids with the stuff you bring. And that's not easy. And hopefully these books, these outlines of this stuff will be a place for you to build a couple of ideas that work this year. @1:09:06 - Lauren Kaminski Yeah. Thanks. @1:09:08 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) It was very interesting. @1:09:10 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) The time went by fast. Cool. I'm happy to be a lovely waste of time. I will see. @1:09:17 - Lauren Kaminski I'm like, my brain's already kind of like turning. So it's kind of, you know, just a different way of thinking about next year. @1:09:24 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Good. Yeah. mean, that's really what this is supposed to be. @1:09:27 - Lauren Kaminski a way for us like it's yoga for your brain. @1:09:29 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah. don't have to think about me doing yoga. @1:09:33 - Lauren Kaminski would not be successful.

Key approaches include creating a supportive classroom environment where mistakes are normalized, using incremental learning steps, and providing focused practice opportunities. Allowing students autonomy in problem-solving and using varied incentives to increase motivation were also highlighted. Connecting musical content to students' lived experiences makes learning more accessible and engaging. Recommended resources for further insights included \"The Art of Learning,\" \"Make It Stick,\" and \"Intelligent Music Teaching.\" VIEW RECORDING - 70 mins (No highlights) Key Takeaways * Beginner music students often struggle with frustration, perfectionism, lack of focus, and difficulty transferring skills when learning new concepts and techniques. This can lead to shutting down or giving up easily. * Building a supportive classroom community where mistakes are normalized and students feel safe taking risks is crucial for their learning process. Peer support systems can be valuable. * Breaking down complex skills into incremental steps, providing focused practice opportunities, and celebrating small successes help students progress without getting overwhelmed. * Giving students some autonomy to problem-solve challenges independently or in pairs before intervening as the teacher can build their confidence and skills. * Using varied incentives and rewards that motivate students increases their engagement with effortful practice and learning. * Connecting the musical content meaningfully to students' lived experiences, interests, and existing skills makes it more accessible and \"sticky\" for retention. Topics Discussed Challenges Faced by Beginner Music Students The participants shared the common challenges their beginner students face in learning music: * Frustration and shutting down when unable to immediately grasp a new skill * Perfectionist mindsets - if they can't do it perfectly, they get discouraged * Lack of focused attention and excessive talking in class * Difficulty transferring skills across contexts (e.g. across strings on instruments) * Immaturity in independent problem-solving, expecting constant hand-holding * Struggles with combining or building on previously learned skills These challenges are likely exacerbated by factors like high teacher/school turnover disrupting consistent culture, student exposure to more mature content through technology, and changing student mindsets in the post-COVID world. Effective Strategies to Support Student Learning The educators discussed several promising strategies to facilitate beginner student learning: * Fostering a supportive classroom community where mistakes are normalized * Explicitly teaching routines for peer support and collaborative problem-solving * Breaking down complex tasks into incremental steps for scaffolded learning * Using varied incentives like food, rewards, and games to increase motivation * Allowing students autonomy to try solving challenges before intervening * Making musical concepts \"stickier\" through repetitive practice over time * Connecting abstract concepts to concrete skills/experiences students already have * Meeting students \"where they are\" by understanding their specific entry points * Framing the classroom as a safe space amidst external chaos Recommended Resources Cory recommended three books that provide research-based insights into how students learn: 1. \"The Art of Learning\" by Josh Waitzkin - Discusses strategies like spaced repetition and incremental learning 2. \"Make It Stick\" - Explores principles like effortful learning for retention 3. \"Intelligent Music Teaching\" by Robert Duke - Applies cognitive research to music learning specifically The key is understanding it's not necessarily the musical content that needs changing but developing effective pathways to make it engaging and accessible for today's students. Transcript @7:08 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay so speaking of doing things today we're gonna talk about this idea of student learning and kind of all the different ways it lives but talk about it from a perspective that recognizes what we bring as teachers and what our experience brings but also who kind of points our attention to other ways to consider learning or other ways to think about unpacking learning for the kids that already learning it for the first time or are experiencing challenges in their growth and that sort of thing. So you know the first thing and we all know this is that all growth especially learning is non-linear. like it's not an A to B to see the sort of situation with any kid, you know, if we think back to all the teaching we've done, how many kids actually do the build on the old skill in a really clean fashion across time? Like I am very few. And those kids tend to be just kids that are naturally gifted, but they're not very many of them. We're teaching more, should be teaching more to like the two thirds that are easily captureable, easily like if we tell them these things, these things will turn into the kids doing stuff really well. That's part of the what I call the magic words philosophy or like, oh, don't say soft, say, you know, whatever, like there are people for whom like the specific language are used is really important. And in some cases, in very much is. But and this is the crux of the issue here a lot of what we kind of think and bring into it can cloud our vision actually what's happening with the students. And what they are and aren't picking up on that we're laying down. And so, you know, this idea that we have to create this perfect learning environment actually might not be the thing that serves them the absolute best. You know, I've taught with people, I've done it myself where we kind of, we sit there and go, you know, my kids can't make mistakes. Mistakes aren't an option. And one of the things that we'll talk about today, but also just kind of in general, is that actually mistakes are one of more valuable things in the learning process as long as they are scappled in the same way, like we talk to our kids about making better mistakes. Don't make the same mistake over again. Make a better mistake next time. And that is actually, research is starting to show kind of what we all are experienced is, is that we learn best by experience and we learn best by that sort of granular understanding that comes from doing the thing. And then. anything else from that maybe doesn't really work so well so we're gonna cover little bit of how we adapt those skills and adapt the things that we ask our kids to do based on our deeper understanding of what it is we're actually asking them to do so I guess the first question I have for either of you is what you know when you're thinking about learning like one of the things we think about are the challenges to learn and so like what are some of the challenges you see in your classroom that are either present enough they come to mind first or were memorable enough that they come to mind first I would say kids just getting frustrated like beginner specifically you know it's like they can't get the task that day and so they get frustrated and then they shut down so like how can I do something else in order to make them like not shut down @12:00 - Lauren Kaminski And, you know, keep pushing the other kids because, you know, sometimes at that point in the year, you have your kids that are up here, you have your middle, and then you have your bottom. And so sometimes it seems more often than not, it's the bottom that is getting frustrated. And so how do you keep the bottom? Like, hey, it's okay that you, and I will say like having Mario, like he kind of taught me, like he would tell the kids like, hey, it's your first time doing this. Why are you so upset? And so I'm like, huh, that's an interesting mindset that not that I wasn't encouraging to them, but like, yeah, this can be like, you're doing fine for it, just being your first time, but just trying around, you know, helping those bottom kids, like, hey, it's okay, don't give up. You do have to like, you know, take home your instrument and practice five minutes. I bet this will help you increase. @12:51 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Right. And I mean, that definitely resonates with my experience too. anybody who's every time beginners anywhere knows. being the father of two, three children also is a telling thing that I've dealt with, that sort of instant perfectionism as the only option a lot. @13:10 - Lauren Kaminski yeah, it's like, I'm not good at this. And it's like, you just, we just did it. @13:14 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, it's gonna be an expert right now. This is your first day, it's okay. @13:18 - Lauren Kaminski So just trying to like, you know, and like, you know, with all the curriculum that in my mind, like, we need to get through in sixth grade and like, how that's changed off the years with trying to keep the kids like more invested and like, you know, it's meals. I mean, like, you could spend hours on scales with clarinet, you know, and it's like, the kids don't really, truly care about that anymore, but like, trying to like, have a balance between, you know, hey, I'm teaching you the scales and I'm kind of giving it to you. I did have kids this year that like, went with it, and they like learned stuff on their own, which I haven't had in the last few years, like, they wanted me to see them everything. So, you know, trying to keep the curriculum engaging and you know still getting what I need to get done but also like not pushing scales so much or whatever one part of my curriculum that they're like well I don't this is boring but I can't do this you know the kids that can't cross the break as well I can't you know. @14:17 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Now there's one's upon the time that I would send kids to the office for saying can't like I said it's a cuss word and we're gonna send it and I did that once actually it was the the front office people were in on the gag but we got the point across we we didn't have much of that but at the same time like that's the atrix and that works for a small class of kids that want to be good but how many you know of those classes do we actually have. Ariana or is there anything that you've kind of noticed in your teaching or like barriers to learning or challenges your kids are having and Ariana's gonna walk by the way yeah sorry back country road in Virginia. @14:53 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) We're not that well I mean I'm in a neighborhood. Okay. It was really interesting that she brought up Lauren, that she brought up the perfectionism mixed with the lack of interest and skills, because I will say that I've seen that quite bit over the last couple of years since we came back from COVID. My biggest like hurdle is talking, not me talking, but the students, even though they want to learn everything is still like somehow we've still forgotten to be in a classroom. And we can't get as much done because they just want to talk and then they get mad that they're not as good at something. If you let me finish explaining something so we could do it, then we'd be better at it. So that's really like for somebody who felt like I had pretty good classroom management skills for so long. The last couple of years have really kind of thrown me. And it's not just me like we're seeing it across the school, across the district. from what I've read in a lot of, you know, forums and stuff, it's a relatively common thing since we've come back. But yeah, just trying to get the interest, you know, you sign up for the class, you want to be here. So what is it that you want to do? And some of it's not going to be super fun. I always told my kids, especially at the orchestra, the first year is so boring. Oh my gosh, beginning at orchestra. And, you know, we can hear what band is playing next door and beginning dance is so much more exciting. And they can play full pieces that are like super exciting because everybody writes for the beginning dance. And nobody writes for the beginning orchestra. And I'm like, stick with it. Just trust me that after this year, it's going to be way more fun. And so then we don't, when we do our concerts and they hear seventh and eighth grade, like, oh, but getting them to that point. And even getting my son at the eighth graders to keep pushing through the conversation has just been, it's really thrown. me. And it kind of made me a little scattered and like, kind of keep myself on track when you're talking about curriculum and, you know, balancing the needs of your class was like, I wanted, I want to stay on this topic and get this done, but that's not, you can't always go to that because we've got to focus on the class. That made sense. @17:21 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Oh, totally does. And I mean, I think what both of you have touched on is, I wouldn't take these are new problems, right? These have always been things that kids do and kids struggle with, especially the talking because I'm finding out, um, starts earlier than I thought it did. So the, but like COVID has not been kind to any of this. And even before COVID, kids being raised on screens has not been kind to any of this. One of the things that screens are designed to do is distract like they're meant to engage you, not by getting into like some sort of flow state where like you or one with a machine and whatever is going on, it's much more like you're just constantly distracted being in a casino, basically. A casino of attention is what a lot of people have called it, and that only exacerbates the problems that we're seeing or the challenges we're seeing our kids experience. know, the perfectionism kind of comes from that. Like, if I don't, there's very low cost to quitting things when the next thing is just to swipe away, right? If all you have is like, I hate to sound like my father was like, all I had was a, you know, an old ball to play with. So you figured out things to do with the ball. There is some validity to that, that kids don't experience tension or friction or even just boredom. They are missing some tools, and that could show up really big in the areas where they're learning and trying new things. But then also like the just the attention to task and being on task and understanding how exchange happens in classrooms, especially when there's hormones involved, which, you know, beginners, that's about when that starts to do isn't fun. Didn't we plan that well? The that can be tricky as well. So it's like, to me, I'd plan to talk a lot more about like kind of general ideas about differentiation and stuff like that, but you're raising things that are kind of a little closer to stuff I've been thinking about. So with your permission, mean, we could just explore these as kind of the the test bed for the stuff we're talking about. And like the biggest thing, I think that comes to mind on things we're talking about quote unquote are, you know, when we're looking for the kid to do xyz, what is the thing we're looking for and how well defined is it in our brain? You know, whether that is an actual like definition like a rubric or how well formed is the target. behavior in our brain in terms of I could describe the qualities of it and I could also show you how far away you are from whatever it is that I'm evaluating you against. Like when we think about that in a musical sense we probably have a pretty good repertoire of things to pull from. But are those things we're pulling from always where the kids need them to be, right? In the sense that we have these kind of plans of action for like how to play this note better on an instrument. But if the kids are swirly or kind of everywhere where they crumble, like I always call them like paper children, they just kind of burst into flames when anything goes wrong. You know those kind of mechanisms we use to teach stuff like do these steps or do this thing or you know A to B to C to D might not work. And so it's adapting the outcomes we're looking for to not just the tools we have. The tools are probably pretty good. But how the students work themselves into the tools is kind of, I think, the missing piece that is something that we can spend some time talking about. And so let's go back to your example, Lauren, of kids just kind of crumbling when something goes wrong. normally the kids in that bottom third in terms of their skill acquisition. And there's already things acting on them that make that kind of heightened, maybe too, depending on the kid. And so, like, I guess my question is, like, what are some of the skills you're seeing them kind of hit as a wall? Is it like really, really routine basic stuff? Or is it more advanced skills or the combining stuff? where do you kind of see that wall happen if you see it happen in one place? @21:49 - Lauren Kaminski You know, I feel like it depends on the day. Like, for some kids, sometimes it's like they might just be having a bad day. And so they come in and it's like, okay, like I'm just. It's gonna, you know, let him be, you know, but I would say probably, I feel like, kind of in the beginning, I feel like everyone, you know, kind of gets the first skills that we're doing. It's probably once we start kind of, you know, spring semester when we're doing harder skill sets, but that's when stuff happens or, you know, I had a few kids like break down around the winter music when we were preparing that for the concert. So I would kind of say, you know, I guess higher level skills and like around the winter concert for some kids. @22:38 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So, and like if, if memory serves, because it's been a while since I've done a beginner here, so like that also is for you, does that involve the entire ensemble playing together for the first time? @22:51 - Lauren Kaminski Or do they still do lines out of the book? We do. Each class does a song. Their own song and then we have a unison line that the whole band does. together, and then we do one piece that has like two different parts going on. And I mean, like I have two different clarinet parts. So I'm like teaching clarinet parts for the first time and kind of explaining what first part is and second part is and that kind of thing. @23:16 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay. And I mean, that's, you know, for beginners, that's challenging. part of me has to wonder kind of getting back to the perfectionism, the kind of fragile child, paper children's syndrome. How much or is any of the challenges you're experienced exacerbated by the social dimension that's kind of rushing in, right? You're kind of in your little bubble of the flute class with clarinet class or whatever it is. And then you kind of, you know, lack of a better term, stir up the bowl of skittles and you see everything all mixed together and some kids, that is hugely destabilizing. Even kids that aren't diagnosed as being on the spectrum tend to function that way a little bit more because because they don't have the same social cues. didn't grow up with them the same way, and there's little bubble of them that's kind of floating through the educational system. what you're describing, we're gonna see in about six years, and with some modifications, maybe. So I mean, I wonder, is that playing into it at all, or do you think it's removed enough from that, that it's not a direct link? @24:23 - Lauren Kaminski I don't know, you know, I know like one kid that he like threw a fit one day with our class song, and the next day he came back, we had a test later on that week, and he played it, and he played it, and I looked at him, and I was like, you got an A, that was amazing, what'd you do? I went home and practiced, okay, so you throw on a fit the other day that you couldn't get it, it's just because you hadn't done your stuff at home. So, you know, and I think we do, so like our classes all meet at the same time, so we have three beginner classes going, and so like we'll come find them, especially for the winter stuff, it gets closer, so like, hey, this is kind of what you can see, you know? And so they get to kind of be with their friends and everything. But I don't know, I just think, you know, kids learn at different rates. I know I look like math, I wasn't good at math, and I always laughed because we did some like smart math thing in high school. And it was like, we started at late, so we were doing skills that we had already learned, and then we were doing other stuff. And so I was like finally getting good with smart math on the skills that we had already been tested over. So I know, like, kids do hit stuff. It's just a matter of like, what can I do to like help keep them thinking, keep them in line, and like, just not giving up on themselves learning wise, and the pace of the class going, and not letting the class stall out, while they try to like, figure stuff out. @25:56 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, and since you guys are spread so thin with having three simultaneous. these classes and three directors, right? like, that's not good. You can't be like, Oh, somebody coming to do this thing. You know, I have to wonder, especially because practice at home kind of becomes the thing of like, that, you know, see, that works, but they have to kind of find it on their own. They can't be told anything because heaven, defend that someone knows something they don't. But is there a way to do something worth like, that not working? Okay. And like, have a thing that they do, whether it's like shadow play or whatever, like give them a routine, you should move on to the next person, but give them like a set of behaviors to do that also reinforces what it's like to break down a problem, like the thing we teach them to do when, you know, before they take their instrument homes, like, here's kind of how you think through something that doesn't work, how to make it work better. And so maybe something along those lines might be helpful, because then that also, like, like, to me, practice time is @27:00 - Lauren Kaminski like work if you make it that way and that like it was something I have to do it's like this thing I have to check off rather than like I have this thing that's not working I'm going to go spend some time on it like we want the kids to get to that place but they've got to see the payoff and this cohort is really payoff averse in terms of like if it's not there right away it's the end of the world and I will say sometimes you know kids will help each other so it's like if they can tell I'll move on and they're co-person you know because I mix up the kids I somewhat sat them in share order and then I kind of mix kids around that could help other kids and so I would move on and they would the kid next to me be like hey it's you know you got to do and so they would kind of step in also but sometimes I mean kids would not accept it's like they're just trying to help you like I had a kid get upset one time that a friend was trying to help them but for the most part like kids are very accepting of like each other trying to help them and I'm like fine with that. I'm like, maybe they can say it better than I'm saying it, you know, or they can clarify. so if I see a kid, you know, reaching over and helping or, you know, the kid knows like, hey, this person's better than me, I'll move on and they're like, hey, can you show me X, Y, or Z? @28:17 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Well, I think that plays into also this idea. And we've talked about this before in this course of like bands and really all the ensemble traditions, but band orchestras, choirs are the big ones in the US that are these like organisms that don't exist in other ways, other places. So if you think about the music of, you know, pick any country where it's like, oh, the music of this thing that's not like what we have in the West, most of their ensembles are not 50, 60 people minimum, right? They're, they're, you know, a collection of eight to 12 people, kind of what we would call chamber group size. We have to, as band directors and orchestra directors and bar directors think about the social structure and the social dimension of what we're doing and having kids have the skills to accept that help and to go, okay, this person is not criticizing me. I remember Mr. you know, you always say like first thing is like, I give you feedback. It's information. It's not criticism. It's never about you. It's about what you're doing. He was always really kind of overly pointed about that. But at the same time, kids need that clear boundary too, because a lot of them do not pick up on subtlety anymore. sarcasm is really hard to come back as sarcasm lives on subtlety. And it's just not landing with the children these days, for whatever reason. And so, you know, like, to me, that might be something to explore of maybe on the first day, you know, this is something we do in our vamper and we help each other. And if you're not okay with that, here's what you say and you just have some sort of like, you know, it's like putting the red card up at a child, like, don't give me any more food. But for the rest of the kids, it's almost like, I'm actually listening to podcast about Richard Thaler, who won the Nobel Prize for creating behavioral economics, and they talk about how when you have a default choice that ups you into something, like over 90% of people just leave it, they don't question, I'm sure whatever that's fine, and maybe treating something like, because it sounds like the kind they feel like they have to get it with you, or all those lost, and so they don't have any other tools to lean back off that creates this kind of, for some of them, really panicky, heightened sense of, ooh, I'm not good enough, which heaven knows they already do anyways, we don't need to help that, it's already there. And so maybe even something to be like, you know, we help each other in this band program, and here's what it looks like, here's how you don't want it, here's what you say, if you do want it, you just let the other person start talking, and they know we do. you get to set the rules for what helping looks like. we use the same words we use in class, but we might explain them a little bit differently. It might even just be like that kid needs five reps and you have time for two to that day. You know, like, because I remember observing student teacher in your class, and like you had 20 some odd, like it was a big flute class, which is great that's what you want, but like there's one of you and you kind of are limited, but the size program you have and the way your structure is set up, like you've got to adapt to that, but if the kids aren't getting it, we have to find other ways. So building that sort of autonomy and I'm okay, if you don't get it with me, turn to your person next to you when you guys can workshop it together or whatever that looks like, however you want to have that to be set up. That might be an option because what you're doing there is you're differentiating the task by extending the time the student gets suspended, like it's classic, you know, one of the accommodations you'd put on an IEP that also who doesn't belabor the fact that we are usually one to 60 or one to 25 or one to whatever big ratio in our classroom. so like additional time doesn't always scale to what we need to get done. So that might be something to think about. And I think the other thing too, and this is something we all struggle with as teachers, is defining what the minimum, like what is the thing that we're going to go, okay, that's good for today. It's really hard for some kids to know what that is because in their brain, for whatever reason, if it's not perfect, then it's not good enough. Like they have a binary relationship with things. And so for us as teachers and as musicians to define, okay, here are the things we're going to use to describe what I want you to do. Here's what it sounds like when I demonstrate it, or it sounds like when someone else in the class demonstrates it. But here's other areas that are going to be good enough. Like sometimes kids need that. And it might not take more than two or three times to do something along the lines of that. So they start building this image of like, oh, there's a range of what's acceptable. There's a, it's not a, you know, bull's eye or nothing. Like, and we know, like, if they hold the sound still on that first day, we're really happy. Like, you're doing great, kid. But some of the kids are so scared. And we see this with the undergrads, too. Like, they are terrified to say something wrong, which that's been around forever. Like, I felt that way in music school. know you both did a high cost of being wrong in the school of music. But these kids are almost paralyzed by it. Because even more, even once it's clear that there are no stakes for saying something wrong and sense of like, you're going to be made fun of, they still do not want to put their money out there. They're really reticent to kind of bite at things. And then once they do, they do what you'd expect them to do. get really into it. It's great. but needing them to make that decision is hard. like you said, it's about making things sticky. Oh, there I am, must be home now. It's also about making things sticky in the sense of, we want the, I always tell the undergrads, like you're going remember about 10% of the things we do in this class. It's one of them to make sure that 10% you remember is the stuff that helps you the best. And so finding a way to make the things that really need to be sticky stick. So, you know, like you said, the basic fundamentals of things, kids tend to pick up really well and it's getting them to be comfortable with kind of putting things together, you know, like the two-headed monster on Sesame Street. Like these two skills that they do is together and becomes a new thing. And that also might be another place where letting them kind of have the freedom to spin out a little bit, not literally, figuratively, work with their person, can't beat you in the next round. And then you're going to have a couple kids make up. Like, you can play that however you work for your flow in your classroom. But I think giving them that autonomy, but then also showing them, you know, here's what it sounds like at the beginning, and it's kind of like at the end, and that's not all about just being here, it's about the growth to get there, and all the things we tell them to keep them engaged, because you know, those bottom kids, I don't know about you, but I was one of those bottom kids once, like, I wasn't always in the wind ensemble, especially when I switched instruments, I used to put trumpet, and then I figured, no, I'm not going to get a high enough chair doing that, so I switched to French horn, because that's what you could do in Pennsylvania at that time, because there was no competition for things like that, but you know, like these kids also deserve a visual experience, and so most of time it boils down to the quantity of time we don't have, and the way that we're spread so thin in our classroom, especially with beginners. You know the classroom control thing too is Like we have to we have to find her comfortable about that like we're taught really early on that the best classrooms are silent Right like if you're focused and they're studying and they're doing all the things I mean maybe sometimes that happens, but usually in the classrooms that I've felt like I've learned the most It's only like that sometimes. It's only like that when someone is talking You know like when everyone's listening while everyone's talking and then once that person's done talking There's a thing that happens whether it's we talk about their cells questions, it is Those tend to be the classrooms the interactive classrooms tend to be the ones that are More conducive to learning, but that's harder to do with big groups with middle schoolers Especially with beginner instrumentalists. It's like hurting cats that are on catnip so You know the the question there is you know, we're not even getting far enough into the higher or even needs to start talking about like transformational stuff. We're talking about like keeping the lights on and keeping shelter over our head, that these kids can't get passed, like just how to be in society. And so, you know, like where's the failing? I don't think there's anyone thinking we can point to, but what can we do to augment it? And so, you know, for that, if you tried going way back to basics and having them stand in hallway, Ariana, like right shoulder to the wall and quiet and all the things. @37:30 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) Oh yeah, like we've spent over half a class period at a time doing that. We've repeated it, you know, every other day since I don't see them every day, got over an emailed home reminder of things like it's all, I didn't sign up for the, I didn't look at it yet, but this got laying the backpack that he sent out this year, which is supposed to be like a last room agreement. type thing that you set up with your classes and so I was just curious and I was like let me sign up for it and see what it looks like in all of my free time which I clearly have since I'm doing my two mile walks at nine o'clock at night you know I have not looked at it yet so I'm curious just because maybe that's the thing that gets these kids this year I don't know as far as instructionally aside from talking if I can shift just slightly my biggest instructional issue outside of the talking has been transferring of skills like okay like I have had to because I had to pick up violin so quickly because I had no idea what I was doing I've even noticed this oftentimes I'll read in intervals instead of actually paying attention to the notes that are happening because I don't have time to think about what's happening as I'm trying to keep up with my eighth graders who are obviously playing more than I am at at their level because they get to spend more time teaching them music than playing it with them. But the transference of like, okay, you're going to play open one, two, and then guess what we're going to do on the next string? Open one, two, three, and everything goes up one letter in the alphabet. one or open one, three, four, unless it's base, in which case bases have to shift just to play one scale. It's a lot for them. But like, my students have not been able to, sorry, my husband just needs to bless you. I've not been able to transfer the idea of literally it's the exact same finger pattern on all four strings. All four, one letter at a time. Like, for some reason, especially this past year, like it never clicked, never. And I thought of every possible way that I could come up with to explain it. And I feel like I failed miserably. mean, we got through music by then, you know, when it was all said and done. But now I'm like, okay, how do we avoid that coming year? And it's to the point that I've actually thought about going slightly Suzuki and having them play notes before they see them on a staff. Not too far. Like I don't want them learning full pieces of music and then throwing, you know, at them. But like, okay, let's learn how to play Open D. Okay, here's what you just played and this is what it looks like. Because I thought maybe with this group, it was just too much information at once. I don't know. I can't, it can't hurt anything to try it that way. If I quickly see that it's not working, then we just shift gears and go back to, you know, Plan A. But that transference of knowledge, which I always felt like I was very good about stacking suddenly felt like I didn't know what I was doing at all because it just wasn't, it didn't click this year. And I think probably talking was a part of that where there was was never enough focused to just, oh, I'm doing the same thing over and over again. It just, there was never enough attention. I mean, I don't know, I grew up in a program that is like, I don't know about now, but at the time, hadn't gotten anything less than a superior and over 20 something years. didn't talk. Failure was not an option. It was, so that was what I was so used to. And I don't regret that. actually quite enjoyed it. It made me very competitive. I think it turned me into the better. I mean, I saw the kids when that, because they laugh, because I'll sing along to like essential elements, lines as band plays next door. And they're like, how do you know this? I'm like, well, know, back in the 1900s, when their music was on a cassette tape, I would rewind the track and I would practice for an hour. they're like, what is rewind me? What's like a sat tape? you practice for an hour. or I don't take my instrument home. like, there's that huge disconnect because obviously the teachers are the ones who we are those nerds who took our instruments home and worked all the time. And so trying to be like, okay, you didn't practice at home. Let's give you some time here. But also we do need to push forward and figuring out what didn't work last year and how to make it work this year. @42:27 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, I think the thing that stands out to me the most, there is, you know, transfer of learning is something that kind of is a course to water for a situation, right? Like you can't make, you can make them to a certain point, but then they have to be like, oh yeah, thing. Like I know the way I learned how to teach going over the break and not make it something scary was flip their instrument around. So I'm holding it in their mouth and I control everything. so they do the same error, do the exact same thing. And, you know, we do... Really basic limited stuff, but to show them like going to the break, you don't change anything. It's just your fingers and That kind of narrow the the attention of like things that are scary about this this Right, but that was just an demonstration in front of the kids like for whatever reason that stuck And I think you're doing the right thing around and like going I'm gonna try this one thing this year I'm gonna try this one try the contract within this year But I guess then then my question is like what is living kind of before that in in this chain of dominoes Like what is the thing that's typically the domino that makes you have to go get a behavioral contract? What are they coming in with something? Are they is it truly just to change in the students? Sorry everything just went to nighttime mode, so it's literally a little bit You know like Is there a change in the school culture if they're just a change in the way kids are like and this is where we all kind of Guard ourselves against sounding like our parents, but at the same time super generations of different personalities. So, where do you think your specific issue kind of lives maybe? @44:07 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) I mean, we are about to have our fourth superintendent in my 10 years here. We are on our third principle, not counting acting principles in the interim in my 10 years here. This past year so there was a big shift. doesn't explain sixth graders coming in necessarily because it didn't matter if he was new or not. Everybody, anybody would have been new to him. But a school culture shift and how we address, we have extremely high teacher turnover. This year I think we only lost, I'm probably going to get a from the other room in a minute, but I think only like 10 to 15. We usually it's closer to 30, and they're almost always brand new teachers, so the school culture alone is harder to address in one classroom when everybody's new and everybody's hair is on fire all the time, you know. Even if I might have my rules, they may or may not be the same as another teacher who has done this forever, who has never done this before, or isn't licensed to teach and has never been in school since they got out of school, you know, so it's a very I don't want to say it's a difficult school, it's not that, it's just that it's a difficult environment sometimes because it's changing constantly, there's a lack of consistency, so I think that's felt across the student body, whether they realize it or not, like obviously like I said the sixth graders won't feel that, it's just somewhere new for them. do feel like mature 30 levels are different. We're seeing this weird thing with technology, and I've told my kids before, like, it used to be like, when I got the internet, you know, way back when it was dialups, that if you wouldn't say something to somebody's face, you wouldn't say it online because it was mean, and now the kids are growing up saying mean things online first, and so they have no problem saying those things to people's faces because all the US trash talk each other online with their access to games and things like that, and so we're seeing some of that, and I was going somewhere else with that and I don't remember where. What was it? I don't know, but just the maturity. So we have this weird thing where they're exposed to things that they probably shouldn't be exposed to at younger ages, so in some ways like they're not necessarily more mature, but they've been around more mature things. But like Laura was saying, I have more kids that whose hands need to be held figuratively. They really are so scared of doing it wrong, or they've never had to problem-solve themselves. They need somebody to tell them every single step of the way, my kids just turn six, but when they're like three and four, I'm like, figure it out. don't solve the world's problems, but there's an issue in front of you that you're capable of solving what's solved it, and I always tell them, know, I'm giving you the tools you need to be successful. It's up to you to use them. And then kind of like you were saying with Mr. Green, like I always tell kids, like, it's not personal. I promise you, you'll know if it's personal, but I'm addressing something. It's just because it's something that needs to be fixed. It doesn't mean you're horrible. It doesn't mean you're a bad player or a bad person. Just means you did something wrong. got to address and we move on, and it's no big deal. And some kids take that very internal. and I'm like, I, as somebody who internalizes everything, I wouldn't do that to you. Like, because I understand what that would feel like. But yeah, just kind of feeling that, I think that is also part of that level of immaturity that we're seeing is that they don't know how to handle when we address them. They don't get that it's for the greater good, not because they're bad at something. It doesn't mean they're bad. It's just that your finger is low too. It's like, you know, mean going around with the trombones and it Pam, Pam Beasley from the office and it's like, second position, third position, what's the difference? They're the same thing, know, for my kids, it's low too. I, at our spring concert, I'm like, well, too, well, too to one of my violins this year, because she, you're playing regular too, but I'm like, it's like, try not to be loud enough for the audience to hear it. Right. Right, exactly. So just those There's little things without them taking it personally, but also just getting through it and applying it. @49:09 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, and I mean that's something where we maybe have to kind of help them and be much more maybe structured than we might otherwise want to be because like you pointed out Lauren, like some of these kids need to be handheld all the way through and maybe some of them don't come from homes where they have to think on their own, you know, like we've all come across the helicopter parent or the lawnmower parent or the bulldozer parent or whatever piece of construction equipment that we're talking about the parents operating to defend their child from all adversity. So we know what that's like, but you know, we also know we have to find a way ideally to integrate those kids into a group that is probably cut from different kids than them. And so a lot of times it's, you know, what's the pathway to this thing I need to do and there's actually some really interesting book you might have come across, some of them might not have come across others. There's three that have really stood out to me in recent kind of coinage, because there's a lot of these out here that are interesting but not actually helpful, and these kind of hit both targets of being interesting and helpful. The first one is this guy named Josh Weitzken, who if you've seen the movie Finding Bobby Fisher, like it's about this kid, like he was Trust Grandmaster at H14, like one of those mostly talented kids, and he wrote a book all about the way he learned, and you kind of have to grit your teeth, because he's very, it reads like maybe some other Silicon Valley people might read, that sort of, I am the god among men from Etheostown from the Mountain sort of thing, so you have to get past that, but he does a lot where he talks about this is one of the things I think that was really well for us as musicians of space repetition, like we're going to do this thing at this interval between and we do stuff in between, but then also this idea of incremental learning and breaking it down into the smallest piece. And like one of the things that I've pulled from that and I've tried to apply is how do we give the kids the tools to break down the thing that's challenging them into something they can't accomplish, and then something else they can accomplish, then they chain those things together into the third thing. And however many steps it takes, because we don't have the time to do that for them. wish we could in the best of all possible worlds we can, but that's not where we live. And so, you know, books like that, it's called The Art of Learning, and I'll send a summary over to you in the morning. It is, again, you have to kind of get around the tone that he writes with, but he does point some things out. And a lot of it is stuff that we as teachers can do more to install into our programs. And this is what I mean by that. We have a collection of kids in front of us at any given time, any ensemble, any class that can do things independent of us, and it's pretty rare that we take advantage of that in a meaningful way. When they play, they're doing stuff on their own, but that's kind of in coordination with us. We kind of are holding their hands in some ways there. But do we have any place for them to not be off the rails, but to have some autonomy, to have some areas to explore in so that we can teach them steps, like how to break this down into this thing, how to break this down into this thing without me being there. So what's the thing that's challenging you? I can't do that thing. Okay, what are the things we need to do to do that? for you, especially for you, Ariana, this actually might help you in becoming more familiar with kind of the extended parts of the instruments that you would, you know, if you're going to talk them through like a checklist almost. There's another great book. don't have a sorry this ready, but I can get it ready. Call the checklist manifestos by a doctor named Atul Gawande. Okay. Um, he's a, I think he was an ER doctor. could be wrong about that. What he found though was all of these surgical mistakes were coming about because everybody thought somebody else had done it. So they created basically a checklist to do these things where this person is going to walk out with gods in their body. So the stakes are a lot higher, but the idea of a kid being able to create like, okay, what are the things I'm doing to make this thing happen? Whatever it is, going, you know, doing a shift, whether it's playing an octave slur on flute, whether it's, you know, the chromatic scale that makes everyone cry on clarinet. You know, whatever it is, how, how can they focus down to the thing that is going to, once they fix it, be the news of difference. And I think empowering kids to have that is something that doesn't happen overnight. But if we have it as a goal, we start to develop kids that are helpful. one to themselves, but also other people, it can be more that when we help each other, this is what we fill it with. We were talking about that earlier, Lauren. But the other thing is that they are going to be assets to the group as well because they are not going to, unless it's really severe, add problems to the list of things. They're going to try and fix their own problems first. part of that is motivation. like you said, it's hard to get these kids excited about stuff because there's all this other noise happening in their lives. And the thing that kept on coming to mind there, and this doesn't apply equally in both situations at all, but this kind of idea that things outside of the room are in, outside of the orchestra, outside of band hall are chaos at any given time. They're just nuts. some time with hallways, you'll hear it. Come into our room, very ordered, where we have our things, we but then how much of that can we spin? and got a lot of energy into like, is it Miss Penny, whatever her name is in Matilda, the movie, the rolled doll movie, Miss Honey? Yeah, her. Yes. That like, not Miss Frizzle, what we can do Miss Frizzle little too easily. But Miss Honey, where it's like you are the the reason part of the reason why the kids come to your room is because it is that place where they feel safe and all these things. And I think we kind of get the safe space and all like the kind of leftist language kind of frets that down and makes it sound unappealing. But at the end of the day, how much can we project that to the kids? By the way, we teach them how to handle problems, right? The biggest problem with chaos is you don't know how to enter it to make anything make sense. But we'll teach you a way here to take the thing that's not making sense and at least find one step you can take to making it better and then take another step and another step. And that's hard. Like, I don't have an answer for what that looks like specifically. to each of us. But I think if we turn our attention to it, it'll ordeal itself. Because it's going to be built on the things you already know how to do well and feel comfortable getting kids to do. It's just a matter of getting them to use those same tools, and then check back in with you. Because that's the other thing you do is you introduce variability into what they decide to do with the thing. And so that's a question of training. Like when we start them off, when we have the conversation, same conversation maybe as we help each other in here is, here are the things we think are the most important. Our sound stays still, our sound is good, or whatever, however that lives. We work together, we never worked against each other, whatever that is. Because a lot of this I think is coming down to not the content we have, but how the kids connect and get into the content. Like what's their entry point? And I think you both identified that the entry point is, if not completely different, at least different enough that it doesn't. and map to what we've done before. And you're both a good enough teacher if you're finding your feet, in terms of making something work to make the thing happen using the old content and maybe a new way of approaching it. But I guess my question is, how can we take the content without changing it, without watering it down? you talked about Lauren, like nobody wants to do scales anymore. True, I I'm not sure they ever want to do scales. think we did them because we had to. But, and not even like, how can we make it fun and gamify? think that's gonna, you're gonna see a lot of technology solutions that are gonna do things like that for the reason you're pointing out. It's, you know, kids are just wondering. But how can we take the actual ideas themselves? Whether they're note names, whether they're, you know, pitch organizations, whether they're more higher-end things like style and articulation and make them stickier. So we don't have to basically re-teach them. over and over again. They stick and we can build on them. And one of the things is another book that you're going get a summary of is called Make It Stick. Can we either of you come across that before? It's actually really interesting book in the education space that talks about literally how people learn and one of the things it brings up to, similar to the first one we talk about, it's a space repetition of like we do it here and then we're going to wait little while and we do it here and we do it really intensely in those two spots, but we don't touch it in between which like for us as teachers scares us and it's probably not something you're going to apply to everything, but in both of these books explore what's kind of the boundary of things that are affected by this and where just the complexity of the task is too much, it doesn't work. So the other thing there too though is this idea of effortful learning like that you have to put some skin in the game, you have to try this thing and you know the other thing that I worked on kind of later in my career was this idea of you know if you don't think it's going to work but I'm asking you to do do it. I want you to at least try it. Just like when you're a little kid, you got some, you know, whatever the thing is, you don't want to eat. You just have to try a little bit of it. And if you do, fine. Because nine times out of ten, the thing that I wanted them to do, they didn't want to do, works. So it's more to get them over that. But then finding those levers with kids, I think, is a really important thing that they have to put some effort into it, but that the effort is returned by the positive reward. Now, part of that is where we set the reward. Is the reward playing the time of your scale? Or in the case of kids learning, you know, open one, one, three, four, whatever it is, that you can go, okay, next one's going to start on the G string. And like, hopefully it's not G string. But the, like, they have to jump and do the thing. And that's the reward there. It's not that they're learning it's transferable. that, oh, did that thing, and I did it fast and I did it faster than the next person, whatever it is. And so all of a sudden, then you can start to refine things, okay? Hey, now, it's not just who's fastest, who sounds the best, like you can start playing that game. And so it's a matter of, again, meeting them where they are, but not with the content. It's the pathway you create to the content. And heaven knows TikTok is not going to do us any favors in letting kids have longer attention spans moving forward. Like that's just not what happened, I don't think. And so it's up to us to find ways around that. And one of the ways we know is to return dopamine really, really quickly to get a kid hooked. It's the same thing as the candy does, same things that cigarettes do. It gets that dopamine loop happening. all of a sudden the kid is in it to win it. So it's finding those. And actually a third book and then a lead to be to consider picking up. this, if you don't buy any of the books, this I think is the best one to buy for what we do. It's called intelligent music teaching by a guy named Bob Duke. He is music at University of Texas. And well, music and human wondering is what they call it. They're because they want to be very specific. It's true. That's what they study and do a very good job of it. It has a lot of things in there that I think help clarify teaching. In fact, if I would never do it because it's his book, but I would love to teach a course just of this book for a summer thing, where it's kind of a pick up session, because it's these little essays. They're, I think, the longest is maybe 20 pages. it's all these different aspects of learning and how we learn the music and the things we assume are happening that maybe actually aren't happening in ways that we can think differently to be closer to what the kids are actually doing, but also kind of spin their effort back on itself to kind of build them into a little dynamo much faster. you want to think of it that way, it's a great book. It's pretty inexpensive. I think it's like maybe 18 bucks on Amazon and it's thin. It's very slender. It's just a little wisp of a book. But in terms of thinking about how students learn, I think that's a really great book to check out. I'll send you the outline where we talked through today, but all. So the summary and the transcript and book recommendations in the video tomorrow in the morning. Thank you guys for being here. It was good to see both of you. I'm glad you didn't get hit by a car this time, Ariana. ACTION ITEM: Send Lauren and Ariana summary and transcript of call, links to recommended books (The Art of Learning, Checklist Manifesto, Intelligent Music Teaching), and video recording - WATCH Not that you did last time, but there was concern and Lauren was good seeing you. @1:02:18 - Lauren Kaminski Yes, same. I was going to say about the candy and stuff. We started doing tetric boards before Christmas. And so I told the kids, I was like, all right, to earn a sticker, it's this tempo. If you want candy to try to like encourage more dexterity and fingers quicker, like it's this tempo. I mean, kids wanted that candy. mean, once the very first time we did like, no one really wanted to volunteer. So I kind of pushed on the kids that I knew would be successful and made them fall and told them. But it kind of like, you know, once the kids kind of saw like some success from other kids, like, I mean, they would come in, are we going to do tetra cords today? Are we going to get to, you know, It was just so funny that it's like candy tempo or a sticker tempo. Oh, tempo. @1:03:04 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You know, it's just amazing. @1:03:06 - Lauren Kaminski Candy does. @1:03:07 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Mm hmm. I mean, and that's the thing though, like, we're finding that even though these kids present very weirdly, they are the same kids we talked before. There's just a different pathway to get to what you've discovered. like the place where they get they do the thing that all kids do and they light up like a light bulb. Yeah. @1:03:23 - Lauren Kaminski ice cream sandwiches when we got when we got into scales, it was like, okay, with multiple octaves. So it was like, all right, if you get your region eight, and for the planets, I made it a six to make them feel a little more successful because their skills are harder. But I'm like, you get a star and an ice cream sandwich, and then you get your other scale sheet. And so then you can earn something else. And so that was my mildly successful, like I had planets that like, you know, wanted that ice cream sandwich. And so they got their six and then they finished, I helped them finish off their others. But it's just kind of, I'm like, always like, okay, what can like kind of put them in want to. And I, you know, I did videos for flutes and the other woodwind stuff I teach, I don't really do the videos, but with clarinets, there's so much specific like things, greens. I did videos and I posted them into our Schoology. And so some kids like, Hey, you can go rewatch this. Like we did it in class today. But guess what? talked about it and explain it in this video. So some kids would go and rewatch the video and some that would struggle in class. It's like, well, did you watch my video? Well, no, I guess I can. like, well, it's going to go step by step for you at home. It's like having me at your house trying to get them even just like use the Schoology videos. Like I made these videos. You know, I wish I don't think they got used as much. I know some students use them, but more kids would like buy into like, Hey, it's okay if I, you know, go home and figure this out or go home and she went over this in class. @1:04:56 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I didn't get it. And now it's in a literally a video. @1:05:00 - Lauren Kaminski I'm always like, how can I you know help and kind of like you said buy them in like get them get them in Yeah, and I mean that's amazing that you've done even not even what you've done. @1:05:12 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You've done like that is a lot of It's captured a couple kids along the way. I'm guessing It's like I think the other thing maybe that that we as teachers kind of need to wrap our branch around It's it's not pleasant is that these kids are like whereas before they were like maybe three or four things Everybody's into now. They're like thousands like they're into a little bit of everything It's what some theres called the long tail of the internet where like you can do with a thousand other people that like that very specific thing because the internet connects you from all over the world and so You know that we don't have those same pressures and things to pull on so I think anything you can do to Kind of help them is good But it might need to be a bunch of different things to capture a bunch of different kids You have in their classroom and so like this idea that we all have as teachers of the silver bullet that solves all the problems was never a reality before, but sometimes it worked. I think it's less than less effective now, and I think you touched on it really well, Lauren, with like having to do a bunch of different things to capture kind of enough kid that you see the progress you want to have. And I think that's, and if we're thinking about student learning, the first thing that is vital and central there is thinking about student learning. Like what are they doing, and how are they doing, and how can we, and you both do this, connect what they are doing with the steps they need to do, the thing we want them to accomplish. And sometimes it's a really easy transfer, sometimes it is a much further transfer, and so we need to kind of build back. But you know, the fact that one of the things that came up is this idea of community, this thing of culture, or this thing of, you know, help each other, like that starts to get into kind of the social emotional stuff too, which I know is, you know, anathema in some conversations, but at the same time, it's always been part of how we teach music and arts. so I think that's something to consider, too, that both of you from where you're talking sound like is installed in your thinking, always using everything as an opportunity to build on both at the same time. So where you're building community, it also helps the skill achievement or that sort of thing. Big brothers, big sisters, big buddies, whatever term you want to use for that might be a way to kind of want to extend your reach, or given that you're one person of how many, but two, allow you to kind of give those eighth graders that are chopping at the bit, something that is, there's consistently, it's not a special thing, so they can act like a twerp. They'll get out of the act feeling a twerp phase and get into actually being humans about it if you give them enough time. And so I think the stuff you both said you do is exactly what you need to do, but I don't need to do that because this stuff you do works. But at the end of the day, I think these three books are kind of good things to have in the back of your brain. But the thinking about it's not the content necessarily, the content is good, content works. know, the content has stood the test of time in a lot of ways to achieve the ends it wants to achieve. But are we then our job then becomes how do we connect the kids experience what they naturally gravitate towards and how they navigate the world with the stuff we want them to do. And those connection points kind of got fried during COVID in a lot of ways in ways that we're learning every year. So I don't envy you that. We're dealing with, you know, a lesser version of it just with way better hiding skills in the college. But at least you can identify what it is. And that gives you a much better chance of hitting the target now that you've figured out what it isn't. It's not the content. It's not your teaching. It's connecting the kids with the stuff you bring. And that's not easy. And hopefully these books, these outlines of this stuff will be a place for you to build a couple of ideas that work this year. @1:09:06 - Lauren Kaminski Yeah. Thanks. @1:09:08 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) It was very interesting. @1:09:10 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) The time went by fast. Cool. I'm happy to be a lovely waste of time. I will see. @1:09:17 - Lauren Kaminski I'm like, my brain's already kind of like turning. So it's kind of, you know, just a different way of thinking about next year. @1:09:24 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Good. Yeah. mean, that's really what this is supposed to be. @1:09:27 - Lauren Kaminski a way for us like it's yoga for your brain. @1:09:29 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah. don't have to think about me doing yoga. @1:09:33 - Lauren Kaminski would not be successful.

Key approaches include creating a supportive classroom environment where mistakes are normalized, using incremental learning steps, and providing focused practice opportunities. Allowing students autonomy in problem-solving and using varied incentives to increase motivation were also highlighted. Connecting musical content to students' lived experiences makes learning more accessible and engaging. Recommended resources for further insights included \"The Art of Learning,\" \"Make It Stick,\" and \"Intelligent Music Teaching.\" VIEW RECORDING - 70 mins (No highlights) Key Takeaways * Beginner music students often struggle with frustration, perfectionism, lack of focus, and difficulty transferring skills when learning new concepts and techniques. This can lead to shutting down or giving up easily. * Building a supportive classroom community where mistakes are normalized and students feel safe taking risks is crucial for their learning process. Peer support systems can be valuable. * Breaking down complex skills into incremental steps, providing focused practice opportunities, and celebrating small successes help students progress without getting overwhelmed. * Giving students some autonomy to problem-solve challenges independently or in pairs before intervening as the teacher can build their confidence and skills. * Using varied incentives and rewards that motivate students increases their engagement with effortful practice and learning. * Connecting the musical content meaningfully to students' lived experiences, interests, and existing skills makes it more accessible and \"sticky\" for retention. Topics Discussed Challenges Faced by Beginner Music Students The participants shared the common challenges their beginner students face in learning music: * Frustration and shutting down when unable to immediately grasp a new skill * Perfectionist mindsets - if they can't do it perfectly, they get discouraged * Lack of focused attention and excessive talking in class * Difficulty transferring skills across contexts (e.g. across strings on instruments) * Immaturity in independent problem-solving, expecting constant hand-holding * Struggles with combining or building on previously learned skills These challenges are likely exacerbated by factors like high teacher/school turnover disrupting consistent culture, student exposure to more mature content through technology, and changing student mindsets in the post-COVID world. Effective Strategies to Support Student Learning The educators discussed several promising strategies to facilitate beginner student learning: * Fostering a supportive classroom community where mistakes are normalized * Explicitly teaching routines for peer support and collaborative problem-solving * Breaking down complex tasks into incremental steps for scaffolded learning * Using varied incentives like food, rewards, and games to increase motivation * Allowing students autonomy to try solving challenges before intervening * Making musical concepts \"stickier\" through repetitive practice over time * Connecting abstract concepts to concrete skills/experiences students already have * Meeting students \"where they are\" by understanding their specific entry points * Framing the classroom as a safe space amidst external chaos Recommended Resources Cory recommended three books that provide research-based insights into how students learn: 1. \"The Art of Learning\" by Josh Waitzkin - Discusses strategies like spaced repetition and incremental learning 2. \"Make It Stick\" - Explores principles like effortful learning for retention 3. \"Intelligent Music Teaching\" by Robert Duke - Applies cognitive research to music learning specifically The key is understanding it's not necessarily the musical content that needs changing but developing effective pathways to make it engaging and accessible for today's students. Transcript @7:08 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay so speaking of doing things today we're gonna talk about this idea of student learning and kind of all the different ways it lives but talk about it from a perspective that recognizes what we bring as teachers and what our experience brings but also who kind of points our attention to other ways to consider learning or other ways to think about unpacking learning for the kids that already learning it for the first time or are experiencing challenges in their growth and that sort of thing. So you know the first thing and we all know this is that all growth especially learning is non-linear. like it's not an A to B to see the sort of situation with any kid, you know, if we think back to all the teaching we've done, how many kids actually do the build on the old skill in a really clean fashion across time? Like I am very few. And those kids tend to be just kids that are naturally gifted, but they're not very many of them. We're teaching more, should be teaching more to like the two thirds that are easily captureable, easily like if we tell them these things, these things will turn into the kids doing stuff really well. That's part of the what I call the magic words philosophy or like, oh, don't say soft, say, you know, whatever, like there are people for whom like the specific language are used is really important. And in some cases, in very much is. But and this is the crux of the issue here a lot of what we kind of think and bring into it can cloud our vision actually what's happening with the students. And what they are and aren't picking up on that we're laying down. And so, you know, this idea that we have to create this perfect learning environment actually might not be the thing that serves them the absolute best. You know, I've taught with people, I've done it myself where we kind of, we sit there and go, you know, my kids can't make mistakes. Mistakes aren't an option. And one of the things that we'll talk about today, but also just kind of in general, is that actually mistakes are one of more valuable things in the learning process as long as they are scappled in the same way, like we talk to our kids about making better mistakes. Don't make the same mistake over again. Make a better mistake next time. And that is actually, research is starting to show kind of what we all are experienced is, is that we learn best by experience and we learn best by that sort of granular understanding that comes from doing the thing. And then. anything else from that maybe doesn't really work so well so we're gonna cover little bit of how we adapt those skills and adapt the things that we ask our kids to do based on our deeper understanding of what it is we're actually asking them to do so I guess the first question I have for either of you is what you know when you're thinking about learning like one of the things we think about are the challenges to learn and so like what are some of the challenges you see in your classroom that are either present enough they come to mind first or were memorable enough that they come to mind first I would say kids just getting frustrated like beginner specifically you know it's like they can't get the task that day and so they get frustrated and then they shut down so like how can I do something else in order to make them like not shut down @12:00 - Lauren Kaminski And, you know, keep pushing the other kids because, you know, sometimes at that point in the year, you have your kids that are up here, you have your middle, and then you have your bottom. And so sometimes it seems more often than not, it's the bottom that is getting frustrated. And so how do you keep the bottom? Like, hey, it's okay that you, and I will say like having Mario, like he kind of taught me, like he would tell the kids like, hey, it's your first time doing this. Why are you so upset? And so I'm like, huh, that's an interesting mindset that not that I wasn't encouraging to them, but like, yeah, this can be like, you're doing fine for it, just being your first time, but just trying around, you know, helping those bottom kids, like, hey, it's okay, don't give up. You do have to like, you know, take home your instrument and practice five minutes. I bet this will help you increase. @12:51 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Right. And I mean, that definitely resonates with my experience too. anybody who's every time beginners anywhere knows. being the father of two, three children also is a telling thing that I've dealt with, that sort of instant perfectionism as the only option a lot. @13:10 - Lauren Kaminski yeah, it's like, I'm not good at this. And it's like, you just, we just did it. @13:14 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, it's gonna be an expert right now. This is your first day, it's okay. @13:18 - Lauren Kaminski So just trying to like, you know, and like, you know, with all the curriculum that in my mind, like, we need to get through in sixth grade and like, how that's changed off the years with trying to keep the kids like more invested and like, you know, it's meals. I mean, like, you could spend hours on scales with clarinet, you know, and it's like, the kids don't really, truly care about that anymore, but like, trying to like, have a balance between, you know, hey, I'm teaching you the scales and I'm kind of giving it to you. I did have kids this year that like, went with it, and they like learned stuff on their own, which I haven't had in the last few years, like, they wanted me to see them everything. So, you know, trying to keep the curriculum engaging and you know still getting what I need to get done but also like not pushing scales so much or whatever one part of my curriculum that they're like well I don't this is boring but I can't do this you know the kids that can't cross the break as well I can't you know. @14:17 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Now there's one's upon the time that I would send kids to the office for saying can't like I said it's a cuss word and we're gonna send it and I did that once actually it was the the front office people were in on the gag but we got the point across we we didn't have much of that but at the same time like that's the atrix and that works for a small class of kids that want to be good but how many you know of those classes do we actually have. Ariana or is there anything that you've kind of noticed in your teaching or like barriers to learning or challenges your kids are having and Ariana's gonna walk by the way yeah sorry back country road in Virginia. @14:53 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) We're not that well I mean I'm in a neighborhood. Okay. It was really interesting that she brought up Lauren, that she brought up the perfectionism mixed with the lack of interest and skills, because I will say that I've seen that quite bit over the last couple of years since we came back from COVID. My biggest like hurdle is talking, not me talking, but the students, even though they want to learn everything is still like somehow we've still forgotten to be in a classroom. And we can't get as much done because they just want to talk and then they get mad that they're not as good at something. If you let me finish explaining something so we could do it, then we'd be better at it. So that's really like for somebody who felt like I had pretty good classroom management skills for so long. The last couple of years have really kind of thrown me. And it's not just me like we're seeing it across the school, across the district. from what I've read in a lot of, you know, forums and stuff, it's a relatively common thing since we've come back. But yeah, just trying to get the interest, you know, you sign up for the class, you want to be here. So what is it that you want to do? And some of it's not going to be super fun. I always told my kids, especially at the orchestra, the first year is so boring. Oh my gosh, beginning at orchestra. And, you know, we can hear what band is playing next door and beginning dance is so much more exciting. And they can play full pieces that are like super exciting because everybody writes for the beginning dance. And nobody writes for the beginning orchestra. And I'm like, stick with it. Just trust me that after this year, it's going to be way more fun. And so then we don't, when we do our concerts and they hear seventh and eighth grade, like, oh, but getting them to that point. And even getting my son at the eighth graders to keep pushing through the conversation has just been, it's really thrown. me. And it kind of made me a little scattered and like, kind of keep myself on track when you're talking about curriculum and, you know, balancing the needs of your class was like, I wanted, I want to stay on this topic and get this done, but that's not, you can't always go to that because we've got to focus on the class. That made sense. @17:21 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Oh, totally does. And I mean, I think what both of you have touched on is, I wouldn't take these are new problems, right? These have always been things that kids do and kids struggle with, especially the talking because I'm finding out, um, starts earlier than I thought it did. So the, but like COVID has not been kind to any of this. And even before COVID, kids being raised on screens has not been kind to any of this. One of the things that screens are designed to do is distract like they're meant to engage you, not by getting into like some sort of flow state where like you or one with a machine and whatever is going on, it's much more like you're just constantly distracted being in a casino, basically. A casino of attention is what a lot of people have called it, and that only exacerbates the problems that we're seeing or the challenges we're seeing our kids experience. know, the perfectionism kind of comes from that. Like, if I don't, there's very low cost to quitting things when the next thing is just to swipe away, right? If all you have is like, I hate to sound like my father was like, all I had was a, you know, an old ball to play with. So you figured out things to do with the ball. There is some validity to that, that kids don't experience tension or friction or even just boredom. They are missing some tools, and that could show up really big in the areas where they're learning and trying new things. But then also like the just the attention to task and being on task and understanding how exchange happens in classrooms, especially when there's hormones involved, which, you know, beginners, that's about when that starts to do isn't fun. Didn't we plan that well? The that can be tricky as well. So it's like, to me, I'd plan to talk a lot more about like kind of general ideas about differentiation and stuff like that, but you're raising things that are kind of a little closer to stuff I've been thinking about. So with your permission, mean, we could just explore these as kind of the the test bed for the stuff we're talking about. And like the biggest thing, I think that comes to mind on things we're talking about quote unquote are, you know, when we're looking for the kid to do xyz, what is the thing we're looking for and how well defined is it in our brain? You know, whether that is an actual like definition like a rubric or how well formed is the target. behavior in our brain in terms of I could describe the qualities of it and I could also show you how far away you are from whatever it is that I'm evaluating you against. Like when we think about that in a musical sense we probably have a pretty good repertoire of things to pull from. But are those things we're pulling from always where the kids need them to be, right? In the sense that we have these kind of plans of action for like how to play this note better on an instrument. But if the kids are swirly or kind of everywhere where they crumble, like I always call them like paper children, they just kind of burst into flames when anything goes wrong. You know those kind of mechanisms we use to teach stuff like do these steps or do this thing or you know A to B to C to D might not work. And so it's adapting the outcomes we're looking for to not just the tools we have. The tools are probably pretty good. But how the students work themselves into the tools is kind of, I think, the missing piece that is something that we can spend some time talking about. And so let's go back to your example, Lauren, of kids just kind of crumbling when something goes wrong. normally the kids in that bottom third in terms of their skill acquisition. And there's already things acting on them that make that kind of heightened, maybe too, depending on the kid. And so, like, I guess my question is, like, what are some of the skills you're seeing them kind of hit as a wall? Is it like really, really routine basic stuff? Or is it more advanced skills or the combining stuff? where do you kind of see that wall happen if you see it happen in one place? @21:49 - Lauren Kaminski You know, I feel like it depends on the day. Like, for some kids, sometimes it's like they might just be having a bad day. And so they come in and it's like, okay, like I'm just. It's gonna, you know, let him be, you know, but I would say probably, I feel like, kind of in the beginning, I feel like everyone, you know, kind of gets the first skills that we're doing. It's probably once we start kind of, you know, spring semester when we're doing harder skill sets, but that's when stuff happens or, you know, I had a few kids like break down around the winter music when we were preparing that for the concert. So I would kind of say, you know, I guess higher level skills and like around the winter concert for some kids. @22:38 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So, and like if, if memory serves, because it's been a while since I've done a beginner here, so like that also is for you, does that involve the entire ensemble playing together for the first time? @22:51 - Lauren Kaminski Or do they still do lines out of the book? We do. Each class does a song. Their own song and then we have a unison line that the whole band does. together, and then we do one piece that has like two different parts going on. And I mean, like I have two different clarinet parts. So I'm like teaching clarinet parts for the first time and kind of explaining what first part is and second part is and that kind of thing. @23:16 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay. And I mean, that's, you know, for beginners, that's challenging. part of me has to wonder kind of getting back to the perfectionism, the kind of fragile child, paper children's syndrome. How much or is any of the challenges you're experienced exacerbated by the social dimension that's kind of rushing in, right? You're kind of in your little bubble of the flute class with clarinet class or whatever it is. And then you kind of, you know, lack of a better term, stir up the bowl of skittles and you see everything all mixed together and some kids, that is hugely destabilizing. Even kids that aren't diagnosed as being on the spectrum tend to function that way a little bit more because because they don't have the same social cues. didn't grow up with them the same way, and there's little bubble of them that's kind of floating through the educational system. what you're describing, we're gonna see in about six years, and with some modifications, maybe. So I mean, I wonder, is that playing into it at all, or do you think it's removed enough from that, that it's not a direct link? @24:23 - Lauren Kaminski I don't know, you know, I know like one kid that he like threw a fit one day with our class song, and the next day he came back, we had a test later on that week, and he played it, and he played it, and I looked at him, and I was like, you got an A, that was amazing, what'd you do? I went home and practiced, okay, so you throw on a fit the other day that you couldn't get it, it's just because you hadn't done your stuff at home. So, you know, and I think we do, so like our classes all meet at the same time, so we have three beginner classes going, and so like we'll come find them, especially for the winter stuff, it gets closer, so like, hey, this is kind of what you can see, you know? And so they get to kind of be with their friends and everything. But I don't know, I just think, you know, kids learn at different rates. I know I look like math, I wasn't good at math, and I always laughed because we did some like smart math thing in high school. And it was like, we started at late, so we were doing skills that we had already learned, and then we were doing other stuff. And so I was like finally getting good with smart math on the skills that we had already been tested over. So I know, like, kids do hit stuff. It's just a matter of like, what can I do to like help keep them thinking, keep them in line, and like, just not giving up on themselves learning wise, and the pace of the class going, and not letting the class stall out, while they try to like, figure stuff out. @25:56 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, and since you guys are spread so thin with having three simultaneous. these classes and three directors, right? like, that's not good. You can't be like, Oh, somebody coming to do this thing. You know, I have to wonder, especially because practice at home kind of becomes the thing of like, that, you know, see, that works, but they have to kind of find it on their own. They can't be told anything because heaven, defend that someone knows something they don't. But is there a way to do something worth like, that not working? Okay. And like, have a thing that they do, whether it's like shadow play or whatever, like give them a routine, you should move on to the next person, but give them like a set of behaviors to do that also reinforces what it's like to break down a problem, like the thing we teach them to do when, you know, before they take their instrument homes, like, here's kind of how you think through something that doesn't work, how to make it work better. And so maybe something along those lines might be helpful, because then that also, like, like, to me, practice time is @27:00 - Lauren Kaminski like work if you make it that way and that like it was something I have to do it's like this thing I have to check off rather than like I have this thing that's not working I'm going to go spend some time on it like we want the kids to get to that place but they've got to see the payoff and this cohort is really payoff averse in terms of like if it's not there right away it's the end of the world and I will say sometimes you know kids will help each other so it's like if they can tell I'll move on and they're co-person you know because I mix up the kids I somewhat sat them in share order and then I kind of mix kids around that could help other kids and so I would move on and they would the kid next to me be like hey it's you know you got to do and so they would kind of step in also but sometimes I mean kids would not accept it's like they're just trying to help you like I had a kid get upset one time that a friend was trying to help them but for the most part like kids are very accepting of like each other trying to help them and I'm like fine with that. I'm like, maybe they can say it better than I'm saying it, you know, or they can clarify. so if I see a kid, you know, reaching over and helping or, you know, the kid knows like, hey, this person's better than me, I'll move on and they're like, hey, can you show me X, Y, or Z? @28:17 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Well, I think that plays into also this idea. And we've talked about this before in this course of like bands and really all the ensemble traditions, but band orchestras, choirs are the big ones in the US that are these like organisms that don't exist in other ways, other places. So if you think about the music of, you know, pick any country where it's like, oh, the music of this thing that's not like what we have in the West, most of their ensembles are not 50, 60 people minimum, right? They're, they're, you know, a collection of eight to 12 people, kind of what we would call chamber group size. We have to, as band directors and orchestra directors and bar directors think about the social structure and the social dimension of what we're doing and having kids have the skills to accept that help and to go, okay, this person is not criticizing me. I remember Mr. you know, you always say like first thing is like, I give you feedback. It's information. It's not criticism. It's never about you. It's about what you're doing. He was always really kind of overly pointed about that. But at the same time, kids need that clear boundary too, because a lot of them do not pick up on subtlety anymore. sarcasm is really hard to come back as sarcasm lives on subtlety. And it's just not landing with the children these days, for whatever reason. And so, you know, like, to me, that might be something to explore of maybe on the first day, you know, this is something we do in our vamper and we help each other. And if you're not okay with that, here's what you say and you just have some sort of like, you know, it's like putting the red card up at a child, like, don't give me any more food. But for the rest of the kids, it's almost like, I'm actually listening to podcast about Richard Thaler, who won the Nobel Prize for creating behavioral economics, and they talk about how when you have a default choice that ups you into something, like over 90% of people just leave it, they don't question, I'm sure whatever that's fine, and maybe treating something like, because it sounds like the kind they feel like they have to get it with you, or all those lost, and so they don't have any other tools to lean back off that creates this kind of, for some of them, really panicky, heightened sense of, ooh, I'm not good enough, which heaven knows they already do anyways, we don't need to help that, it's already there. And so maybe even something to be like, you know, we help each other in this band program, and here's what it looks like, here's how you don't want it, here's what you say, if you do want it, you just let the other person start talking, and they know we do. you get to set the rules for what helping looks like. we use the same words we use in class, but we might explain them a little bit differently. It might even just be like that kid needs five reps and you have time for two to that day. You know, like, because I remember observing student teacher in your class, and like you had 20 some odd, like it was a big flute class, which is great that's what you want, but like there's one of you and you kind of are limited, but the size program you have and the way your structure is set up, like you've got to adapt to that, but if the kids aren't getting it, we have to find other ways. So building that sort of autonomy and I'm okay, if you don't get it with me, turn to your person next to you when you guys can workshop it together or whatever that looks like, however you want to have that to be set up. That might be an option because what you're doing there is you're differentiating the task by extending the time the student gets suspended, like it's classic, you know, one of the accommodations you'd put on an IEP that also who doesn't belabor the fact that we are usually one to 60 or one to 25 or one to whatever big ratio in our classroom. so like additional time doesn't always scale to what we need to get done. So that might be something to think about. And I think the other thing too, and this is something we all struggle with as teachers, is defining what the minimum, like what is the thing that we're going to go, okay, that's good for today. It's really hard for some kids to know what that is because in their brain, for whatever reason, if it's not perfect, then it's not good enough. Like they have a binary relationship with things. And so for us as teachers and as musicians to define, okay, here are the things we're going to use to describe what I want you to do. Here's what it sounds like when I demonstrate it, or it sounds like when someone else in the class demonstrates it. But here's other areas that are going to be good enough. Like sometimes kids need that. And it might not take more than two or three times to do something along the lines of that. So they start building this image of like, oh, there's a range of what's acceptable. There's a, it's not a, you know, bull's eye or nothing. Like, and we know, like, if they hold the sound still on that first day, we're really happy. Like, you're doing great, kid. But some of the kids are so scared. And we see this with the undergrads, too. Like, they are terrified to say something wrong, which that's been around forever. Like, I felt that way in music school. know you both did a high cost of being wrong in the school of music. But these kids are almost paralyzed by it. Because even more, even once it's clear that there are no stakes for saying something wrong and sense of like, you're going to be made fun of, they still do not want to put their money out there. They're really reticent to kind of bite at things. And then once they do, they do what you'd expect them to do. get really into it. It's great. but needing them to make that decision is hard. like you said, it's about making things sticky. Oh, there I am, must be home now. It's also about making things sticky in the sense of, we want the, I always tell the undergrads, like you're going remember about 10% of the things we do in this class. It's one of them to make sure that 10% you remember is the stuff that helps you the best. And so finding a way to make the things that really need to be sticky stick. So, you know, like you said, the basic fundamentals of things, kids tend to pick up really well and it's getting them to be comfortable with kind of putting things together, you know, like the two-headed monster on Sesame Street. Like these two skills that they do is together and becomes a new thing. And that also might be another place where letting them kind of have the freedom to spin out a little bit, not literally, figuratively, work with their person, can't beat you in the next round. And then you're going to have a couple kids make up. Like, you can play that however you work for your flow in your classroom. But I think giving them that autonomy, but then also showing them, you know, here's what it sounds like at the beginning, and it's kind of like at the end, and that's not all about just being here, it's about the growth to get there, and all the things we tell them to keep them engaged, because you know, those bottom kids, I don't know about you, but I was one of those bottom kids once, like, I wasn't always in the wind ensemble, especially when I switched instruments, I used to put trumpet, and then I figured, no, I'm not going to get a high enough chair doing that, so I switched to French horn, because that's what you could do in Pennsylvania at that time, because there was no competition for things like that, but you know, like these kids also deserve a visual experience, and so most of time it boils down to the quantity of time we don't have, and the way that we're spread so thin in our classroom, especially with beginners. You know the classroom control thing too is Like we have to we have to find her comfortable about that like we're taught really early on that the best classrooms are silent Right like if you're focused and they're studying and they're doing all the things I mean maybe sometimes that happens, but usually in the classrooms that I've felt like I've learned the most It's only like that sometimes. It's only like that when someone is talking You know like when everyone's listening while everyone's talking and then once that person's done talking There's a thing that happens whether it's we talk about their cells questions, it is Those tend to be the classrooms the interactive classrooms tend to be the ones that are More conducive to learning, but that's harder to do with big groups with middle schoolers Especially with beginner instrumentalists. It's like hurting cats that are on catnip so You know the the question there is you know, we're not even getting far enough into the higher or even needs to start talking about like transformational stuff. We're talking about like keeping the lights on and keeping shelter over our head, that these kids can't get passed, like just how to be in society. And so, you know, like where's the failing? I don't think there's anyone thinking we can point to, but what can we do to augment it? And so, you know, for that, if you tried going way back to basics and having them stand in hallway, Ariana, like right shoulder to the wall and quiet and all the things. @37:30 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) Oh yeah, like we've spent over half a class period at a time doing that. We've repeated it, you know, every other day since I don't see them every day, got over an emailed home reminder of things like it's all, I didn't sign up for the, I didn't look at it yet, but this got laying the backpack that he sent out this year, which is supposed to be like a last room agreement. type thing that you set up with your classes and so I was just curious and I was like let me sign up for it and see what it looks like in all of my free time which I clearly have since I'm doing my two mile walks at nine o'clock at night you know I have not looked at it yet so I'm curious just because maybe that's the thing that gets these kids this year I don't know as far as instructionally aside from talking if I can shift just slightly my biggest instructional issue outside of the talking has been transferring of skills like okay like I have had to because I had to pick up violin so quickly because I had no idea what I was doing I've even noticed this oftentimes I'll read in intervals instead of actually paying attention to the notes that are happening because I don't have time to think about what's happening as I'm trying to keep up with my eighth graders who are obviously playing more than I am at at their level because they get to spend more time teaching them music than playing it with them. But the transference of like, okay, you're going to play open one, two, and then guess what we're going to do on the next string? Open one, two, three, and everything goes up one letter in the alphabet. one or open one, three, four, unless it's base, in which case bases have to shift just to play one scale. It's a lot for them. But like, my students have not been able to, sorry, my husband just needs to bless you. I've not been able to transfer the idea of literally it's the exact same finger pattern on all four strings. All four, one letter at a time. Like, for some reason, especially this past year, like it never clicked, never. And I thought of every possible way that I could come up with to explain it. And I feel like I failed miserably. mean, we got through music by then, you know, when it was all said and done. But now I'm like, okay, how do we avoid that coming year? And it's to the point that I've actually thought about going slightly Suzuki and having them play notes before they see them on a staff. Not too far. Like I don't want them learning full pieces of music and then throwing, you know, at them. But like, okay, let's learn how to play Open D. Okay, here's what you just played and this is what it looks like. Because I thought maybe with this group, it was just too much information at once. I don't know. I can't, it can't hurt anything to try it that way. If I quickly see that it's not working, then we just shift gears and go back to, you know, Plan A. But that transference of knowledge, which I always felt like I was very good about stacking suddenly felt like I didn't know what I was doing at all because it just wasn't, it didn't click this year. And I think probably talking was a part of that where there was was never enough focused to just, oh, I'm doing the same thing over and over again. It just, there was never enough attention. I mean, I don't know, I grew up in a program that is like, I don't know about now, but at the time, hadn't gotten anything less than a superior and over 20 something years. didn't talk. Failure was not an option. It was, so that was what I was so used to. And I don't regret that. actually quite enjoyed it. It made me very competitive. I think it turned me into the better. I mean, I saw the kids when that, because they laugh, because I'll sing along to like essential elements, lines as band plays next door. And they're like, how do you know this? I'm like, well, know, back in the 1900s, when their music was on a cassette tape, I would rewind the track and I would practice for an hour. they're like, what is rewind me? What's like a sat tape? you practice for an hour. or I don't take my instrument home. like, there's that huge disconnect because obviously the teachers are the ones who we are those nerds who took our instruments home and worked all the time. And so trying to be like, okay, you didn't practice at home. Let's give you some time here. But also we do need to push forward and figuring out what didn't work last year and how to make it work this year. @42:27 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, I think the thing that stands out to me the most, there is, you know, transfer of learning is something that kind of is a course to water for a situation, right? Like you can't make, you can make them to a certain point, but then they have to be like, oh yeah, thing. Like I know the way I learned how to teach going over the break and not make it something scary was flip their instrument around. So I'm holding it in their mouth and I control everything. so they do the same error, do the exact same thing. And, you know, we do... Really basic limited stuff, but to show them like going to the break, you don't change anything. It's just your fingers and That kind of narrow the the attention of like things that are scary about this this Right, but that was just an demonstration in front of the kids like for whatever reason that stuck And I think you're doing the right thing around and like going I'm gonna try this one thing this year I'm gonna try this one try the contract within this year But I guess then then my question is like what is living kind of before that in in this chain of dominoes Like what is the thing that's typically the domino that makes you have to go get a behavioral contract? What are they coming in with something? Are they is it truly just to change in the students? Sorry everything just went to nighttime mode, so it's literally a little bit You know like Is there a change in the school culture if they're just a change in the way kids are like and this is where we all kind of Guard ourselves against sounding like our parents, but at the same time super generations of different personalities. So, where do you think your specific issue kind of lives maybe? @44:07 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) I mean, we are about to have our fourth superintendent in my 10 years here. We are on our third principle, not counting acting principles in the interim in my 10 years here. This past year so there was a big shift. doesn't explain sixth graders coming in necessarily because it didn't matter if he was new or not. Everybody, anybody would have been new to him. But a school culture shift and how we address, we have extremely high teacher turnover. This year I think we only lost, I'm probably going to get a from the other room in a minute, but I think only like 10 to 15. We usually it's closer to 30, and they're almost always brand new teachers, so the school culture alone is harder to address in one classroom when everybody's new and everybody's hair is on fire all the time, you know. Even if I might have my rules, they may or may not be the same as another teacher who has done this forever, who has never done this before, or isn't licensed to teach and has never been in school since they got out of school, you know, so it's a very I don't want to say it's a difficult school, it's not that, it's just that it's a difficult environment sometimes because it's changing constantly, there's a lack of consistency, so I think that's felt across the student body, whether they realize it or not, like obviously like I said the sixth graders won't feel that, it's just somewhere new for them. do feel like mature 30 levels are different. We're seeing this weird thing with technology, and I've told my kids before, like, it used to be like, when I got the internet, you know, way back when it was dialups, that if you wouldn't say something to somebody's face, you wouldn't say it online because it was mean, and now the kids are growing up saying mean things online first, and so they have no problem saying those things to people's faces because all the US trash talk each other online with their access to games and things like that, and so we're seeing some of that, and I was going somewhere else with that and I don't remember where. What was it? I don't know, but just the maturity. So we have this weird thing where they're exposed to things that they probably shouldn't be exposed to at younger ages, so in some ways like they're not necessarily more mature, but they've been around more mature things. But like Laura was saying, I have more kids that whose hands need to be held figuratively. They really are so scared of doing it wrong, or they've never had to problem-solve themselves. They need somebody to tell them every single step of the way, my kids just turn six, but when they're like three and four, I'm like, figure it out. don't solve the world's problems, but there's an issue in front of you that you're capable of solving what's solved it, and I always tell them, know, I'm giving you the tools you need to be successful. It's up to you to use them. And then kind of like you were saying with Mr. Green, like I always tell kids, like, it's not personal. I promise you, you'll know if it's personal, but I'm addressing something. It's just because it's something that needs to be fixed. It doesn't mean you're horrible. It doesn't mean you're a bad player or a bad person. Just means you did something wrong. got to address and we move on, and it's no big deal. And some kids take that very internal. and I'm like, I, as somebody who internalizes everything, I wouldn't do that to you. Like, because I understand what that would feel like. But yeah, just kind of feeling that, I think that is also part of that level of immaturity that we're seeing is that they don't know how to handle when we address them. They don't get that it's for the greater good, not because they're bad at something. It doesn't mean they're bad. It's just that your finger is low too. It's like, you know, mean going around with the trombones and it Pam, Pam Beasley from the office and it's like, second position, third position, what's the difference? They're the same thing, know, for my kids, it's low too. I, at our spring concert, I'm like, well, too, well, too to one of my violins this year, because she, you're playing regular too, but I'm like, it's like, try not to be loud enough for the audience to hear it. Right. Right, exactly. So just those There's little things without them taking it personally, but also just getting through it and applying it. @49:09 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, and I mean that's something where we maybe have to kind of help them and be much more maybe structured than we might otherwise want to be because like you pointed out Lauren, like some of these kids need to be handheld all the way through and maybe some of them don't come from homes where they have to think on their own, you know, like we've all come across the helicopter parent or the lawnmower parent or the bulldozer parent or whatever piece of construction equipment that we're talking about the parents operating to defend their child from all adversity. So we know what that's like, but you know, we also know we have to find a way ideally to integrate those kids into a group that is probably cut from different kids than them. And so a lot of times it's, you know, what's the pathway to this thing I need to do and there's actually some really interesting book you might have come across, some of them might not have come across others. There's three that have really stood out to me in recent kind of coinage, because there's a lot of these out here that are interesting but not actually helpful, and these kind of hit both targets of being interesting and helpful. The first one is this guy named Josh Weitzken, who if you've seen the movie Finding Bobby Fisher, like it's about this kid, like he was Trust Grandmaster at H14, like one of those mostly talented kids, and he wrote a book all about the way he learned, and you kind of have to grit your teeth, because he's very, it reads like maybe some other Silicon Valley people might read, that sort of, I am the god among men from Etheostown from the Mountain sort of thing, so you have to get past that, but he does a lot where he talks about this is one of the things I think that was really well for us as musicians of space repetition, like we're going to do this thing at this interval between and we do stuff in between, but then also this idea of incremental learning and breaking it down into the smallest piece. And like one of the things that I've pulled from that and I've tried to apply is how do we give the kids the tools to break down the thing that's challenging them into something they can't accomplish, and then something else they can accomplish, then they chain those things together into the third thing. And however many steps it takes, because we don't have the time to do that for them. wish we could in the best of all possible worlds we can, but that's not where we live. And so, you know, books like that, it's called The Art of Learning, and I'll send a summary over to you in the morning. It is, again, you have to kind of get around the tone that he writes with, but he does point some things out. And a lot of it is stuff that we as teachers can do more to install into our programs. And this is what I mean by that. We have a collection of kids in front of us at any given time, any ensemble, any class that can do things independent of us, and it's pretty rare that we take advantage of that in a meaningful way. When they play, they're doing stuff on their own, but that's kind of in coordination with us. We kind of are holding their hands in some ways there. But do we have any place for them to not be off the rails, but to have some autonomy, to have some areas to explore in so that we can teach them steps, like how to break this down into this thing, how to break this down into this thing without me being there. So what's the thing that's challenging you? I can't do that thing. Okay, what are the things we need to do to do that? for you, especially for you, Ariana, this actually might help you in becoming more familiar with kind of the extended parts of the instruments that you would, you know, if you're going to talk them through like a checklist almost. There's another great book. don't have a sorry this ready, but I can get it ready. Call the checklist manifestos by a doctor named Atul Gawande. Okay. Um, he's a, I think he was an ER doctor. could be wrong about that. What he found though was all of these surgical mistakes were coming about because everybody thought somebody else had done it. So they created basically a checklist to do these things where this person is going to walk out with gods in their body. So the stakes are a lot higher, but the idea of a kid being able to create like, okay, what are the things I'm doing to make this thing happen? Whatever it is, going, you know, doing a shift, whether it's playing an octave slur on flute, whether it's, you know, the chromatic scale that makes everyone cry on clarinet. You know, whatever it is, how, how can they focus down to the thing that is going to, once they fix it, be the news of difference. And I think empowering kids to have that is something that doesn't happen overnight. But if we have it as a goal, we start to develop kids that are helpful. one to themselves, but also other people, it can be more that when we help each other, this is what we fill it with. We were talking about that earlier, Lauren. But the other thing is that they are going to be assets to the group as well because they are not going to, unless it's really severe, add problems to the list of things. They're going to try and fix their own problems first. part of that is motivation. like you said, it's hard to get these kids excited about stuff because there's all this other noise happening in their lives. And the thing that kept on coming to mind there, and this doesn't apply equally in both situations at all, but this kind of idea that things outside of the room are in, outside of the orchestra, outside of band hall are chaos at any given time. They're just nuts. some time with hallways, you'll hear it. Come into our room, very ordered, where we have our things, we but then how much of that can we spin? and got a lot of energy into like, is it Miss Penny, whatever her name is in Matilda, the movie, the rolled doll movie, Miss Honey? Yeah, her. Yes. That like, not Miss Frizzle, what we can do Miss Frizzle little too easily. But Miss Honey, where it's like you are the the reason part of the reason why the kids come to your room is because it is that place where they feel safe and all these things. And I think we kind of get the safe space and all like the kind of leftist language kind of frets that down and makes it sound unappealing. But at the end of the day, how much can we project that to the kids? By the way, we teach them how to handle problems, right? The biggest problem with chaos is you don't know how to enter it to make anything make sense. But we'll teach you a way here to take the thing that's not making sense and at least find one step you can take to making it better and then take another step and another step. And that's hard. Like, I don't have an answer for what that looks like specifically. to each of us. But I think if we turn our attention to it, it'll ordeal itself. Because it's going to be built on the things you already know how to do well and feel comfortable getting kids to do. It's just a matter of getting them to use those same tools, and then check back in with you. Because that's the other thing you do is you introduce variability into what they decide to do with the thing. And so that's a question of training. Like when we start them off, when we have the conversation, same conversation maybe as we help each other in here is, here are the things we think are the most important. Our sound stays still, our sound is good, or whatever, however that lives. We work together, we never worked against each other, whatever that is. Because a lot of this I think is coming down to not the content we have, but how the kids connect and get into the content. Like what's their entry point? And I think you both identified that the entry point is, if not completely different, at least different enough that it doesn't. and map to what we've done before. And you're both a good enough teacher if you're finding your feet, in terms of making something work to make the thing happen using the old content and maybe a new way of approaching it. But I guess my question is, how can we take the content without changing it, without watering it down? you talked about Lauren, like nobody wants to do scales anymore. True, I I'm not sure they ever want to do scales. think we did them because we had to. But, and not even like, how can we make it fun and gamify? think that's gonna, you're gonna see a lot of technology solutions that are gonna do things like that for the reason you're pointing out. It's, you know, kids are just wondering. But how can we take the actual ideas themselves? Whether they're note names, whether they're, you know, pitch organizations, whether they're more higher-end things like style and articulation and make them stickier. So we don't have to basically re-teach them. over and over again. They stick and we can build on them. And one of the things is another book that you're going get a summary of is called Make It Stick. Can we either of you come across that before? It's actually really interesting book in the education space that talks about literally how people learn and one of the things it brings up to, similar to the first one we talk about, it's a space repetition of like we do it here and then we're going to wait little while and we do it here and we do it really intensely in those two spots, but we don't touch it in between which like for us as teachers scares us and it's probably not something you're going to apply to everything, but in both of these books explore what's kind of the boundary of things that are affected by this and where just the complexity of the task is too much, it doesn't work. So the other thing there too though is this idea of effortful learning like that you have to put some skin in the game, you have to try this thing and you know the other thing that I worked on kind of later in my career was this idea of you know if you don't think it's going to work but I'm asking you to do do it. I want you to at least try it. Just like when you're a little kid, you got some, you know, whatever the thing is, you don't want to eat. You just have to try a little bit of it. And if you do, fine. Because nine times out of ten, the thing that I wanted them to do, they didn't want to do, works. So it's more to get them over that. But then finding those levers with kids, I think, is a really important thing that they have to put some effort into it, but that the effort is returned by the positive reward. Now, part of that is where we set the reward. Is the reward playing the time of your scale? Or in the case of kids learning, you know, open one, one, three, four, whatever it is, that you can go, okay, next one's going to start on the G string. And like, hopefully it's not G string. But the, like, they have to jump and do the thing. And that's the reward there. It's not that they're learning it's transferable. that, oh, did that thing, and I did it fast and I did it faster than the next person, whatever it is. And so all of a sudden, then you can start to refine things, okay? Hey, now, it's not just who's fastest, who sounds the best, like you can start playing that game. And so it's a matter of, again, meeting them where they are, but not with the content. It's the pathway you create to the content. And heaven knows TikTok is not going to do us any favors in letting kids have longer attention spans moving forward. Like that's just not what happened, I don't think. And so it's up to us to find ways around that. And one of the ways we know is to return dopamine really, really quickly to get a kid hooked. It's the same thing as the candy does, same things that cigarettes do. It gets that dopamine loop happening. all of a sudden the kid is in it to win it. So it's finding those. And actually a third book and then a lead to be to consider picking up. this, if you don't buy any of the books, this I think is the best one to buy for what we do. It's called intelligent music teaching by a guy named Bob Duke. He is music at University of Texas. And well, music and human wondering is what they call it. They're because they want to be very specific. It's true. That's what they study and do a very good job of it. It has a lot of things in there that I think help clarify teaching. In fact, if I would never do it because it's his book, but I would love to teach a course just of this book for a summer thing, where it's kind of a pick up session, because it's these little essays. They're, I think, the longest is maybe 20 pages. it's all these different aspects of learning and how we learn the music and the things we assume are happening that maybe actually aren't happening in ways that we can think differently to be closer to what the kids are actually doing, but also kind of spin their effort back on itself to kind of build them into a little dynamo much faster. you want to think of it that way, it's a great book. It's pretty inexpensive. I think it's like maybe 18 bucks on Amazon and it's thin. It's very slender. It's just a little wisp of a book. But in terms of thinking about how students learn, I think that's a really great book to check out. I'll send you the outline where we talked through today, but all. So the summary and the transcript and book recommendations in the video tomorrow in the morning. Thank you guys for being here. It was good to see both of you. I'm glad you didn't get hit by a car this time, Ariana. ACTION ITEM: Send Lauren and Ariana summary and transcript of call, links to recommended books (The Art of Learning, Checklist Manifesto, Intelligent Music Teaching), and video recording - WATCH Not that you did last time, but there was concern and Lauren was good seeing you. @1:02:18 - Lauren Kaminski Yes, same. I was going to say about the candy and stuff. We started doing tetric boards before Christmas. And so I told the kids, I was like, all right, to earn a sticker, it's this tempo. If you want candy to try to like encourage more dexterity and fingers quicker, like it's this tempo. I mean, kids wanted that candy. mean, once the very first time we did like, no one really wanted to volunteer. So I kind of pushed on the kids that I knew would be successful and made them fall and told them. But it kind of like, you know, once the kids kind of saw like some success from other kids, like, I mean, they would come in, are we going to do tetra cords today? Are we going to get to, you know, It was just so funny that it's like candy tempo or a sticker tempo. Oh, tempo. @1:03:04 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You know, it's just amazing. @1:03:06 - Lauren Kaminski Candy does. @1:03:07 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Mm hmm. I mean, and that's the thing though, like, we're finding that even though these kids present very weirdly, they are the same kids we talked before. There's just a different pathway to get to what you've discovered. like the place where they get they do the thing that all kids do and they light up like a light bulb. Yeah. @1:03:23 - Lauren Kaminski ice cream sandwiches when we got when we got into scales, it was like, okay, with multiple octaves. So it was like, all right, if you get your region eight, and for the planets, I made it a six to make them feel a little more successful because their skills are harder. But I'm like, you get a star and an ice cream sandwich, and then you get your other scale sheet. And so then you can earn something else. And so that was my mildly successful, like I had planets that like, you know, wanted that ice cream sandwich. And so they got their six and then they finished, I helped them finish off their others. But it's just kind of, I'm like, always like, okay, what can like kind of put them in want to. And I, you know, I did videos for flutes and the other woodwind stuff I teach, I don't really do the videos, but with clarinets, there's so much specific like things, greens. I did videos and I posted them into our Schoology. And so some kids like, Hey, you can go rewatch this. Like we did it in class today. But guess what? talked about it and explain it in this video. So some kids would go and rewatch the video and some that would struggle in class. It's like, well, did you watch my video? Well, no, I guess I can. like, well, it's going to go step by step for you at home. It's like having me at your house trying to get them even just like use the Schoology videos. Like I made these videos. You know, I wish I don't think they got used as much. I know some students use them, but more kids would like buy into like, Hey, it's okay if I, you know, go home and figure this out or go home and she went over this in class. @1:04:56 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I didn't get it. And now it's in a literally a video. @1:05:00 - Lauren Kaminski I'm always like, how can I you know help and kind of like you said buy them in like get them get them in Yeah, and I mean that's amazing that you've done even not even what you've done. @1:05:12 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You've done like that is a lot of It's captured a couple kids along the way. I'm guessing It's like I think the other thing maybe that that we as teachers kind of need to wrap our branch around It's it's not pleasant is that these kids are like whereas before they were like maybe three or four things Everybody's into now. They're like thousands like they're into a little bit of everything It's what some theres called the long tail of the internet where like you can do with a thousand other people that like that very specific thing because the internet connects you from all over the world and so You know that we don't have those same pressures and things to pull on so I think anything you can do to Kind of help them is good But it might need to be a bunch of different things to capture a bunch of different kids You have in their classroom and so like this idea that we all have as teachers of the silver bullet that solves all the problems was never a reality before, but sometimes it worked. I think it's less than less effective now, and I think you touched on it really well, Lauren, with like having to do a bunch of different things to capture kind of enough kid that you see the progress you want to have. And I think that's, and if we're thinking about student learning, the first thing that is vital and central there is thinking about student learning. Like what are they doing, and how are they doing, and how can we, and you both do this, connect what they are doing with the steps they need to do, the thing we want them to accomplish. And sometimes it's a really easy transfer, sometimes it is a much further transfer, and so we need to kind of build back. But you know, the fact that one of the things that came up is this idea of community, this thing of culture, or this thing of, you know, help each other, like that starts to get into kind of the social emotional stuff too, which I know is, you know, anathema in some conversations, but at the same time, it's always been part of how we teach music and arts. so I think that's something to consider, too, that both of you from where you're talking sound like is installed in your thinking, always using everything as an opportunity to build on both at the same time. So where you're building community, it also helps the skill achievement or that sort of thing. Big brothers, big sisters, big buddies, whatever term you want to use for that might be a way to kind of want to extend your reach, or given that you're one person of how many, but two, allow you to kind of give those eighth graders that are chopping at the bit, something that is, there's consistently, it's not a special thing, so they can act like a twerp. They'll get out of the act feeling a twerp phase and get into actually being humans about it if you give them enough time. And so I think the stuff you both said you do is exactly what you need to do, but I don't need to do that because this stuff you do works. But at the end of the day, I think these three books are kind of good things to have in the back of your brain. But the thinking about it's not the content necessarily, the content is good, content works. know, the content has stood the test of time in a lot of ways to achieve the ends it wants to achieve. But are we then our job then becomes how do we connect the kids experience what they naturally gravitate towards and how they navigate the world with the stuff we want them to do. And those connection points kind of got fried during COVID in a lot of ways in ways that we're learning every year. So I don't envy you that. We're dealing with, you know, a lesser version of it just with way better hiding skills in the college. But at least you can identify what it is. And that gives you a much better chance of hitting the target now that you've figured out what it isn't. It's not the content. It's not your teaching. It's connecting the kids with the stuff you bring. And that's not easy. And hopefully these books, these outlines of this stuff will be a place for you to build a couple of ideas that work this year. @1:09:06 - Lauren Kaminski Yeah. Thanks. @1:09:08 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) It was very interesting. @1:09:10 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) The time went by fast. Cool. I'm happy to be a lovely waste of time. I will see. @1:09:17 - Lauren Kaminski I'm like, my brain's already kind of like turning. So it's kind of, you know, just a different way of thinking about next year. @1:09:24 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Good. Yeah. mean, that's really what this is supposed to be. @1:09:27 - Lauren Kaminski a way for us like it's yoga for your brain. @1:09:29 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah. don't have to think about me doing yoga. @1:09:33 - Lauren Kaminski would not be successful.

Key approaches include creating a supportive classroom environment where mistakes are normalized, using incremental learning steps, and providing focused practice opportunities. Allowing students autonomy in problem-solving and using varied incentives to increase motivation were also highlighted. Connecting musical content to students' lived experiences makes learning more accessible and engaging. Recommended resources for further insights included \"The Art of Learning,\" \"Make It Stick,\" and \"Intelligent Music Teaching.\" VIEW RECORDING - 70 mins (No highlights) Key Takeaways * Beginner music students often struggle with frustration, perfectionism, lack of focus, and difficulty transferring skills when learning new concepts and techniques. This can lead to shutting down or giving up easily. * Building a supportive classroom community where mistakes are normalized and students feel safe taking risks is crucial for their learning process. Peer support systems can be valuable. * Breaking down complex skills into incremental steps, providing focused practice opportunities, and celebrating small successes help students progress without getting overwhelmed. * Giving students some autonomy to problem-solve challenges independently or in pairs before intervening as the teacher can build their confidence and skills. * Using varied incentives and rewards that motivate students increases their engagement with effortful practice and learning. * Connecting the musical content meaningfully to students' lived experiences, interests, and existing skills makes it more accessible and \"sticky\" for retention. Topics Discussed Challenges Faced by Beginner Music Students The participants shared the common challenges their beginner students face in learning music: * Frustration and shutting down when unable to immediately grasp a new skill * Perfectionist mindsets - if they can't do it perfectly, they get discouraged * Lack of focused attention and excessive talking in class * Difficulty transferring skills across contexts (e.g. across strings on instruments) * Immaturity in independent problem-solving, expecting constant hand-holding * Struggles with combining or building on previously learned skills These challenges are likely exacerbated by factors like high teacher/school turnover disrupting consistent culture, student exposure to more mature content through technology, and changing student mindsets in the post-COVID world. Effective Strategies to Support Student Learning The educators discussed several promising strategies to facilitate beginner student learning: * Fostering a supportive classroom community where mistakes are normalized * Explicitly teaching routines for peer support and collaborative problem-solving * Breaking down complex tasks into incremental steps for scaffolded learning * Using varied incentives like food, rewards, and games to increase motivation * Allowing students autonomy to try solving challenges before intervening * Making musical concepts \"stickier\" through repetitive practice over time * Connecting abstract concepts to concrete skills/experiences students already have * Meeting students \"where they are\" by understanding their specific entry points * Framing the classroom as a safe space amidst external chaos Recommended Resources Cory recommended three books that provide research-based insights into how students learn: 1. \"The Art of Learning\" by Josh Waitzkin - Discusses strategies like spaced repetition and incremental learning 2. \"Make It Stick\" - Explores principles like effortful learning for retention 3. \"Intelligent Music Teaching\" by Robert Duke - Applies cognitive research to music learning specifically The key is understanding it's not necessarily the musical content that needs changing but developing effective pathways to make it engaging and accessible for today's students. Transcript @7:08 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay so speaking of doing things today we're gonna talk about this idea of student learning and kind of all the different ways it lives but talk about it from a perspective that recognizes what we bring as teachers and what our experience brings but also who kind of points our attention to other ways to consider learning or other ways to think about unpacking learning for the kids that already learning it for the first time or are experiencing challenges in their growth and that sort of thing. So you know the first thing and we all know this is that all growth especially learning is non-linear. like it's not an A to B to see the sort of situation with any kid, you know, if we think back to all the teaching we've done, how many kids actually do the build on the old skill in a really clean fashion across time? Like I am very few. And those kids tend to be just kids that are naturally gifted, but they're not very many of them. We're teaching more, should be teaching more to like the two thirds that are easily captureable, easily like if we tell them these things, these things will turn into the kids doing stuff really well. That's part of the what I call the magic words philosophy or like, oh, don't say soft, say, you know, whatever, like there are people for whom like the specific language are used is really important. And in some cases, in very much is. But and this is the crux of the issue here a lot of what we kind of think and bring into it can cloud our vision actually what's happening with the students. And what they are and aren't picking up on that we're laying down. And so, you know, this idea that we have to create this perfect learning environment actually might not be the thing that serves them the absolute best. You know, I've taught with people, I've done it myself where we kind of, we sit there and go, you know, my kids can't make mistakes. Mistakes aren't an option. And one of the things that we'll talk about today, but also just kind of in general, is that actually mistakes are one of more valuable things in the learning process as long as they are scappled in the same way, like we talk to our kids about making better mistakes. Don't make the same mistake over again. Make a better mistake next time. And that is actually, research is starting to show kind of what we all are experienced is, is that we learn best by experience and we learn best by that sort of granular understanding that comes from doing the thing. And then. anything else from that maybe doesn't really work so well so we're gonna cover little bit of how we adapt those skills and adapt the things that we ask our kids to do based on our deeper understanding of what it is we're actually asking them to do so I guess the first question I have for either of you is what you know when you're thinking about learning like one of the things we think about are the challenges to learn and so like what are some of the challenges you see in your classroom that are either present enough they come to mind first or were memorable enough that they come to mind first I would say kids just getting frustrated like beginner specifically you know it's like they can't get the task that day and so they get frustrated and then they shut down so like how can I do something else in order to make them like not shut down @12:00 - Lauren Kaminski And, you know, keep pushing the other kids because, you know, sometimes at that point in the year, you have your kids that are up here, you have your middle, and then you have your bottom. And so sometimes it seems more often than not, it's the bottom that is getting frustrated. And so how do you keep the bottom? Like, hey, it's okay that you, and I will say like having Mario, like he kind of taught me, like he would tell the kids like, hey, it's your first time doing this. Why are you so upset? And so I'm like, huh, that's an interesting mindset that not that I wasn't encouraging to them, but like, yeah, this can be like, you're doing fine for it, just being your first time, but just trying around, you know, helping those bottom kids, like, hey, it's okay, don't give up. You do have to like, you know, take home your instrument and practice five minutes. I bet this will help you increase. @12:51 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Right. And I mean, that definitely resonates with my experience too. anybody who's every time beginners anywhere knows. being the father of two, three children also is a telling thing that I've dealt with, that sort of instant perfectionism as the only option a lot. @13:10 - Lauren Kaminski yeah, it's like, I'm not good at this. And it's like, you just, we just did it. @13:14 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, it's gonna be an expert right now. This is your first day, it's okay. @13:18 - Lauren Kaminski So just trying to like, you know, and like, you know, with all the curriculum that in my mind, like, we need to get through in sixth grade and like, how that's changed off the years with trying to keep the kids like more invested and like, you know, it's meals. I mean, like, you could spend hours on scales with clarinet, you know, and it's like, the kids don't really, truly care about that anymore, but like, trying to like, have a balance between, you know, hey, I'm teaching you the scales and I'm kind of giving it to you. I did have kids this year that like, went with it, and they like learned stuff on their own, which I haven't had in the last few years, like, they wanted me to see them everything. So, you know, trying to keep the curriculum engaging and you know still getting what I need to get done but also like not pushing scales so much or whatever one part of my curriculum that they're like well I don't this is boring but I can't do this you know the kids that can't cross the break as well I can't you know. @14:17 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Now there's one's upon the time that I would send kids to the office for saying can't like I said it's a cuss word and we're gonna send it and I did that once actually it was the the front office people were in on the gag but we got the point across we we didn't have much of that but at the same time like that's the atrix and that works for a small class of kids that want to be good but how many you know of those classes do we actually have. Ariana or is there anything that you've kind of noticed in your teaching or like barriers to learning or challenges your kids are having and Ariana's gonna walk by the way yeah sorry back country road in Virginia. @14:53 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) We're not that well I mean I'm in a neighborhood. Okay. It was really interesting that she brought up Lauren, that she brought up the perfectionism mixed with the lack of interest and skills, because I will say that I've seen that quite bit over the last couple of years since we came back from COVID. My biggest like hurdle is talking, not me talking, but the students, even though they want to learn everything is still like somehow we've still forgotten to be in a classroom. And we can't get as much done because they just want to talk and then they get mad that they're not as good at something. If you let me finish explaining something so we could do it, then we'd be better at it. So that's really like for somebody who felt like I had pretty good classroom management skills for so long. The last couple of years have really kind of thrown me. And it's not just me like we're seeing it across the school, across the district. from what I've read in a lot of, you know, forums and stuff, it's a relatively common thing since we've come back. But yeah, just trying to get the interest, you know, you sign up for the class, you want to be here. So what is it that you want to do? And some of it's not going to be super fun. I always told my kids, especially at the orchestra, the first year is so boring. Oh my gosh, beginning at orchestra. And, you know, we can hear what band is playing next door and beginning dance is so much more exciting. And they can play full pieces that are like super exciting because everybody writes for the beginning dance. And nobody writes for the beginning orchestra. And I'm like, stick with it. Just trust me that after this year, it's going to be way more fun. And so then we don't, when we do our concerts and they hear seventh and eighth grade, like, oh, but getting them to that point. And even getting my son at the eighth graders to keep pushing through the conversation has just been, it's really thrown. me. And it kind of made me a little scattered and like, kind of keep myself on track when you're talking about curriculum and, you know, balancing the needs of your class was like, I wanted, I want to stay on this topic and get this done, but that's not, you can't always go to that because we've got to focus on the class. That made sense. @17:21 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Oh, totally does. And I mean, I think what both of you have touched on is, I wouldn't take these are new problems, right? These have always been things that kids do and kids struggle with, especially the talking because I'm finding out, um, starts earlier than I thought it did. So the, but like COVID has not been kind to any of this. And even before COVID, kids being raised on screens has not been kind to any of this. One of the things that screens are designed to do is distract like they're meant to engage you, not by getting into like some sort of flow state where like you or one with a machine and whatever is going on, it's much more like you're just constantly distracted being in a casino, basically. A casino of attention is what a lot of people have called it, and that only exacerbates the problems that we're seeing or the challenges we're seeing our kids experience. know, the perfectionism kind of comes from that. Like, if I don't, there's very low cost to quitting things when the next thing is just to swipe away, right? If all you have is like, I hate to sound like my father was like, all I had was a, you know, an old ball to play with. So you figured out things to do with the ball. There is some validity to that, that kids don't experience tension or friction or even just boredom. They are missing some tools, and that could show up really big in the areas where they're learning and trying new things. But then also like the just the attention to task and being on task and understanding how exchange happens in classrooms, especially when there's hormones involved, which, you know, beginners, that's about when that starts to do isn't fun. Didn't we plan that well? The that can be tricky as well. So it's like, to me, I'd plan to talk a lot more about like kind of general ideas about differentiation and stuff like that, but you're raising things that are kind of a little closer to stuff I've been thinking about. So with your permission, mean, we could just explore these as kind of the the test bed for the stuff we're talking about. And like the biggest thing, I think that comes to mind on things we're talking about quote unquote are, you know, when we're looking for the kid to do xyz, what is the thing we're looking for and how well defined is it in our brain? You know, whether that is an actual like definition like a rubric or how well formed is the target. behavior in our brain in terms of I could describe the qualities of it and I could also show you how far away you are from whatever it is that I'm evaluating you against. Like when we think about that in a musical sense we probably have a pretty good repertoire of things to pull from. But are those things we're pulling from always where the kids need them to be, right? In the sense that we have these kind of plans of action for like how to play this note better on an instrument. But if the kids are swirly or kind of everywhere where they crumble, like I always call them like paper children, they just kind of burst into flames when anything goes wrong. You know those kind of mechanisms we use to teach stuff like do these steps or do this thing or you know A to B to C to D might not work. And so it's adapting the outcomes we're looking for to not just the tools we have. The tools are probably pretty good. But how the students work themselves into the tools is kind of, I think, the missing piece that is something that we can spend some time talking about. And so let's go back to your example, Lauren, of kids just kind of crumbling when something goes wrong. normally the kids in that bottom third in terms of their skill acquisition. And there's already things acting on them that make that kind of heightened, maybe too, depending on the kid. And so, like, I guess my question is, like, what are some of the skills you're seeing them kind of hit as a wall? Is it like really, really routine basic stuff? Or is it more advanced skills or the combining stuff? where do you kind of see that wall happen if you see it happen in one place? @21:49 - Lauren Kaminski You know, I feel like it depends on the day. Like, for some kids, sometimes it's like they might just be having a bad day. And so they come in and it's like, okay, like I'm just. It's gonna, you know, let him be, you know, but I would say probably, I feel like, kind of in the beginning, I feel like everyone, you know, kind of gets the first skills that we're doing. It's probably once we start kind of, you know, spring semester when we're doing harder skill sets, but that's when stuff happens or, you know, I had a few kids like break down around the winter music when we were preparing that for the concert. So I would kind of say, you know, I guess higher level skills and like around the winter concert for some kids. @22:38 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So, and like if, if memory serves, because it's been a while since I've done a beginner here, so like that also is for you, does that involve the entire ensemble playing together for the first time? @22:51 - Lauren Kaminski Or do they still do lines out of the book? We do. Each class does a song. Their own song and then we have a unison line that the whole band does. together, and then we do one piece that has like two different parts going on. And I mean, like I have two different clarinet parts. So I'm like teaching clarinet parts for the first time and kind of explaining what first part is and second part is and that kind of thing. @23:16 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay. And I mean, that's, you know, for beginners, that's challenging. part of me has to wonder kind of getting back to the perfectionism, the kind of fragile child, paper children's syndrome. How much or is any of the challenges you're experienced exacerbated by the social dimension that's kind of rushing in, right? You're kind of in your little bubble of the flute class with clarinet class or whatever it is. And then you kind of, you know, lack of a better term, stir up the bowl of skittles and you see everything all mixed together and some kids, that is hugely destabilizing. Even kids that aren't diagnosed as being on the spectrum tend to function that way a little bit more because because they don't have the same social cues. didn't grow up with them the same way, and there's little bubble of them that's kind of floating through the educational system. what you're describing, we're gonna see in about six years, and with some modifications, maybe. So I mean, I wonder, is that playing into it at all, or do you think it's removed enough from that, that it's not a direct link? @24:23 - Lauren Kaminski I don't know, you know, I know like one kid that he like threw a fit one day with our class song, and the next day he came back, we had a test later on that week, and he played it, and he played it, and I looked at him, and I was like, you got an A, that was amazing, what'd you do? I went home and practiced, okay, so you throw on a fit the other day that you couldn't get it, it's just because you hadn't done your stuff at home. So, you know, and I think we do, so like our classes all meet at the same time, so we have three beginner classes going, and so like we'll come find them, especially for the winter stuff, it gets closer, so like, hey, this is kind of what you can see, you know? And so they get to kind of be with their friends and everything. But I don't know, I just think, you know, kids learn at different rates. I know I look like math, I wasn't good at math, and I always laughed because we did some like smart math thing in high school. And it was like, we started at late, so we were doing skills that we had already learned, and then we were doing other stuff. And so I was like finally getting good with smart math on the skills that we had already been tested over. So I know, like, kids do hit stuff. It's just a matter of like, what can I do to like help keep them thinking, keep them in line, and like, just not giving up on themselves learning wise, and the pace of the class going, and not letting the class stall out, while they try to like, figure stuff out. @25:56 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, and since you guys are spread so thin with having three simultaneous. these classes and three directors, right? like, that's not good. You can't be like, Oh, somebody coming to do this thing. You know, I have to wonder, especially because practice at home kind of becomes the thing of like, that, you know, see, that works, but they have to kind of find it on their own. They can't be told anything because heaven, defend that someone knows something they don't. But is there a way to do something worth like, that not working? Okay. And like, have a thing that they do, whether it's like shadow play or whatever, like give them a routine, you should move on to the next person, but give them like a set of behaviors to do that also reinforces what it's like to break down a problem, like the thing we teach them to do when, you know, before they take their instrument homes, like, here's kind of how you think through something that doesn't work, how to make it work better. And so maybe something along those lines might be helpful, because then that also, like, like, to me, practice time is @27:00 - Lauren Kaminski like work if you make it that way and that like it was something I have to do it's like this thing I have to check off rather than like I have this thing that's not working I'm going to go spend some time on it like we want the kids to get to that place but they've got to see the payoff and this cohort is really payoff averse in terms of like if it's not there right away it's the end of the world and I will say sometimes you know kids will help each other so it's like if they can tell I'll move on and they're co-person you know because I mix up the kids I somewhat sat them in share order and then I kind of mix kids around that could help other kids and so I would move on and they would the kid next to me be like hey it's you know you got to do and so they would kind of step in also but sometimes I mean kids would not accept it's like they're just trying to help you like I had a kid get upset one time that a friend was trying to help them but for the most part like kids are very accepting of like each other trying to help them and I'm like fine with that. I'm like, maybe they can say it better than I'm saying it, you know, or they can clarify. so if I see a kid, you know, reaching over and helping or, you know, the kid knows like, hey, this person's better than me, I'll move on and they're like, hey, can you show me X, Y, or Z? @28:17 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Well, I think that plays into also this idea. And we've talked about this before in this course of like bands and really all the ensemble traditions, but band orchestras, choirs are the big ones in the US that are these like organisms that don't exist in other ways, other places. So if you think about the music of, you know, pick any country where it's like, oh, the music of this thing that's not like what we have in the West, most of their ensembles are not 50, 60 people minimum, right? They're, they're, you know, a collection of eight to 12 people, kind of what we would call chamber group size. We have to, as band directors and orchestra directors and bar directors think about the social structure and the social dimension of what we're doing and having kids have the skills to accept that help and to go, okay, this person is not criticizing me. I remember Mr. you know, you always say like first thing is like, I give you feedback. It's information. It's not criticism. It's never about you. It's about what you're doing. He was always really kind of overly pointed about that. But at the same time, kids need that clear boundary too, because a lot of them do not pick up on subtlety anymore. sarcasm is really hard to come back as sarcasm lives on subtlety. And it's just not landing with the children these days, for whatever reason. And so, you know, like, to me, that might be something to explore of maybe on the first day, you know, this is something we do in our vamper and we help each other. And if you're not okay with that, here's what you say and you just have some sort of like, you know, it's like putting the red card up at a child, like, don't give me any more food. But for the rest of the kids, it's almost like, I'm actually listening to podcast about Richard Thaler, who won the Nobel Prize for creating behavioral economics, and they talk about how when you have a default choice that ups you into something, like over 90% of people just leave it, they don't question, I'm sure whatever that's fine, and maybe treating something like, because it sounds like the kind they feel like they have to get it with you, or all those lost, and so they don't have any other tools to lean back off that creates this kind of, for some of them, really panicky, heightened sense of, ooh, I'm not good enough, which heaven knows they already do anyways, we don't need to help that, it's already there. And so maybe even something to be like, you know, we help each other in this band program, and here's what it looks like, here's how you don't want it, here's what you say, if you do want it, you just let the other person start talking, and they know we do. you get to set the rules for what helping looks like. we use the same words we use in class, but we might explain them a little bit differently. It might even just be like that kid needs five reps and you have time for two to that day. You know, like, because I remember observing student teacher in your class, and like you had 20 some odd, like it was a big flute class, which is great that's what you want, but like there's one of you and you kind of are limited, but the size program you have and the way your structure is set up, like you've got to adapt to that, but if the kids aren't getting it, we have to find other ways. So building that sort of autonomy and I'm okay, if you don't get it with me, turn to your person next to you when you guys can workshop it together or whatever that looks like, however you want to have that to be set up. That might be an option because what you're doing there is you're differentiating the task by extending the time the student gets suspended, like it's classic, you know, one of the accommodations you'd put on an IEP that also who doesn't belabor the fact that we are usually one to 60 or one to 25 or one to whatever big ratio in our classroom. so like additional time doesn't always scale to what we need to get done. So that might be something to think about. And I think the other thing too, and this is something we all struggle with as teachers, is defining what the minimum, like what is the thing that we're going to go, okay, that's good for today. It's really hard for some kids to know what that is because in their brain, for whatever reason, if it's not perfect, then it's not good enough. Like they have a binary relationship with things. And so for us as teachers and as musicians to define, okay, here are the things we're going to use to describe what I want you to do. Here's what it sounds like when I demonstrate it, or it sounds like when someone else in the class demonstrates it. But here's other areas that are going to be good enough. Like sometimes kids need that. And it might not take more than two or three times to do something along the lines of that. So they start building this image of like, oh, there's a range of what's acceptable. There's a, it's not a, you know, bull's eye or nothing. Like, and we know, like, if they hold the sound still on that first day, we're really happy. Like, you're doing great, kid. But some of the kids are so scared. And we see this with the undergrads, too. Like, they are terrified to say something wrong, which that's been around forever. Like, I felt that way in music school. know you both did a high cost of being wrong in the school of music. But these kids are almost paralyzed by it. Because even more, even once it's clear that there are no stakes for saying something wrong and sense of like, you're going to be made fun of, they still do not want to put their money out there. They're really reticent to kind of bite at things. And then once they do, they do what you'd expect them to do. get really into it. It's great. but needing them to make that decision is hard. like you said, it's about making things sticky. Oh, there I am, must be home now. It's also about making things sticky in the sense of, we want the, I always tell the undergrads, like you're going remember about 10% of the things we do in this class. It's one of them to make sure that 10% you remember is the stuff that helps you the best. And so finding a way to make the things that really need to be sticky stick. So, you know, like you said, the basic fundamentals of things, kids tend to pick up really well and it's getting them to be comfortable with kind of putting things together, you know, like the two-headed monster on Sesame Street. Like these two skills that they do is together and becomes a new thing. And that also might be another place where letting them kind of have the freedom to spin out a little bit, not literally, figuratively, work with their person, can't beat you in the next round. And then you're going to have a couple kids make up. Like, you can play that however you work for your flow in your classroom. But I think giving them that autonomy, but then also showing them, you know, here's what it sounds like at the beginning, and it's kind of like at the end, and that's not all about just being here, it's about the growth to get there, and all the things we tell them to keep them engaged, because you know, those bottom kids, I don't know about you, but I was one of those bottom kids once, like, I wasn't always in the wind ensemble, especially when I switched instruments, I used to put trumpet, and then I figured, no, I'm not going to get a high enough chair doing that, so I switched to French horn, because that's what you could do in Pennsylvania at that time, because there was no competition for things like that, but you know, like these kids also deserve a visual experience, and so most of time it boils down to the quantity of time we don't have, and the way that we're spread so thin in our classroom, especially with beginners. You know the classroom control thing too is Like we have to we have to find her comfortable about that like we're taught really early on that the best classrooms are silent Right like if you're focused and they're studying and they're doing all the things I mean maybe sometimes that happens, but usually in the classrooms that I've felt like I've learned the most It's only like that sometimes. It's only like that when someone is talking You know like when everyone's listening while everyone's talking and then once that person's done talking There's a thing that happens whether it's we talk about their cells questions, it is Those tend to be the classrooms the interactive classrooms tend to be the ones that are More conducive to learning, but that's harder to do with big groups with middle schoolers Especially with beginner instrumentalists. It's like hurting cats that are on catnip so You know the the question there is you know, we're not even getting far enough into the higher or even needs to start talking about like transformational stuff. We're talking about like keeping the lights on and keeping shelter over our head, that these kids can't get passed, like just how to be in society. And so, you know, like where's the failing? I don't think there's anyone thinking we can point to, but what can we do to augment it? And so, you know, for that, if you tried going way back to basics and having them stand in hallway, Ariana, like right shoulder to the wall and quiet and all the things. @37:30 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) Oh yeah, like we've spent over half a class period at a time doing that. We've repeated it, you know, every other day since I don't see them every day, got over an emailed home reminder of things like it's all, I didn't sign up for the, I didn't look at it yet, but this got laying the backpack that he sent out this year, which is supposed to be like a last room agreement. type thing that you set up with your classes and so I was just curious and I was like let me sign up for it and see what it looks like in all of my free time which I clearly have since I'm doing my two mile walks at nine o'clock at night you know I have not looked at it yet so I'm curious just because maybe that's the thing that gets these kids this year I don't know as far as instructionally aside from talking if I can shift just slightly my biggest instructional issue outside of the talking has been transferring of skills like okay like I have had to because I had to pick up violin so quickly because I had no idea what I was doing I've even noticed this oftentimes I'll read in intervals instead of actually paying attention to the notes that are happening because I don't have time to think about what's happening as I'm trying to keep up with my eighth graders who are obviously playing more than I am at at their level because they get to spend more time teaching them music than playing it with them. But the transference of like, okay, you're going to play open one, two, and then guess what we're going to do on the next string? Open one, two, three, and everything goes up one letter in the alphabet. one or open one, three, four, unless it's base, in which case bases have to shift just to play one scale. It's a lot for them. But like, my students have not been able to, sorry, my husband just needs to bless you. I've not been able to transfer the idea of literally it's the exact same finger pattern on all four strings. All four, one letter at a time. Like, for some reason, especially this past year, like it never clicked, never. And I thought of every possible way that I could come up with to explain it. And I feel like I failed miserably. mean, we got through music by then, you know, when it was all said and done. But now I'm like, okay, how do we avoid that coming year? And it's to the point that I've actually thought about going slightly Suzuki and having them play notes before they see them on a staff. Not too far. Like I don't want them learning full pieces of music and then throwing, you know, at them. But like, okay, let's learn how to play Open D. Okay, here's what you just played and this is what it looks like. Because I thought maybe with this group, it was just too much information at once. I don't know. I can't, it can't hurt anything to try it that way. If I quickly see that it's not working, then we just shift gears and go back to, you know, Plan A. But that transference of knowledge, which I always felt like I was very good about stacking suddenly felt like I didn't know what I was doing at all because it just wasn't, it didn't click this year. And I think probably talking was a part of that where there was was never enough focused to just, oh, I'm doing the same thing over and over again. It just, there was never enough attention. I mean, I don't know, I grew up in a program that is like, I don't know about now, but at the time, hadn't gotten anything less than a superior and over 20 something years. didn't talk. Failure was not an option. It was, so that was what I was so used to. And I don't regret that. actually quite enjoyed it. It made me very competitive. I think it turned me into the better. I mean, I saw the kids when that, because they laugh, because I'll sing along to like essential elements, lines as band plays next door. And they're like, how do you know this? I'm like, well, know, back in the 1900s, when their music was on a cassette tape, I would rewind the track and I would practice for an hour. they're like, what is rewind me? What's like a sat tape? you practice for an hour. or I don't take my instrument home. like, there's that huge disconnect because obviously the teachers are the ones who we are those nerds who took our instruments home and worked all the time. And so trying to be like, okay, you didn't practice at home. Let's give you some time here. But also we do need to push forward and figuring out what didn't work last year and how to make it work this year. @42:27 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I mean, I think the thing that stands out to me the most, there is, you know, transfer of learning is something that kind of is a course to water for a situation, right? Like you can't make, you can make them to a certain point, but then they have to be like, oh yeah, thing. Like I know the way I learned how to teach going over the break and not make it something scary was flip their instrument around. So I'm holding it in their mouth and I control everything. so they do the same error, do the exact same thing. And, you know, we do... Really basic limited stuff, but to show them like going to the break, you don't change anything. It's just your fingers and That kind of narrow the the attention of like things that are scary about this this Right, but that was just an demonstration in front of the kids like for whatever reason that stuck And I think you're doing the right thing around and like going I'm gonna try this one thing this year I'm gonna try this one try the contract within this year But I guess then then my question is like what is living kind of before that in in this chain of dominoes Like what is the thing that's typically the domino that makes you have to go get a behavioral contract? What are they coming in with something? Are they is it truly just to change in the students? Sorry everything just went to nighttime mode, so it's literally a little bit You know like Is there a change in the school culture if they're just a change in the way kids are like and this is where we all kind of Guard ourselves against sounding like our parents, but at the same time super generations of different personalities. So, where do you think your specific issue kind of lives maybe? @44:07 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) I mean, we are about to have our fourth superintendent in my 10 years here. We are on our third principle, not counting acting principles in the interim in my 10 years here. This past year so there was a big shift. doesn't explain sixth graders coming in necessarily because it didn't matter if he was new or not. Everybody, anybody would have been new to him. But a school culture shift and how we address, we have extremely high teacher turnover. This year I think we only lost, I'm probably going to get a from the other room in a minute, but I think only like 10 to 15. We usually it's closer to 30, and they're almost always brand new teachers, so the school culture alone is harder to address in one classroom when everybody's new and everybody's hair is on fire all the time, you know. Even if I might have my rules, they may or may not be the same as another teacher who has done this forever, who has never done this before, or isn't licensed to teach and has never been in school since they got out of school, you know, so it's a very I don't want to say it's a difficult school, it's not that, it's just that it's a difficult environment sometimes because it's changing constantly, there's a lack of consistency, so I think that's felt across the student body, whether they realize it or not, like obviously like I said the sixth graders won't feel that, it's just somewhere new for them. do feel like mature 30 levels are different. We're seeing this weird thing with technology, and I've told my kids before, like, it used to be like, when I got the internet, you know, way back when it was dialups, that if you wouldn't say something to somebody's face, you wouldn't say it online because it was mean, and now the kids are growing up saying mean things online first, and so they have no problem saying those things to people's faces because all the US trash talk each other online with their access to games and things like that, and so we're seeing some of that, and I was going somewhere else with that and I don't remember where. What was it? I don't know, but just the maturity. So we have this weird thing where they're exposed to things that they probably shouldn't be exposed to at younger ages, so in some ways like they're not necessarily more mature, but they've been around more mature things. But like Laura was saying, I have more kids that whose hands need to be held figuratively. They really are so scared of doing it wrong, or they've never had to problem-solve themselves. They need somebody to tell them every single step of the way, my kids just turn six, but when they're like three and four, I'm like, figure it out. don't solve the world's problems, but there's an issue in front of you that you're capable of solving what's solved it, and I always tell them, know, I'm giving you the tools you need to be successful. It's up to you to use them. And then kind of like you were saying with Mr. Green, like I always tell kids, like, it's not personal. I promise you, you'll know if it's personal, but I'm addressing something. It's just because it's something that needs to be fixed. It doesn't mean you're horrible. It doesn't mean you're a bad player or a bad person. Just means you did something wrong. got to address and we move on, and it's no big deal. And some kids take that very internal. and I'm like, I, as somebody who internalizes everything, I wouldn't do that to you. Like, because I understand what that would feel like. But yeah, just kind of feeling that, I think that is also part of that level of immaturity that we're seeing is that they don't know how to handle when we address them. They don't get that it's for the greater good, not because they're bad at something. It doesn't mean they're bad. It's just that your finger is low too. It's like, you know, mean going around with the trombones and it Pam, Pam Beasley from the office and it's like, second position, third position, what's the difference? They're the same thing, know, for my kids, it's low too. I, at our spring concert, I'm like, well, too, well, too to one of my violins this year, because she, you're playing regular too, but I'm like, it's like, try not to be loud enough for the audience to hear it. Right. Right, exactly. So just those There's little things without them taking it personally, but also just getting through it and applying it. @49:09 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, and I mean that's something where we maybe have to kind of help them and be much more maybe structured than we might otherwise want to be because like you pointed out Lauren, like some of these kids need to be handheld all the way through and maybe some of them don't come from homes where they have to think on their own, you know, like we've all come across the helicopter parent or the lawnmower parent or the bulldozer parent or whatever piece of construction equipment that we're talking about the parents operating to defend their child from all adversity. So we know what that's like, but you know, we also know we have to find a way ideally to integrate those kids into a group that is probably cut from different kids than them. And so a lot of times it's, you know, what's the pathway to this thing I need to do and there's actually some really interesting book you might have come across, some of them might not have come across others. There's three that have really stood out to me in recent kind of coinage, because there's a lot of these out here that are interesting but not actually helpful, and these kind of hit both targets of being interesting and helpful. The first one is this guy named Josh Weitzken, who if you've seen the movie Finding Bobby Fisher, like it's about this kid, like he was Trust Grandmaster at H14, like one of those mostly talented kids, and he wrote a book all about the way he learned, and you kind of have to grit your teeth, because he's very, it reads like maybe some other Silicon Valley people might read, that sort of, I am the god among men from Etheostown from the Mountain sort of thing, so you have to get past that, but he does a lot where he talks about this is one of the things I think that was really well for us as musicians of space repetition, like we're going to do this thing at this interval between and we do stuff in between, but then also this idea of incremental learning and breaking it down into the smallest piece. And like one of the things that I've pulled from that and I've tried to apply is how do we give the kids the tools to break down the thing that's challenging them into something they can't accomplish, and then something else they can accomplish, then they chain those things together into the third thing. And however many steps it takes, because we don't have the time to do that for them. wish we could in the best of all possible worlds we can, but that's not where we live. And so, you know, books like that, it's called The Art of Learning, and I'll send a summary over to you in the morning. It is, again, you have to kind of get around the tone that he writes with, but he does point some things out. And a lot of it is stuff that we as teachers can do more to install into our programs. And this is what I mean by that. We have a collection of kids in front of us at any given time, any ensemble, any class that can do things independent of us, and it's pretty rare that we take advantage of that in a meaningful way. When they play, they're doing stuff on their own, but that's kind of in coordination with us. We kind of are holding their hands in some ways there. But do we have any place for them to not be off the rails, but to have some autonomy, to have some areas to explore in so that we can teach them steps, like how to break this down into this thing, how to break this down into this thing without me being there. So what's the thing that's challenging you? I can't do that thing. Okay, what are the things we need to do to do that? for you, especially for you, Ariana, this actually might help you in becoming more familiar with kind of the extended parts of the instruments that you would, you know, if you're going to talk them through like a checklist almost. There's another great book. don't have a sorry this ready, but I can get it ready. Call the checklist manifestos by a doctor named Atul Gawande. Okay. Um, he's a, I think he was an ER doctor. could be wrong about that. What he found though was all of these surgical mistakes were coming about because everybody thought somebody else had done it. So they created basically a checklist to do these things where this person is going to walk out with gods in their body. So the stakes are a lot higher, but the idea of a kid being able to create like, okay, what are the things I'm doing to make this thing happen? Whatever it is, going, you know, doing a shift, whether it's playing an octave slur on flute, whether it's, you know, the chromatic scale that makes everyone cry on clarinet. You know, whatever it is, how, how can they focus down to the thing that is going to, once they fix it, be the news of difference. And I think empowering kids to have that is something that doesn't happen overnight. But if we have it as a goal, we start to develop kids that are helpful. one to themselves, but also other people, it can be more that when we help each other, this is what we fill it with. We were talking about that earlier, Lauren. But the other thing is that they are going to be assets to the group as well because they are not going to, unless it's really severe, add problems to the list of things. They're going to try and fix their own problems first. part of that is motivation. like you said, it's hard to get these kids excited about stuff because there's all this other noise happening in their lives. And the thing that kept on coming to mind there, and this doesn't apply equally in both situations at all, but this kind of idea that things outside of the room are in, outside of the orchestra, outside of band hall are chaos at any given time. They're just nuts. some time with hallways, you'll hear it. Come into our room, very ordered, where we have our things, we but then how much of that can we spin? and got a lot of energy into like, is it Miss Penny, whatever her name is in Matilda, the movie, the rolled doll movie, Miss Honey? Yeah, her. Yes. That like, not Miss Frizzle, what we can do Miss Frizzle little too easily. But Miss Honey, where it's like you are the the reason part of the reason why the kids come to your room is because it is that place where they feel safe and all these things. And I think we kind of get the safe space and all like the kind of leftist language kind of frets that down and makes it sound unappealing. But at the end of the day, how much can we project that to the kids? By the way, we teach them how to handle problems, right? The biggest problem with chaos is you don't know how to enter it to make anything make sense. But we'll teach you a way here to take the thing that's not making sense and at least find one step you can take to making it better and then take another step and another step. And that's hard. Like, I don't have an answer for what that looks like specifically. to each of us. But I think if we turn our attention to it, it'll ordeal itself. Because it's going to be built on the things you already know how to do well and feel comfortable getting kids to do. It's just a matter of getting them to use those same tools, and then check back in with you. Because that's the other thing you do is you introduce variability into what they decide to do with the thing. And so that's a question of training. Like when we start them off, when we have the conversation, same conversation maybe as we help each other in here is, here are the things we think are the most important. Our sound stays still, our sound is good, or whatever, however that lives. We work together, we never worked against each other, whatever that is. Because a lot of this I think is coming down to not the content we have, but how the kids connect and get into the content. Like what's their entry point? And I think you both identified that the entry point is, if not completely different, at least different enough that it doesn't. and map to what we've done before. And you're both a good enough teacher if you're finding your feet, in terms of making something work to make the thing happen using the old content and maybe a new way of approaching it. But I guess my question is, how can we take the content without changing it, without watering it down? you talked about Lauren, like nobody wants to do scales anymore. True, I I'm not sure they ever want to do scales. think we did them because we had to. But, and not even like, how can we make it fun and gamify? think that's gonna, you're gonna see a lot of technology solutions that are gonna do things like that for the reason you're pointing out. It's, you know, kids are just wondering. But how can we take the actual ideas themselves? Whether they're note names, whether they're, you know, pitch organizations, whether they're more higher-end things like style and articulation and make them stickier. So we don't have to basically re-teach them. over and over again. They stick and we can build on them. And one of the things is another book that you're going get a summary of is called Make It Stick. Can we either of you come across that before? It's actually really interesting book in the education space that talks about literally how people learn and one of the things it brings up to, similar to the first one we talk about, it's a space repetition of like we do it here and then we're going to wait little while and we do it here and we do it really intensely in those two spots, but we don't touch it in between which like for us as teachers scares us and it's probably not something you're going to apply to everything, but in both of these books explore what's kind of the boundary of things that are affected by this and where just the complexity of the task is too much, it doesn't work. So the other thing there too though is this idea of effortful learning like that you have to put some skin in the game, you have to try this thing and you know the other thing that I worked on kind of later in my career was this idea of you know if you don't think it's going to work but I'm asking you to do do it. I want you to at least try it. Just like when you're a little kid, you got some, you know, whatever the thing is, you don't want to eat. You just have to try a little bit of it. And if you do, fine. Because nine times out of ten, the thing that I wanted them to do, they didn't want to do, works. So it's more to get them over that. But then finding those levers with kids, I think, is a really important thing that they have to put some effort into it, but that the effort is returned by the positive reward. Now, part of that is where we set the reward. Is the reward playing the time of your scale? Or in the case of kids learning, you know, open one, one, three, four, whatever it is, that you can go, okay, next one's going to start on the G string. And like, hopefully it's not G string. But the, like, they have to jump and do the thing. And that's the reward there. It's not that they're learning it's transferable. that, oh, did that thing, and I did it fast and I did it faster than the next person, whatever it is. And so all of a sudden, then you can start to refine things, okay? Hey, now, it's not just who's fastest, who sounds the best, like you can start playing that game. And so it's a matter of, again, meeting them where they are, but not with the content. It's the pathway you create to the content. And heaven knows TikTok is not going to do us any favors in letting kids have longer attention spans moving forward. Like that's just not what happened, I don't think. And so it's up to us to find ways around that. And one of the ways we know is to return dopamine really, really quickly to get a kid hooked. It's the same thing as the candy does, same things that cigarettes do. It gets that dopamine loop happening. all of a sudden the kid is in it to win it. So it's finding those. And actually a third book and then a lead to be to consider picking up. this, if you don't buy any of the books, this I think is the best one to buy for what we do. It's called intelligent music teaching by a guy named Bob Duke. He is music at University of Texas. And well, music and human wondering is what they call it. They're because they want to be very specific. It's true. That's what they study and do a very good job of it. It has a lot of things in there that I think help clarify teaching. In fact, if I would never do it because it's his book, but I would love to teach a course just of this book for a summer thing, where it's kind of a pick up session, because it's these little essays. They're, I think, the longest is maybe 20 pages. it's all these different aspects of learning and how we learn the music and the things we assume are happening that maybe actually aren't happening in ways that we can think differently to be closer to what the kids are actually doing, but also kind of spin their effort back on itself to kind of build them into a little dynamo much faster. you want to think of it that way, it's a great book. It's pretty inexpensive. I think it's like maybe 18 bucks on Amazon and it's thin. It's very slender. It's just a little wisp of a book. But in terms of thinking about how students learn, I think that's a really great book to check out. I'll send you the outline where we talked through today, but all. So the summary and the transcript and book recommendations in the video tomorrow in the morning. Thank you guys for being here. It was good to see both of you. I'm glad you didn't get hit by a car this time, Ariana. ACTION ITEM: Send Lauren and Ariana summary and transcript of call, links to recommended books (The Art of Learning, Checklist Manifesto, Intelligent Music Teaching), and video recording - WATCH Not that you did last time, but there was concern and Lauren was good seeing you. @1:02:18 - Lauren Kaminski Yes, same. I was going to say about the candy and stuff. We started doing tetric boards before Christmas. And so I told the kids, I was like, all right, to earn a sticker, it's this tempo. If you want candy to try to like encourage more dexterity and fingers quicker, like it's this tempo. I mean, kids wanted that candy. mean, once the very first time we did like, no one really wanted to volunteer. So I kind of pushed on the kids that I knew would be successful and made them fall and told them. But it kind of like, you know, once the kids kind of saw like some success from other kids, like, I mean, they would come in, are we going to do tetra cords today? Are we going to get to, you know, It was just so funny that it's like candy tempo or a sticker tempo. Oh, tempo. @1:03:04 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You know, it's just amazing. @1:03:06 - Lauren Kaminski Candy does. @1:03:07 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Mm hmm. I mean, and that's the thing though, like, we're finding that even though these kids present very weirdly, they are the same kids we talked before. There's just a different pathway to get to what you've discovered. like the place where they get they do the thing that all kids do and they light up like a light bulb. Yeah. @1:03:23 - Lauren Kaminski ice cream sandwiches when we got when we got into scales, it was like, okay, with multiple octaves. So it was like, all right, if you get your region eight, and for the planets, I made it a six to make them feel a little more successful because their skills are harder. But I'm like, you get a star and an ice cream sandwich, and then you get your other scale sheet. And so then you can earn something else. And so that was my mildly successful, like I had planets that like, you know, wanted that ice cream sandwich. And so they got their six and then they finished, I helped them finish off their others. But it's just kind of, I'm like, always like, okay, what can like kind of put them in want to. And I, you know, I did videos for flutes and the other woodwind stuff I teach, I don't really do the videos, but with clarinets, there's so much specific like things, greens. I did videos and I posted them into our Schoology. And so some kids like, Hey, you can go rewatch this. Like we did it in class today. But guess what? talked about it and explain it in this video. So some kids would go and rewatch the video and some that would struggle in class. It's like, well, did you watch my video? Well, no, I guess I can. like, well, it's going to go step by step for you at home. It's like having me at your house trying to get them even just like use the Schoology videos. Like I made these videos. You know, I wish I don't think they got used as much. I know some students use them, but more kids would like buy into like, Hey, it's okay if I, you know, go home and figure this out or go home and she went over this in class. @1:04:56 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I didn't get it. And now it's in a literally a video. @1:05:00 - Lauren Kaminski I'm always like, how can I you know help and kind of like you said buy them in like get them get them in Yeah, and I mean that's amazing that you've done even not even what you've done. @1:05:12 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You've done like that is a lot of It's captured a couple kids along the way. I'm guessing It's like I think the other thing maybe that that we as teachers kind of need to wrap our branch around It's it's not pleasant is that these kids are like whereas before they were like maybe three or four things Everybody's into now. They're like thousands like they're into a little bit of everything It's what some theres called the long tail of the internet where like you can do with a thousand other people that like that very specific thing because the internet connects you from all over the world and so You know that we don't have those same pressures and things to pull on so I think anything you can do to Kind of help them is good But it might need to be a bunch of different things to capture a bunch of different kids You have in their classroom and so like this idea that we all have as teachers of the silver bullet that solves all the problems was never a reality before, but sometimes it worked. I think it's less than less effective now, and I think you touched on it really well, Lauren, with like having to do a bunch of different things to capture kind of enough kid that you see the progress you want to have. And I think that's, and if we're thinking about student learning, the first thing that is vital and central there is thinking about student learning. Like what are they doing, and how are they doing, and how can we, and you both do this, connect what they are doing with the steps they need to do, the thing we want them to accomplish. And sometimes it's a really easy transfer, sometimes it is a much further transfer, and so we need to kind of build back. But you know, the fact that one of the things that came up is this idea of community, this thing of culture, or this thing of, you know, help each other, like that starts to get into kind of the social emotional stuff too, which I know is, you know, anathema in some conversations, but at the same time, it's always been part of how we teach music and arts. so I think that's something to consider, too, that both of you from where you're talking sound like is installed in your thinking, always using everything as an opportunity to build on both at the same time. So where you're building community, it also helps the skill achievement or that sort of thing. Big brothers, big sisters, big buddies, whatever term you want to use for that might be a way to kind of want to extend your reach, or given that you're one person of how many, but two, allow you to kind of give those eighth graders that are chopping at the bit, something that is, there's consistently, it's not a special thing, so they can act like a twerp. They'll get out of the act feeling a twerp phase and get into actually being humans about it if you give them enough time. And so I think the stuff you both said you do is exactly what you need to do, but I don't need to do that because this stuff you do works. But at the end of the day, I think these three books are kind of good things to have in the back of your brain. But the thinking about it's not the content necessarily, the content is good, content works. know, the content has stood the test of time in a lot of ways to achieve the ends it wants to achieve. But are we then our job then becomes how do we connect the kids experience what they naturally gravitate towards and how they navigate the world with the stuff we want them to do. And those connection points kind of got fried during COVID in a lot of ways in ways that we're learning every year. So I don't envy you that. We're dealing with, you know, a lesser version of it just with way better hiding skills in the college. But at least you can identify what it is. And that gives you a much better chance of hitting the target now that you've figured out what it isn't. It's not the content. It's not your teaching. It's connecting the kids with the stuff you bring. And that's not easy. And hopefully these books, these outlines of this stuff will be a place for you to build a couple of ideas that work this year. @1:09:06 - Lauren Kaminski Yeah. Thanks. @1:09:08 - Ariana Kramer (She/Her) It was very interesting. @1:09:10 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) The time went by fast. Cool. I'm happy to be a lovely waste of time. I will see. @1:09:17 - Lauren Kaminski I'm like, my brain's already kind of like turning. So it's kind of, you know, just a different way of thinking about next year. @1:09:24 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Good. Yeah. mean, that's really what this is supposed to be. @1:09:27 - Lauren Kaminski a way for us like it's yoga for your brain. @1:09:29 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah. don't have to think about me doing yoga. @1:09:33 - Lauren Kaminski would not be successful.

The focus shifted from disconnected units based solely on performance literature to overarching \"threads\" or \"strands\" of fundamental musical skills that span the entire year. This approach emphasizes active learning, with students demonstrating skills through application rather than passive instruction. To build student ownership and accountability, strategies such as short individual practice times during rehearsals, student-led warm-ups, and scrambled seating arrangements were proposed. The goal is to develop students' problem-solving abilities and musical independence. Implementation ideas include identifying core skill threads (like tone, articulation, and ensemble playing) that apply across all literature, incorporating structured \"chaos\" to boost engagement, using short timed practice sessions, and having students explain their practice strategies. By framing ensemble improvement in terms of individual contributions and accountability, educators aim to create a curriculum that goes beyond performance obligations, fosters musical independence, and prepares students to be mature, skilled performers after graduating. The key to this approach is consistently revisiting fundamental skills across all literature while gradually empowering students to take ownership of their musical development, providing flexibility in repertoire selection while systematically building transferable core abilities. Key Takeaways * Instead of teaching in disconnected units based solely on performance literature, the group discussed having overarching \"threads\" or \"strands\" of fundamental musical skills (tone, articulation, ensemble playing, etc.) that span the entire academic year. * These skill threads would be revisited consistently across any literature studied, providing a cohesive focus beyond just performance obligations. * There was an emphasis on students actively demonstrating learning through the application of skills, not just being taught techniques by the teacher. * Strategies were explored for giving students ownership, such as short individual practice times, having them lead warmups, scrambling seating, etc. This builds personal accountability. * The group highlighted the difference between teaching techniques and actual learning when students can independently apply those techniques. * A key goal was developing students' problem-solving ability as musicians, preparing them for independence after graduating from the music program. Topics Curriculum Threads/Strands The traditional approach of teaching disconnected units based on performance literature was challenged. Instead, the group advocated for identifying overarching \"threads\" or \"strands\" of fundamental musical skills that could connect all the literature studied throughout the year. These fundamental skills, such as tone production, articulation, ensemble playing, sight-reading, etc., apply to any piece of music. By consistently revisiting and developing these skills across all literature, students would build a strong musical foundation rather than just preparing separate concert programs. This thread-based approach provides more flexibility in choosing literature while systematically developing core abilities that transfer to any music. It gives the curriculum a cohesive focus beyond just performance obligations. Application of Learning Simply teaching techniques is not enough - students must have opportunities to actively apply those skills individually, away from the teacher's observation. This independent application demonstrates true learning has occurred beyond just being taught. Strategies were discussed for facilitating this, such as: * Giving students short individual practice times during rehearsals to work on skills * Having students lead warmup exercises * Scrambling the ensemble's seating to create new listening environments This helps build students' personal accountability as musicians and problem-solving abilities since the teacher is not constantly watching over them. Challenges in Connecting Fall/Spring The educators shared the challenges they face in trying to connect the fall and spring semesters cohesively: * Andrea (who is planning to submit for honor band) has to balance preparing very difficult UIL contest literature for the spring while still making time for more engaging/fun music for concerts. * Ariana, coming from a band background, sometimes struggles to identify which fundamental string technique skills to prioritize teaching her orchestra students. * The constant demands of performances can make it difficult to maintain a consistent focus on skill development throughout the year. Embracing Structured \"Chaos\" While rehearsals need structure, the group discussed the value of occasionally embracing productive \"chaos\" or freedom for students. This helps build relationships and empowers them to take ownership. Strategies included: * Doing scrambled seating like a circle orchestra for a change of perspective * Using timers to give short bursts of individual practice time during rehearsals * Suggesting different practice strategies besides just straight repetition * Allowing these less-structured environments gives students a break from constant teaching while still reinforcing skills. Next Steps Some key next steps were identified: * Ariana will connect with an outgoing string faculty member for advice on fundamental technique skills to prioritize teaching orchestra students. * Both will explore warm-up books and other resources for systematic technique development. * They will implement short individual practice times within rehearsals, guiding students to use specific strategies. * Moments of structured \"chaos,\" like circle seating, will be built into rehearsal plans to empower students. The goal is to develop independent, problem-solving musicians who can apply their skills beyond following the teacher's instructions. It is crucial to connect the fall and spring with consistent skill development threads. Transcript @7:15 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) But okay, done tap dancing. I think we've got everybody here that's going to be here today. So um, but what I was going to offer is, you know, I wasn't super happy with the quads that you got tried to get through on Tuesday and then like we ran out and time we ran over. So I changed the script a little bit today. There's not going to be a power point. going to be much more of a discussion based session in Ariana. know you probably doing bedtime kid things or dealing with kids at bedtime. @7:47 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) I'm actually on my walk because I haven't gotten to do that yet today. @7:52 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay, well, excellent. Well, feel free to chime in whenever. We are we're talking and you know, thing I wanted to talk about today. @8:00 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So @8:00 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) That again, I'm sorry. @8:00 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Were y'all talking about honor band? @8:03 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, we're just kind of doing the blow by blow Dawson high school one. @8:07 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) OK, in six, which, wow. @8:10 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, I mean, Aaron's going to have a year because he's doing Midwest. He's doing honor band. They're going to make state marching contest because of the area they're in. So he's going to need a bit of a sabbatical. @8:22 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) I think he should just take April and and may off and just kind of do his own thing. @8:27 - Andrea T. Maher Crazy. OK, cool. @8:30 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So yeah, it's a good time down here in Texas. @8:34 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Sounds like it. @8:35 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Um, but today what I wanted to talk about is kind of something I know we all do. I know we're all familiar with how this works. And so rather than be like, here's this new idea, I wanted to kind of talk through some of ways I think about it and then actually have a chance to kind of workshop some ideas and see what we think about this, this idea of curriculum as something that's not boring. Um, I don't know. if you're, when you came into the profession, if the vertical alignment thing was still a thing in professional development, I know when I started teaching in Keller and O2, that was like the thing you did in fine arts PD, if you weren't, if you actually got fine arts PD, you did vertical alignment between your middle school and high school and make sure everything all lines up, and it's not that, it's not what we're talking about today. That's so important, it's very tedious and has a lot of value, but is, again, tedious and not for doing things over Zoom. There's no refreshing about that. But the thing that keeps on coming to mind for me, and this has been something that's kind of rattled around my brain a lot and finally landed on something that I think I can call it a, like give it a name. And that is this idea of, we often think in units when we're teaching, like I have to do this thing till this date. And then I do this thing until this date. then we just kind of like look at all our performance obligations and auditions and things and work backwards, which is great because that lets us plan out a year. But there are things we miss if that's the only way we look at it. And it's unlikely that any one of us on this call only look at it that way, but there's a temptation, especially for younger teachers to look at it that way. And so, what I wanted to do is talk about kind of ways to think through the year or ways that I've thought of to think of through the year that might help one give y'all who are experiencing teachers more tools, but two younger teachers, they can get kind of caught in that getting slapped in the face every two weeks with something I need to do. This kind of gives them a thread to hang on to that at least in the midst of that, which is just part of a new job, they can still make forward progress on areas within what they want to cover. But before we get into that too deeply, but think about that. What are some things that come to mind for you about challenges that crop up when you're trying to maintain some sort of cohesive through line or some kind of central focus to your curriculum through an academic year? What are some things that are challenging about deploying the curriculum you want throughout your, you know, your hundred and eighty days in front of the kids? @11:30 - Andrea T. Maher Well, for me, this upcoming year is a triple C honor band year. And so, you know, I've already I've already been in contact with my clinician since May already looking at what's going to be our UIL program, whatever some possibilities, and then backtracking from there, like, okay, if I'm going to play this, what am I going to play at Christmas to help build skills into that? And to me, I mean, it's really great the way that works, but the downs side of that is there's no spring concert with like fun movie music and pop tunes and the end of the year like the musical reward for all this hard work like we go straight all the way to mid May 11th 15th with the same music the whole spring semester and and that's what we do but at the same time all the rest of the bands get to do the fun stuff the fun music and to make this hard lit this hard uil lit fun for the kids and fresh all the way from December one to the end of the year is is a challenge yeah I can imagine and you know with with that too like it's you can kind of paint it as like okay you're the top ensemble this is a cool thing we get to do nobody else has access to but it can be a grind I'm sure like what are you thinking through your program like what are some Considerations you have for what you're gonna play for that There's a piece called Helios on the great four lists that we're looking at and then we're trying to figure out What to put with it? We're actually gonna look at a grade three and see like maybe the old red mill or variations on Scarborough fair or something like that because in the past I've done a great five and and this year two really hard grade fours and It wasn't as successful as it needed to have men or should have been so You know trying to find that fine line of a program that's competitive, but also Really really good. It's got to be amazing. @13:44 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So It's a challenge Yeah, that would be a challenge and you know I think one of the things the honor band process does do like you said is it creates this kind of runway for you because you have to think back Through okay, this is the spring what I'm doing in the in the fall and have and that actually ties really well into what we're talking about today. But that's not to say that playing the same three pieces for an entire semester is not a stream on everyone, including the teacher. @14:13 - Andrea T. Maher So what about Ariana? Like, I'd be curious what your answer is being in Virginia. Like, what is that for you? @14:23 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So, for me, my big struggle, think, is that orchestra still isn't really my home base. So, sometimes they don't really know what I'm missing. If that makes sense, I don't know what are things that I should have done by now. last year, this past year was the first year I've had a group that shifted before they left me. Which I should be doing every year, but, you know, rebuilding after COVID has been really, really difficult. So that's one of those goals that I really need to hit. I need to be bigger on scales. But I think just trying to Trying to my, I'm still, I think it's a mix of not being familiar enough with literature and orchestra and general still, know, going on year six in middle school, but two of those years were COVID years. So not sure how much those count. And knowing how to push my kids, they're going to be by grade level. They're not necessarily by ability. Like when I was in middle school, we had a top band, a top eight period, a top seventh, and then a mix. And I just have a grade seventh grade and then beginners, beginners can be any grade level, which at least is nice. So trying to be better about understanding where where they are at the end of the year and how to catch them back up in August, doing that a little bit faster, I think, having a stronger plan of restarting so that I can be in a better place by winter. alignment's been really tough for me and I know that that's like he said it's not what we're doing but I really do like to the high school directors what do you need my kids to do that way I know what I need to have them ready for because again it says things that like as somebody who grew up playing oboe and studied to teach band originally I don't like I said I don't know what I'm missing so those are those big clues that I'm really looking for what do you need out of them so I can hopefully I can try to have them ready. @16:28 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Right and mean that's that's a struggle even if you do know the content area because you know like middle schoolers or middle schoolers you know they're consistently inconsistent but like how far can you push them and you know you ask them on a Texas for like well I mean they could play Dionysia actually tried real hard but you know at the same time is that right for your community is that right for your skill set like not every community is going to support the kind of time investment you need to place from those pieces and operate at that level right away and so you know, even your specific situation, Ariana, of thinking about like, okay, the high school is doing something and they're not great about communicating that maybe. But even if they are, like knowing how to connect the pieces from where it gets hard or where they need to be in an area that's still little unfamiliar and COVID kind of took two good years out of maybe three, I don't know how liberal Virginia was at that point. In Texas, took two weeks, it's fine. Pretty much, yeah. But the fact that we are, you know, still digging out of that and they're still kind of rebuilding the program is both an opportunity but also kind of an albatross. It's like you have that weight on your back of having to get that thing done. But yeah, both of these kind of topics I think will fit really well into what we're talking about today. So the very first thing I like to think about getting back to the study of units and things like that is, you know, we have obvious things we need to do in performing arts. have concerts. We have we have, you know, kind of this milieu of stuff that ends up on our calendar and we work backwards from there because we really want to do well in those situations. And that's good. But often younger teachers can turn into like months of the week like, okay, what do we need to fix today? Rather than like, okay, we're working on this long term thing. So rather than units, I like to think about threads or strands that run through my year. Where for instance, know, the second band or the third band or, you know, really any ensemble, but I'm thinking, you know, an ensemble where skill development is still very much a you can tangibly see it improve. The thing I like to think about there is, okay, what are our fundamental skills? What are the things we're doing that I can connect across anything we're playing and how am I setting those up to be successful? So for instance, let's say I'm teaching that that in varsity middle school band. So we're, you know, looking at a grade two grade ones, I think is the minimum. and for triple C, right? Or grade one, grade two, is kind of where people end up. By the time I left, brings up where I ended up, and they've since improved dramatically from there, probably because I'm gone. But the thing that I thought about there always was, okay, so we're playing this music, great. And we play kind of the stuff we can play at beginning of the year, that's dance of the C scale, cheer one, pretty straightforward stuff. by the end of the year, we're doing stuff with maybe two independent motives. And, you know, like, great locomotive chase might be like the big thing. And now that's actually was a stretch for my kids, but that's neither here nor there. But using the skills that are required in those pieces, the very, very most basic skills, playing with a good sound, and with good articulation, playing with good line, playing with good musical thinking, now become threads that I just go, okay, where are we at on this scale in this piece? Because this piece is always gonna need to get better, and the skills always need to get better. But that skill is always going to be there. It applies to any piece we play. And so all of sudden, instead of going, how do I make this piece better, I go, how can I make this skill better that we'll make this piece better? So I kind of change the priority there. Which, again, we as experienced teachers do something like that probably more often than we don't. You know, if we have space in our schedule, or if it's acceptable in our area to do some sort of fundamental skill building section of our rehearsal, like, you know, daily drill down here in Texas, we work on stuff like that. That's a very intentional part of what we do. And I think in in string circles, generally, it's not something that happens as often, but the language is not foreign, which I think is really interesting. So, you know, one of the things they talk about is, you know, the beauty of sound, and how musical something is like, okay, that's great. But we got to do this all together and go, oh, And a lot of times, if you can walk them through why we're spending time playing, you know, on open note or working on bow control, or, you know, frog tip to frog, all that stuff, suddenly it becomes like, oh, I see what you're doing. This is, you know, this is a skill building. Great. Fine. Whatever. And, you know, there's lots of things to cover in there in terms of how that manifests and like using the metronome and stuff like that. But I think thinking about this idea of threads or strands that run through our year can be a really freeing thing in terms of what are we doing at a given day, but also how we look at the whole year. So, you know, it's that Christmas concert is Christmas concert or winter concert or whatever we want to call it. But it is a chance for us to work on specific skills that we know we need to be at a high level in later semester, like in spring semester for while or things like that or for contest or whatever it is. And then that's really the main focus. Music is the music. It's not a material that kids like that they really want, but like we can be a little bit more fun. free as long as it satisfies certain criteria we have for getting better at the things that we need to get better at. And that's up to us to decide. we'll talk that through in workshoping these ideas. But the other aspect that I think is really interesting is if you think about planting gardens, because everything's growing right now, because we're getting interested in constantly. And so like thinking about this idea of like if you look at like the countryside from the air, like not Texas, but like places where they actually grow lots of crops. You see kind of the squares or sometimes circles, but you see this very boxed out like this is sort of and this is wheat and this is corn. But then we also know because we've been in the woods, we've walked around that most of nature doesn't really grow that way. That's kind of something we impose as humans. And a lot of times they just grow wherever they kind of this like vines or if you want to think of like kudzu, like just kind of growing wherever it wants to, are teaching the things we have to teach to get the job done. to perform at the concert, to get the kids to audition, to do all the things. That's very much like the units or those crops. It's very like, here's Wordstarts, here's Wordstops. all this thing in between. But the ideas that we teach, the core of what it is to be musical in our ensembles, and I mean that to be income is everything, not just playing with that name, but like playing with a good sound and communicating musical information through some sort of group consensus, that's much more like a vine. That's much more like that kazoo, that just kind of grows wherever it wants to, and it can be a thread that connects everything, too. And so that, to me, is where it's good to start thinking about this, and even just re-articulating what we want to do in those new words can sometimes shake some things loose. So one of the things maybe I'd like to do is kind of take an aspect of what you're thinking about. Take one small slice, and see if you can apply something, like this would be a connecting thread that leads me back to. to August or September or whatever you start playing. So kind of take a second to think about that. So I'll share mine because it's not, I don't have the chance to teach an ensemble, which I wish I could, Cameron and David do a pretty darn good job. So I'm not really needed. But that said, I do think a lot about this in terms of I teach a two semester course. I teach like a junior high version and a high school version of how to be a band director. And this semester, how to be an orchestra director. And so a couple of the through ones I think about there, like the big one I'm thinking about now is critical thinking without calling it critical thinking. Like how do I get the students to listen to or recording or listen to performance and not just go, wow, needs to be louder or quieter. actually think deeper than dynamic changes or the way they may listen to a symphony concert and think down deeper of like okay what skills are they demonstrating they can do well? What are skills they are kind of like some kids are there and what are skills like nobody has a really good feel for and so they can start to then take that and go here are things that work here are things that need little attention here are things that are a five alarm firing we need to think about and that's the thread I'm trying to draw through everything so that I'm drawing their attention to that skill of assessing and thinking through student performance in as many different ways as I can without it becoming overwhelming so for like middle school classes for the musical focus classes we do a little bit with ensemble what we do a lot with like individual beginner sounds or individual instruction like you would in front of a homogenous beginner class which Ariana I know does not set them up to work outside of Texas but it's those are the cards we're dealt but like in the high school we do a lot more listening to ensembles and I have a collection of ensemble recordings. from not Texas. I won't say where they're from, but they're from not Texas. One, because that way they don't know. And two, ensemble, some of them are like, they can do the ensemble thing pretty well, but there are some very obvious gaps in the way they approach things, and that's, that's fine. That's where those groups come from. But then we transition to like the YouTube postings that people do of their pre YLs, and we pull up like Henry Middle School, like we pull up kind of your more standard, like here's a second band at a double C that's in a pretty far suburb of this major city. They suddenly have, I hope, a lot more tools to apply to that, that even though the ensemble sounds significantly better than what they're, they've been listening to, they still can go, oh, I hear that thing in a way that will unlock for them as a teacher the ability to go, oh, I hear that here's how I'm going to go about fixing it. So that's kind of how I'm thinking about threading in my microfilm and my course. What about y'all? @27:00 - Andrea T. Maher One of the, one of the big overlying threads for us is, you know, our kids start in fifth grade and we have schools that are fifth and sixth grade only and they only have, well it's Ted Regina's. They only have woodwind class, brass class, and percussion class. And they only get together for a concert so they may only have a couple of rehearsals before a performance. And so when they come to us, then they have the complete opposite. They have full van every day. They never break up until woodwinds brass or percussion unless we have sectionals. So our, so in a lot of ways we say we have to teach them how to do band because they don't know how to be in such a large group of students. They don't know how to react. They don't know how to rehearse in such a big setting of 65 kids and then teach the ensemble skills that they've never been taught. But at the same time, I still have to develop their individual skills. So it's a, that thread of teaching them how to be a band and to be a band member all the way through the year. is kind of a central idea for all our groups and how do you like what are some ways you kind of deploy that idea of like how to be a band uh some I mean basic we start off the years just like get to know your neighbor because they come from four different schools and so they all come together from and I'll think that some of them know each other some of them don't know anybody in the room so just get to know your section who sits next to you what's their name um and that starts us into we'll let's listen to your person next to your trio and then okay now you know their names like don't play louder than Joe Smith you know so kind of we do that first just getting them to know each other and stuff like that to kind of build that and then we can build from there but it's an interesting process it's very different you know than a lot of places that start their own beginners in sixth grade and and you know all the ways sixth grade one con rose kind of singular in that organization like @29:00 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Asadina does something similar to that, I think, where it's five, six, then a seven, eight. But again, the scale difference between Pasadena and Conro is pretty substantial, just in terms of the physical size of the district, to speak of the size of the programs. that idea of getting someone else's things and having to work with it, I think that's a really good thing to start with, though, is this idea of how do we work together as an ensemble? And one of the things that's come up in my research that's related to this, but not specifically about, like, pedagogy, that bands are some of the only organizations that are the size that they are, that are perpetually refreshing. like, choirs can get really big, but a lot of times if they're not a tattoo sent to the orchestra, they're gonna be a professional group, and then that's really about it. But, like, bands, especially when you look at bands the size of the ones we have here in Texas, they're six, eight groups that have three or four hundred kids in them. The only thing that they, that's not a band, because bands, like, this all over the world, but the only thing that's not that, that isn't a band that's that big is like a samba school in Brazil. A lot of other places, music is done at a much smaller scale, it's much more like maybe 10 to 12 people, or a game like 24 to 20 to 30, but still it's not hundreds of people that have to do the same together. So this idea of how do we operate as a social unit and how do we kind of react? I love that you said they don't know how to react because it might break up just seeing how middle schoolers react when they don't matter react, and that is every way under the sun, sometimes not in a helpful way, more often than not in a helpful way. And so like I love that you start with that and that's really cool. And it obviously shows up in what they do by the end of the year and what they do when they get to high school. So that's fantastic. Ariana, how about you? @30:51 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So I love that she brought that up because one of my goals as I grow the program is to eventually have, you know, sixth grade is what it is. And then I'm afraid to have a high strings and a low strings class and then eighth grade the ensemble group. that way they're kind of, I mean, I understand that yes, sixth grade is an ensemble, but not really. But that would give me that is something that I see the band directors here do is that, you know, they didn't get that time to address a lot of those like woodwind specific things because they were teaching an entire beginning band of one block. So they use seventh grade band to kind of help. They split to help make up for the deficiency. But my really strong point this year is was really funny that you mentioned it warm ups. Like that is what I'm really going after because that's been kind of a battle for me is like, I grew up on the blue book. I remember when I had to buy a new copy and I saw that one of the authors died I was reading the back I was like oh my god what like I still have my original copy from the Jackson middle school band in 1997. But I think I bought a euphonium copy for personally. And I was like, oh my gosh. And so to me, like, obviously out of the band game for quite a while, but like, you have to warm up. And I've noticed it was for orchestra that's very split. Some people are like, no, you just start playing whatever. And then like you had mentioned, there's a lot of technique work to be done. And again, as somebody who does not necessarily have those techniques or doesn't think about them because I wasn't taught them, I just had to learn them a week before my students. So I thought a cart was going to learn me, sorry. So I've been really struggling with that because so many people are like, oh, I just take it out of our music and I turn something into a warm up that day. I'm like, that's great. I don't have the mental capacity for that. I've got eight classes that I'm teaching, three different courses, plus three levels of orchestra, like, I can't do that. And so now I have a cart coming, There we go. So I've been looking at for a warm up book because then at that point we're like, I need somebody to tell me what to do. I was like, I just, I need, I don't need an idea. I just need it written out. And so that's something I'm looking to start this year. And I'm hoping will be that kind of kickstart refreshers just to really have, here's what we're going to do today. Here's how we remember how to do this and maybe tackle things that I didn't even think about that I'm always like, guys, we really got to work on using our whole boat there. What does that mean? Well, we know what that means, but have we done that in contact? Have I ever stopped to work on that? Have I started a class like that? Probably not, because it's all chaos. And so my brain, I feel like with that shift, because I shifted the COVID year, that was the year that we were, I was doing chorus and band, or chorus and orchestra at the same time. Two different classrooms, buildings. And then, you know, we will help for spring break and everything back. And so I don't think I ever fully got to like grasp how to start class, which feels so dumb saying that like that was like my ninth year teaching, I think eighth year teaching, like I should have known what I was doing at that point. But because it was something different and it was something that was really complex doing both at once, it just never clicked. And so I feel like I've almost failed my students in some ways because of that, because of my lack of knowledge, my kids can play rhythm all day long. They're great sight readers, they can play rhythm, they're fantastic, but they're missing some of that technique work. so I was just planning that you had mentioned that because that's really like what I'm looking to really attack this year is if I can start that, every day as we go from 80 minute classes to 50 minute classes now, they're still every other day, right? You know, what can I do that can make that 50 minutes now, so that 80 minutes, even more impactful. What can I do that's going to last even longer in a shorter amount of time? @35:05 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, and I mean, that's the, the ever other day is challenging. It's even more challenging when you have ever other day for what would be a normal class period, the 50 minutes rather than like an hour and a half or, you know, some other schools get. Um, so I mean, that, that in and of itself is challenging. And I wouldn't be too harsh on yourself. I think any of us who are teachers look back on our teaching of X years ago, well, I really didn't do the best for my students there. Like I could have been better and, you know, we're all where we are and we meet the challenges we meet with the tools we have. And as long as we're trying to get better tools, I think we're doing the right things. Um, so, so be gentle with yourself, especially, especially since you were spinning so many plates and then COVID added to the Luby's order, which that's a part. Um, they don't want to have the Luby's by UH though, just, just so everyone's gone. @35:58 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) It is gone. @35:59 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) It is gone. lot that who knows what will be built, hopefully something exciting or at least useful. So, but thinking about fundamental skills, about warm-ups and this idea and like, you grew up, you grew up in Texas, right? @36:15 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Yeah. @36:17 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) like, you you kind of know the the the Kool-Aid we don't bring down here about like what warm-up to and how they function. And being around U of H, like, we take it to a ridiculous extent sometimes. I still remember watching Tom Bennett rehearse the Wind Ensemble when they were preparing for TMA in 2005. And like, it was the first year player would play an interval up and an interval down within articulation and everybody else had to figure out what the articulation was, like what the rhythm was, but also what the intervals were and they weren't the same, it wasn't didn't mirror itself. So, like, yeah, we can we can go all day long and play some Sundays thinking about fundamentals at U of H and personally that is where my happiness lies, but at the same time that tool of thinking about fundamental skills. So like, this is where I think maybe it might be good not to wait on the high school people to tell you what they want. Instead, go, what does it look like they do? Like, what are some things that make sense there and just start with that as kind of a proximal goal? But then also, and I'll send you an email, I'll connect you to email area to our outgoing string person. ACTION ITEM: Connect Ariana with Aaron Hansen, a former U of H orchestra director, to discuss teaching orchestra outside of Texas - WATCH @37:22 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) She's moving up to Illinois. @37:25 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Her name's Aaron Hansen. She's got a lot of great information, especially about teaching not in Texas. @37:30 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Like, she's done in Michigan for a long time. That would be awesome, thank you. @37:33 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) That's probably a more supportive sort of setup than what you're describing. But at the same time, it's heterogeneous versus homogenous. It's not every day. you've got all these different things. And she's very sensitive to people who are not orchestra people operating in the orchestra space in terms of that they need a little bit more support. @37:53 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So I'll connect you to get email. @37:55 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) But to me, what you have the opportunity to do is one, make the warm up something that is going to build that skill, obviously, but to make it something where, especially as you mentioned, like, you've kind of got a bit of chaos, embrace the chaos a little bit, let it break little but give the kids jobs within that. And, you know, maybe you don't have a ton of great student leaders, but maybe you have a few and maybe make them, okay, you go in this corner, you go in this corner, have no idea how big your room is, but like, segment them out and go, okay, we're going to do the first three minutes is getting things together and setting ourselves up. then the next seven is going to be these three exercises, Bob, you're going to lead that one, Julie, going to lead that one, you know, SMA, going to lead that one. And you just have them do a little like round robin and all of sudden, don't have to work on the skill necessarily. You don't have to be directly responsible for they're doing, you're responsible for going around and monitoring and being like, how's how's that going? And then you can kind of bring them all back together. We're fine a little bit if you need to then move on to do the next thing and maybe maybe maybe like peak days where it's like Okay, it's Tuesday. We're gonna do this thing and Thursday. We'll do this or whatever your a day B day looks like Because that all the sudden empowers the kids to that gives them a little bit in what they're doing and We know that kids are like brutal with each other in terms of their evaluation of others They might not say it sometimes they do in middle school But they have years they can hear things and they can hear when things are right and when things are wrong and the more we empower them to Not just have those opinions, but do something with them. The more we start to build their internal musicianship. @39:38 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) I think right. @39:40 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I like them That and I mean play around with that like make it super simple at first make it like hold this note still for acts or like frog to tip Over eight counts at whatever tempo marking works or strings So like you know stuff that stuff that they can get easy wins, right? And then you can start moving in to technique and doing the things like here's how we shift the third position that we do this thing and then maybe even segment them by the three instrument families. If you're in trouble club go here, you're in altar club go here and if you're in place club go here and if you're a viola and can't read altar club just go cry because that's really all you can do. @40:19 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Or you're me. @40:22 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I moveable clefs make me, I taught high school in the bassoon or trombone A2 to go into this I'd write letters then. I was ashamed. @40:32 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) They laugh at me. I'm like okay hang on CB. Okay this is an E or usually it's like the violin two-line. It's a little weird. But I will say something that's like a happy accident that I discovered I got a doctor beat last year. probably one of the only orchestra people with one but you know it's okay and accidentally switching it to like the beats not like not the straight quarters but you know it has like those rhythms that it'll play. Oh yeah. Yeah. And so, like, I would actually do that. Sometimes I'd be like, all right, do scale, let's go. And just doing their scales to whatever, you know, popped up on the Dr. B and they're like, Oh, okay, I can do this. I can do this. @41:14 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Evan, if you can find the tempo, and this is probably something you can do if it's like music that is danceable, look for the BPM and get a karaoke track of like something that's popular, this school of program, which that makes it hard. But like, hot to go, maybe is not what you want to do with them, but things like that. And put that as the backing track for playing scales. If you're worried about just technique and all you want to do is focus on that. when you're focused on quality of sound, take that away and go, okay, let's do this half tempo and really focus on it, feeling the same. But the sound being the thing we're doing and then speed it back up and do that thing. But like, I mean, the fact that you have a Dr. B means that your kids are probably a lot more accurate in ensemble settings than others because they're more aware of that thing. @41:58 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Right, because they hear it a lot. They're like, can you turn it off? @42:02 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) No. @42:02 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Not yet. No, not. @42:04 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) No, no. But I mean, and that's another thing too, though, like, and this is something we talk about in my undergraduate classes, but it's something I've talked about for a long time, because not being in Texas, I had to defend the metronome a lot. I had to be like, this is why we use it, and this is what we do with it, because people out, you know, in the broader world, and you've experienced it. know right now, maybe you have to, Andrea, the Texas is a musical conversation or the kids are robots conversation often centers back to what you have that metronome going the entire time. It's like, okay, you know what, if we're using the metronome 100% of the rehearsal and it's the day before the concert, yeah, we screwed up as teachers, right? But how else are the kids going to learn steady time, except through a metronome? Not to say anything of playing together as a group or understanding subdivisions of the beat, steady time does not something that we as humans do very well, just cool as a crowd clap when the fight song happens at a football game, like it's everywhere. And so, you know, thinking about that, though, the thing that that kind of has come to my mind is that, like, the, the metronome is a scaffold. If we want to think about educational terminology, or I also, we're just training wheels. You you need them for a while. And, and at some point, with the metronome, it's not training wheels because you need it to kind of give you a reference, but then it goes away. @43:21 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) You don't need it as much. @43:22 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) so, we as teachers need to have a plan for okay, here's not just how we're going to take out the metronome, like it's marching band. Like, okay, here's the first movement, no metronome. it's going to be, here's how I want to build their skill with the metronome, so that it's not that they don't need it. that it's already inside of them and they don't have function without the audible click-track thing. And, you know, I think that is something that maybe, I know I lost sight of as band director sometimes, when I was teaching, especially teaching the lower skill level groups, the groups that kind of need a little bit more loving care and the ones that maybe don't necessarily want to practice all the time. Um, you know, like it's a temptation turn a metronome and go and the more I didn't do that, more I was very intentional about when we took it away and making them do things on their own, like training wheels, the stronger those kids got. Sometimes they would, you know, jump up to the first band, sometimes they'd jump up to the second band, but we always started every semester with a conversation of, okay, this is the concert band and we have two other bands and you have to audition into those. My goal here is that you're not in this band next semester. You're not in this band next year. I want to see you move up. I want to see you have those experiences too. And you know, I would say probably 60% of them did, which for a community like Waller, where we didn't have access to a lot of private lesson teachers was not a bad thing and the band's got better. So, but this idea that you mentioned, Ariana, of thinking about like the metronome is kind of being a weird thing. I sparked that because again, that's another thread that we can pull on, of how to play as an ensemble because it's a related skill, but it's a different skill than playing by ourselves. And I think that's something maybe to keep in mind to, given both of you or middle school teachers, and it's something that's present in your mind, because you know, these kids don't know what they don't know when it comes to being in an ensemble. know they're sitting next to somebody, but what to do with that information is not intuitive. It's very much a learned process. ACTION ITEM: Implement new activities like fundamental technique exercises, circle orchestra, and scrambled seating to address skill gaps, boost technique, and improve morale and engagement. - WATCH And so kudos for both of you for kind of making that a priority early in your year. @45:23 - Andrea T. Maher Well, I think Ariana, I think you have more to draw than you in of like organizing your class. think, you know, you can still like steal from the band world where, you know, we do like 10 minutes of warm up, 10 minutes of technique, and then the rest music or some version of that. And you did that all your band life. And I think you can bring that to your orchestra class or if you ever had to do choir again, you can still use that same organization to your time. @45:54 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) And I think you have more skills than you give yourself credit for. Yeah, it's actually when in terms of how to structure the learning and I think that's that's a really key thing that we all need to embrace when we run into situations that are maybe novel. @46:12 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Well, thank you. Yeah, I think I let myself get overwhelmed a couple of years ago. Since I was just taking my beginners to assessment and I've refused. Which is a different conversation. But so we had a clinician come in instead and she was like first thing like you are an orchestra person. Stop saying you're a band person. was like, yes, ma'am. She's like, you are doing so many things. Well, and I think I just kind of. Because I'm such a perfectionist probably coming out of a Texas band program, you know, like. I had to be a perfectionist. There was no choice. There was there was no option. And so I think I kind of let myself get mentally overwhelmed with, like I said, what I don't know. Instead of being like, I do know how. to do this part of it, let's go. And while we're doing that part, let me fill in the gaps that I don't know and add it, you know. @47:07 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So I think we're all that place. Imposter syndrome is not something that only the other person has in the conversation. I can promise you that it is we are all dealing with variants of that. And I think you set this up really well, Ariana, because the kind of next thing on my list of things to talk about was this idea that was kind of made me like squint my eyes and have to really think for little bit, but then it's like, oh, okay, is that within all of this, when we're talking about instructional design and like where things happen and how to connect with pieces, there is a difference between teaching and learning. Because if we think about what a good classroom looks like, like you mentioned Ariana, this kind of chaos, like when we think of the ideal classroom, we're often thinking about it's quiet because they're attentive, they're making I contact their engage with something. And all those are kind of external markers of learning. But we also know for experience that those are always not internal. We're reflected internally. You know, even if they're like doing the thing, it's like they might be thinking about who knows what. probably don't want to know what they're thinking about especially in middle school. But this idea that there is a difference, they're related. And we often think one leads to the next without really having to, you know, make any further steps. But there is a difference between us teaching and the students learning. And sometimes that difference is in the way that they interact with the material. So for instance, you know, one of the things we know is that the learning modalities, the visuals and oral and kinesthetic learners is kind of not 100% accurate. Like it's everybody's got, you know, variations of that. It's not quite as clear cut as they made it back when they talked about that. But the way students tend to learn best in. and arts settings, especially performing arts, is by doing things. And so the repetition count is high. But then we go, well, what if they're doing it wrong? we're repeating mistakes, basically. so building a way that we can do the teaching, but then have a really, really, really, really, really short window or short time span before we can start assessing is the learning happening. Because the only way we know learning is happening is by what they demonstrate. And the only way we know that really robust learning is happening, really stuff that's going to last beyond that day is having them do it when they don't think about it directly. Like, they're just kind of the natural fallback. Like, we think about a kid, and you see that kid pick their instrument. And you can tell before they make a sound, kind of where they're out on their journey. Like, if they're, like, of pointing everywhere and they're a mess and they can't sit still, you kind of don't expect them to come in and sound like Chris Martin. But they pick up their trumpet. It's very intentional. And they set themselves up, if they make a sound that's more like Chris Martin, you're going to be a lot less surprised. And so that idea of the learning being their demonstration of the skill away from the kind of us like looking at them daggers in our eyes is a thing that we want to try and get to as quickly as possible, I think, as far as being teachers. And so, you know, assessment piece, we always do formative assessment, we're always listening to kids. But then when we have them, this kind of gets to what we're talking about with you, Ariana, is, you know, when they do things, whether it's really isolated skills or application, both skills to something in technique or application of all that music, how often are we letting them go, do the thing, try different ways, kind of learn like, you know, pre-ranked chickens, and then come back together to see if the skill got better, like, how often are we doing that? the answer is not often at all, maybe explore that, because that might be a way one, the kids get a problem. break. You know, they only want to listen to us for so long. But two, it gives them a little bit more freedom at a time in which middle schoolers love. They love to feel like big kid. mean, an eight-year-old who might as well be in middle school because she likes to feel like a big kid so much. And all of that stuff suddenly becomes less about the classroom looking a certain way and more about the actual product we get because of the way we let our classroom operate. I mean, does that like scare you this thing? Because it scared me when I first ran, like, I don't know if I am willing to give up that kind of control to the kids. Or does it strike you as like, oh, already do something like that. @51:43 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) This is what it is. Go ahead, Ariana. Sorry. Oh, I was going to say I do every now and then I'll do stuff like that. Or maybe as an ensemble, try something one way and then we'll try another way and another way and we'll kind of like let the class come to a consensus about it. But I've never- usually if I let them scatter to work on something, it just ends up being social hour. So I kind of give up on that. So I don't know if I need to be more directed, if I need to move around more when that happens, because I like the idea, which is why I keep trying it. It just doesn't typically work in my setting, which means I'm not setting it up correctly. @52:25 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Well, or it's just there are certain challenges you might face given the kids you have in that room. @52:33 - Andrea T. Maher Well, and like I've done this this was the first shoot that I've kind of done this. You know, we play through a scale and it sounds terrible as a full band. So I'll say practice that on your own for like 15 seconds and we're gonna try it again. I like practice on your own. And they do. They sit because I only give them 10 or 15 seconds and they'll practice that scale and we'll play it again and it'll be maybe this much better. But it did get a little better or sometimes if we go through a technical passage and eat. and that we're playing a real slow. I'll just let them practice on their own, but only like 10 or 15 seconds, because any more than that, then you might get Careless Whisper or the Haysong or something like that. So I've done that. I probably did it a little more than I probably should have this year, but like you said, it gives the kids a break. And they're gonna do it anyway. You know, if we play a scale and it's terrible, they want to play it on their own. And they'll try it. So like, oh, we're just gonna buy into it. And so we did that a few times and it seemed to work because I did it only for a short amount of time. Today I was in a clinic and they said something like, like Ariana, you were saying like, sometimes when you have kind of a crazy day, the David Puckett and Richard Alvarado said, embrace it and make that the one day you have, you know, sit by your friend day and everybody scatters and sits in a different place in your orchestra room. and we do circle orchestra. Everybody makes the big giant circle and play. he said, you know, that one day, you know, the kids will remember the fun of that one day and it'll, it'll pay you more dividends in morale because you embraced the chaos and you just went with it that one day. And, you know, he's like, make it better. @54:21 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You may not, but the kids will remember when they did circle orchestra or when they got to sit by their friends. @54:27 - Andrea T. Maher And so sometimes if it's too chaotic, like just immersive. @54:31 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) That is actually something like all throw timers. I use classroom screen a lot. @54:36 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) don't know you know that. @54:38 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) But since we're supposed to have our learning targets posted, then I didn't have like a rotating set of things or I'll have that on one screen, classroom screen on the other. But I'll set like 15 minute timers. Okay, we have 15 minutes for this piece. Find a new place to sit, go and we'll rehearse for 15 minutes. We'll, you know, address whatever new issues pop up because suddenly we're not coming with our section. And we can't hear that part. so, oh, it didn't go right. Let's talk about that. OK, minutes is up. Next piece by Denise Clothosico. And that's something that the kids really, really do like. So yes, I do love the whole historical playing or the scrambled seating. @55:15 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) That's all I've been And I think that gets us something that one of our graduate students who does a lot of presenting talks about where it's not so much about the pedagogy of what you're teaching and the technique. It's more about paying into the relationship bank with the kids as an ensemble. I see you. It's a crazy day. You're in middle school. You're crazy to begin with. Let's lean into that today. As long as we get some very basic things done, we're good. And I will make this as fun as possible. But then tomorrow, you have to come in and we're back to kind of doing things a different way. And so that it's not always the same flavor of ice cream. So I love that too. And one of the things I always did was talk about, OK, want you to do this five times. Five times. And then put your instrument up. And when everyone's instrument is down, I know we're ready to go, and you know, social pressure works on that, but they even within us, okay, in those five times, what were some different ways you did work on that thing? techniques, what strategies did you use? And like, I taught high school kids for the majority of my career, so you could talk about things in that kind of abstract way, but even like with little kids like, hey, did you play or working on scales? Did you play the mini scales? Did you play mini scale? Like the first five notes, and then the next five notes, and then put those two things together, like the two added monster on Sesame Street, and some of them are like, no, I don't need that, but some of them like, oh, oh, I forgot about that. That was in sixth grade. Oh yeah, and all of sudden they have this tool that they're going to use again, or hey, did you play that at Hack Tempo, or did you play that like in, you know, for the kids to get really bored, the ADD talented kids like, did you swing that? Did you, you know, did you play it like little two note groups and do your thing or, you know, whatever it is, or like the kids like, I played the the Arbon A2, or I played the Clark Study, so I gave you that. I'm glad you did that. You know, because then all of sudden, it's not just repetition for the kids that are paying attention. It's, oh, there are ways I can practice this that make the practicing improve me faster, you know, rather than just play it five times. And then we're done. It's like, well, it's going to get a little bit better. You get better doing the thing. But the more we can build these awarenesses in, like, oh, if I'm having trouble with this kind of thing, here are some tools I have. And not every kid's going to remember all of them, but if they're exposed to them, they stand a better chance than if we don't talk about them at all. And they're probably not learning them anywhere else. And so, like, to me, that becomes a really valuable part of, again, if we're talking about building skills over time, how do I approach this as an individual musician? And how do I bring that to the ensemble? I mean, that's level one level two listening within what Mr. talks about, but he's not the only one that talked about that. He just gave it names. So we tend to point to him first. But within all of that, too, I think that the way we think about ensemble. in terms of an individual's contribution to it, frames a lot of that. If it's, that's got to sound better and we don't talk to the individual, all of a sudden we're reinforcing, well, part might or might not matter and if I get it right fine, but as long as it sounds good overall, gonna be all right rather than, hey, we need everybody to be on the same level here. go practice that, be able to play it perfectly twice and then put your instrument down and like make it something they can do. But yeah, I definitely agree with Andrea that the time aspect of it is like, okay, you can do that for this many seconds or you can do that for this many reps and then put your instrument down is a good place to start to kind of keep the pulse of class going in. sometimes too, they don't need to leave their seats to do that. They can just be like, okay, here's, stop. seconds, which at that on your own or do that twice and then we'll come back and just leave them sitting in their seats. But sometimes that, you know, scramble seating, it looks like, you know, the rice mob doing a marching band show is exactly what they need. And it just depends, you gotta read the kids and read the room. But to me, to kind of close this out, this idea of connecting fall to spring is kind of something we talk about more at band, and especially in high school band, because there is a pretty clear divide sometimes between the way we approach marching band and the way we approach sit-down band, which I've never subscribed to, but I've known some people too. But to me, what this kind of points out, what these conversations point out, is that the things we tend to think of, like Andrea being in the six-day honor band room, where people are playing crazy literature at really high level, it's just mind blowing. It kind of makes you want to just hang it up and be like, okay, I'm never gonna do that, so we're done. Well, that would be me, because I don't teach on solos anymore. But within that, that's a secondary marker of achievement to me in a given year. Like that, it's almost like, how will those kids play a fundamental skills and ensemble is the primary marker of their learning? Like, how we play, you know, the... we play one or how we play this exercise that combines, you know, like a scalar thing with articulation and range and all that, like how we can make that sound as an ensemble, that's a primary marker because that shows up in the literature and it shows up at a much, much higher level maybe because there's fewer people doing it. But if everyone can do it at a really high level, we know that they have the skills and it's just a matter of getting their brains around how to do that in that setting. And so to me, this idea of creating threads and connections through the year is way less about how the literature lines up. think it's going to because that's the way we think and it should because that is helpful to the students, but it's more about how the fundamental skills develop over time. And we're working where we are working on those and I'm going to show up in the music or pulling them from the music and we see a consistent kind of group of them moving across the year. All of a sudden, we're achieving both the primary and the secondary improvement matrices if we want to think about that way. But another way to think about it too, that we kind of touched on a little bit is it's more about their personal accountability and how they do things, how students approach their instrument individually, but also then in the ensemble. That's a primary marker of learning, like how when they pick up their instrument, what do they do and how do they approach problems? How do they solve the problems before we as the teacher need to go and solve them for them? And given that so many of our kids come from either helicopter parents or what's the new one bulldozer parents or snow plow parents or there's all sorts of parenting that involves destroying the thing in front of your kids so they don't have to face challenges, we know that that's something they're going to need because the real world doesn't have that. You know, your mom and dad aren't going to bring you your briefcase at the job interview because you forgot at home, at least I hope they're not. So, you know, this idea of how they approach things kind of as an add-on benefit of, okay, if we expect these things out of them, over time they're going to grow into them. It's just up to us to be one patient but also realistic of, am I doing enough? And the answer's probably going to be, no, I can always do more. We always think that way because... these humans are really good at identifying problems, especially musicians. There's actually research out that says our self-efficacy, our thought process about how well we do things, he's in the gutter, absolutely in the bottom of the dumpster compared to everybody else, musicians in general. We have terrible, terrible mental health, which we as musicians go, well, yeah, that makes sense, but it's not just us, it's all musicians. So we at least have that going for us. And so to me, this idea of one patient on our part, also building these skills and students, that's a way to combat that. That's way to go, no, you have this power to do this thing. By the time you get done here, you don't need me anymore. You've got all the tools and you know how to do the thing. when a kid graduates from the Clean High School or graduates from the Woodlands High School or graduates from any high school, the goal there to me as a teacher should be that they can operate completely independently of their music program and still be a functional musician in an ensemble context. And maybe the Americans sound the best for the context that they show, but at Mediachi, they might not really know what they're doing, but they have the tools to go, oh, I hear that thing, so I'm going to imitate it. I know how this works in an ensemble, but I'm going to do these things, at least as a place to start. And to me, if we're doing that as teachers, on top of keeping them excited about music and giving them a place to experience the emotional release and all the cool things that happen in there and keeping them wanting to do that after they leave high school and after they leave college, I think we're doing a very good job. But part of that comes down to, what are the threads that we connect across that academic year and how do we grow those from year to year with our kids, especially if we see them in different ensembles every year? All of sudden then it becomes something where it's like, okay, here's what this level of the game looks like. This is sixth grade, here's seventh grade, it's this level, it's harder room. The sun is trying to kill you like it does in Mario. And then this over here, and all of a sudden we have these manufactured and these systemic levels. That we can just play within and see what works for our kids to get them to the places we want them to get to so I mean to me that is That kind of thought process is a lot more freeing than I got to do this piece by Maine It's got to be perfect and it's got it so all the sudden I have little bit more one freedom to explore things But to the the focus is not how can I make you know this piece? Sound amazing the focus is how do I make the ensemble sound amazing? While doing this piece like how do I give them the skills to sound amazing that we can raft onto this piece or whatever piece We put in front of them and I mean that's that's part of how mr. got his kids to play music for Prague in 1970 Because it was written two years before There are still some colleges that can't get through that piece and yet his middle schoolers did all that being said I know it's what partially it's the magic of it being green All of us wish we had in all this trying foster when we see it in ourselves But I don't want to hold you guys long because I know we went over last time, but did you guys get the materials that I sent out, like the summary recap and all that, okay, good. You'll be getting another one of those in the morning, and this tab and thing is way more powerful than I thought it was going be. So it does some really cool things. So I'm going to see if I can boost those up to and how I share stuff and how I'm documenting things. I'm learning the tool and I think it's really cool, and I'm going see if I can pay for it for me. We'll see. @1:05:32 - Andrea T. Maher I'm not holding my breath, but... @1:05:34 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) All right. Well, thank you guys so much, and I hope you have a great rest of your evening, and I will see you next week.",

The focus shifted from disconnected units based solely on performance literature to overarching \"threads\" or \"strands\" of fundamental musical skills that span the entire year. This approach emphasizes active learning, with students demonstrating skills through application rather than passive instruction. To build student ownership and accountability, strategies such as short individual practice times during rehearsals, student-led warm-ups, and scrambled seating arrangements were proposed. The goal is to develop students' problem-solving abilities and musical independence. Implementation ideas include identifying core skill threads (like tone, articulation, and ensemble playing) that apply across all literature, incorporating structured \"chaos\" to boost engagement, using short timed practice sessions, and having students explain their practice strategies. By framing ensemble improvement in terms of individual contributions and accountability, educators aim to create a curriculum that goes beyond performance obligations, fosters musical independence, and prepares students to be mature, skilled performers after graduating. The key to this approach is consistently revisiting fundamental skills across all literature while gradually empowering students to take ownership of their musical development, providing flexibility in repertoire selection while systematically building transferable core abilities. Key Takeaways * Instead of teaching in disconnected units based solely on performance literature, the group discussed having overarching \"threads\" or \"strands\" of fundamental musical skills (tone, articulation, ensemble playing, etc.) that span the entire academic year. * These skill threads would be revisited consistently across any literature studied, providing a cohesive focus beyond just performance obligations. * There was an emphasis on students actively demonstrating learning through the application of skills, not just being taught techniques by the teacher. * Strategies were explored for giving students ownership, such as short individual practice times, having them lead warmups, scrambling seating, etc. This builds personal accountability. * The group highlighted the difference between teaching techniques and actual learning when students can independently apply those techniques. * A key goal was developing students' problem-solving ability as musicians, preparing them for independence after graduating from the music program. Topics Curriculum Threads/Strands The traditional approach of teaching disconnected units based on performance literature was challenged. Instead, the group advocated for identifying overarching \"threads\" or \"strands\" of fundamental musical skills that could connect all the literature studied throughout the year. These fundamental skills, such as tone production, articulation, ensemble playing, sight-reading, etc., apply to any piece of music. By consistently revisiting and developing these skills across all literature, students would build a strong musical foundation rather than just preparing separate concert programs. This thread-based approach provides more flexibility in choosing literature while systematically developing core abilities that transfer to any music. It gives the curriculum a cohesive focus beyond just performance obligations. Application of Learning Simply teaching techniques is not enough - students must have opportunities to actively apply those skills individually, away from the teacher's observation. This independent application demonstrates true learning has occurred beyond just being taught. Strategies were discussed for facilitating this, such as: * Giving students short individual practice times during rehearsals to work on skills * Having students lead warmup exercises * Scrambling the ensemble's seating to create new listening environments This helps build students' personal accountability as musicians and problem-solving abilities since the teacher is not constantly watching over them. Challenges in Connecting Fall/Spring The educators shared the challenges they face in trying to connect the fall and spring semesters cohesively: * Andrea (who is planning to submit for honor band) has to balance preparing very difficult UIL contest literature for the spring while still making time for more engaging/fun music for concerts. * Ariana, coming from a band background, sometimes struggles to identify which fundamental string technique skills to prioritize teaching her orchestra students. * The constant demands of performances can make it difficult to maintain a consistent focus on skill development throughout the year. Embracing Structured \"Chaos\" While rehearsals need structure, the group discussed the value of occasionally embracing productive \"chaos\" or freedom for students. This helps build relationships and empowers them to take ownership. Strategies included: * Doing scrambled seating like a circle orchestra for a change of perspective * Using timers to give short bursts of individual practice time during rehearsals * Suggesting different practice strategies besides just straight repetition * Allowing these less-structured environments gives students a break from constant teaching while still reinforcing skills. Next Steps Some key next steps were identified: * Ariana will connect with an outgoing string faculty member for advice on fundamental technique skills to prioritize teaching orchestra students. * Both will explore warm-up books and other resources for systematic technique development. * They will implement short individual practice times within rehearsals, guiding students to use specific strategies. * Moments of structured \"chaos,\" like circle seating, will be built into rehearsal plans to empower students. The goal is to develop independent, problem-solving musicians who can apply their skills beyond following the teacher's instructions. It is crucial to connect the fall and spring with consistent skill development threads. Transcript @7:15 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) But okay, done tap dancing. I think we've got everybody here that's going to be here today. So um, but what I was going to offer is, you know, I wasn't super happy with the quads that you got tried to get through on Tuesday and then like we ran out and time we ran over. So I changed the script a little bit today. There's not going to be a power point. going to be much more of a discussion based session in Ariana. know you probably doing bedtime kid things or dealing with kids at bedtime. @7:47 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) I'm actually on my walk because I haven't gotten to do that yet today. @7:52 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay, well, excellent. Well, feel free to chime in whenever. We are we're talking and you know, thing I wanted to talk about today. @8:00 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So @8:00 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) That again, I'm sorry. @8:00 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Were y'all talking about honor band? @8:03 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, we're just kind of doing the blow by blow Dawson high school one. @8:07 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) OK, in six, which, wow. @8:10 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, I mean, Aaron's going to have a year because he's doing Midwest. He's doing honor band. They're going to make state marching contest because of the area they're in. So he's going to need a bit of a sabbatical. @8:22 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) I think he should just take April and and may off and just kind of do his own thing. @8:27 - Andrea T. Maher Crazy. OK, cool. @8:30 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So yeah, it's a good time down here in Texas. @8:34 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Sounds like it. @8:35 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Um, but today what I wanted to talk about is kind of something I know we all do. I know we're all familiar with how this works. And so rather than be like, here's this new idea, I wanted to kind of talk through some of ways I think about it and then actually have a chance to kind of workshop some ideas and see what we think about this, this idea of curriculum as something that's not boring. Um, I don't know. if you're, when you came into the profession, if the vertical alignment thing was still a thing in professional development, I know when I started teaching in Keller and O2, that was like the thing you did in fine arts PD, if you weren't, if you actually got fine arts PD, you did vertical alignment between your middle school and high school and make sure everything all lines up, and it's not that, it's not what we're talking about today. That's so important, it's very tedious and has a lot of value, but is, again, tedious and not for doing things over Zoom. There's no refreshing about that. But the thing that keeps on coming to mind for me, and this has been something that's kind of rattled around my brain a lot and finally landed on something that I think I can call it a, like give it a name. And that is this idea of, we often think in units when we're teaching, like I have to do this thing till this date. And then I do this thing until this date. then we just kind of like look at all our performance obligations and auditions and things and work backwards, which is great because that lets us plan out a year. But there are things we miss if that's the only way we look at it. And it's unlikely that any one of us on this call only look at it that way, but there's a temptation, especially for younger teachers to look at it that way. And so, what I wanted to do is talk about kind of ways to think through the year or ways that I've thought of to think of through the year that might help one give y'all who are experiencing teachers more tools, but two younger teachers, they can get kind of caught in that getting slapped in the face every two weeks with something I need to do. This kind of gives them a thread to hang on to that at least in the midst of that, which is just part of a new job, they can still make forward progress on areas within what they want to cover. But before we get into that too deeply, but think about that. What are some things that come to mind for you about challenges that crop up when you're trying to maintain some sort of cohesive through line or some kind of central focus to your curriculum through an academic year? What are some things that are challenging about deploying the curriculum you want throughout your, you know, your hundred and eighty days in front of the kids? @11:30 - Andrea T. Maher Well, for me, this upcoming year is a triple C honor band year. And so, you know, I've already I've already been in contact with my clinician since May already looking at what's going to be our UIL program, whatever some possibilities, and then backtracking from there, like, okay, if I'm going to play this, what am I going to play at Christmas to help build skills into that? And to me, I mean, it's really great the way that works, but the downs side of that is there's no spring concert with like fun movie music and pop tunes and the end of the year like the musical reward for all this hard work like we go straight all the way to mid May 11th 15th with the same music the whole spring semester and and that's what we do but at the same time all the rest of the bands get to do the fun stuff the fun music and to make this hard lit this hard uil lit fun for the kids and fresh all the way from December one to the end of the year is is a challenge yeah I can imagine and you know with with that too like it's you can kind of paint it as like okay you're the top ensemble this is a cool thing we get to do nobody else has access to but it can be a grind I'm sure like what are you thinking through your program like what are some Considerations you have for what you're gonna play for that There's a piece called Helios on the great four lists that we're looking at and then we're trying to figure out What to put with it? We're actually gonna look at a grade three and see like maybe the old red mill or variations on Scarborough fair or something like that because in the past I've done a great five and and this year two really hard grade fours and It wasn't as successful as it needed to have men or should have been so You know trying to find that fine line of a program that's competitive, but also Really really good. It's got to be amazing. @13:44 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So It's a challenge Yeah, that would be a challenge and you know I think one of the things the honor band process does do like you said is it creates this kind of runway for you because you have to think back Through okay, this is the spring what I'm doing in the in the fall and have and that actually ties really well into what we're talking about today. But that's not to say that playing the same three pieces for an entire semester is not a stream on everyone, including the teacher. @14:13 - Andrea T. Maher So what about Ariana? Like, I'd be curious what your answer is being in Virginia. Like, what is that for you? @14:23 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So, for me, my big struggle, think, is that orchestra still isn't really my home base. So, sometimes they don't really know what I'm missing. If that makes sense, I don't know what are things that I should have done by now. last year, this past year was the first year I've had a group that shifted before they left me. Which I should be doing every year, but, you know, rebuilding after COVID has been really, really difficult. So that's one of those goals that I really need to hit. I need to be bigger on scales. But I think just trying to Trying to my, I'm still, I think it's a mix of not being familiar enough with literature and orchestra and general still, know, going on year six in middle school, but two of those years were COVID years. So not sure how much those count. And knowing how to push my kids, they're going to be by grade level. They're not necessarily by ability. Like when I was in middle school, we had a top band, a top eight period, a top seventh, and then a mix. And I just have a grade seventh grade and then beginners, beginners can be any grade level, which at least is nice. So trying to be better about understanding where where they are at the end of the year and how to catch them back up in August, doing that a little bit faster, I think, having a stronger plan of restarting so that I can be in a better place by winter. alignment's been really tough for me and I know that that's like he said it's not what we're doing but I really do like to the high school directors what do you need my kids to do that way I know what I need to have them ready for because again it says things that like as somebody who grew up playing oboe and studied to teach band originally I don't like I said I don't know what I'm missing so those are those big clues that I'm really looking for what do you need out of them so I can hopefully I can try to have them ready. @16:28 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Right and mean that's that's a struggle even if you do know the content area because you know like middle schoolers or middle schoolers you know they're consistently inconsistent but like how far can you push them and you know you ask them on a Texas for like well I mean they could play Dionysia actually tried real hard but you know at the same time is that right for your community is that right for your skill set like not every community is going to support the kind of time investment you need to place from those pieces and operate at that level right away and so you know, even your specific situation, Ariana, of thinking about like, okay, the high school is doing something and they're not great about communicating that maybe. But even if they are, like knowing how to connect the pieces from where it gets hard or where they need to be in an area that's still little unfamiliar and COVID kind of took two good years out of maybe three, I don't know how liberal Virginia was at that point. In Texas, took two weeks, it's fine. Pretty much, yeah. But the fact that we are, you know, still digging out of that and they're still kind of rebuilding the program is both an opportunity but also kind of an albatross. It's like you have that weight on your back of having to get that thing done. But yeah, both of these kind of topics I think will fit really well into what we're talking about today. So the very first thing I like to think about getting back to the study of units and things like that is, you know, we have obvious things we need to do in performing arts. have concerts. We have we have, you know, kind of this milieu of stuff that ends up on our calendar and we work backwards from there because we really want to do well in those situations. And that's good. But often younger teachers can turn into like months of the week like, okay, what do we need to fix today? Rather than like, okay, we're working on this long term thing. So rather than units, I like to think about threads or strands that run through my year. Where for instance, know, the second band or the third band or, you know, really any ensemble, but I'm thinking, you know, an ensemble where skill development is still very much a you can tangibly see it improve. The thing I like to think about there is, okay, what are our fundamental skills? What are the things we're doing that I can connect across anything we're playing and how am I setting those up to be successful? So for instance, let's say I'm teaching that that in varsity middle school band. So we're, you know, looking at a grade two grade ones, I think is the minimum. and for triple C, right? Or grade one, grade two, is kind of where people end up. By the time I left, brings up where I ended up, and they've since improved dramatically from there, probably because I'm gone. But the thing that I thought about there always was, okay, so we're playing this music, great. And we play kind of the stuff we can play at beginning of the year, that's dance of the C scale, cheer one, pretty straightforward stuff. by the end of the year, we're doing stuff with maybe two independent motives. And, you know, like, great locomotive chase might be like the big thing. And now that's actually was a stretch for my kids, but that's neither here nor there. But using the skills that are required in those pieces, the very, very most basic skills, playing with a good sound, and with good articulation, playing with good line, playing with good musical thinking, now become threads that I just go, okay, where are we at on this scale in this piece? Because this piece is always gonna need to get better, and the skills always need to get better. But that skill is always going to be there. It applies to any piece we play. And so all of sudden, instead of going, how do I make this piece better, I go, how can I make this skill better that we'll make this piece better? So I kind of change the priority there. Which, again, we as experienced teachers do something like that probably more often than we don't. You know, if we have space in our schedule, or if it's acceptable in our area to do some sort of fundamental skill building section of our rehearsal, like, you know, daily drill down here in Texas, we work on stuff like that. That's a very intentional part of what we do. And I think in in string circles, generally, it's not something that happens as often, but the language is not foreign, which I think is really interesting. So, you know, one of the things they talk about is, you know, the beauty of sound, and how musical something is like, okay, that's great. But we got to do this all together and go, oh, And a lot of times, if you can walk them through why we're spending time playing, you know, on open note or working on bow control, or, you know, frog tip to frog, all that stuff, suddenly it becomes like, oh, I see what you're doing. This is, you know, this is a skill building. Great. Fine. Whatever. And, you know, there's lots of things to cover in there in terms of how that manifests and like using the metronome and stuff like that. But I think thinking about this idea of threads or strands that run through our year can be a really freeing thing in terms of what are we doing at a given day, but also how we look at the whole year. So, you know, it's that Christmas concert is Christmas concert or winter concert or whatever we want to call it. But it is a chance for us to work on specific skills that we know we need to be at a high level in later semester, like in spring semester for while or things like that or for contest or whatever it is. And then that's really the main focus. Music is the music. It's not a material that kids like that they really want, but like we can be a little bit more fun. free as long as it satisfies certain criteria we have for getting better at the things that we need to get better at. And that's up to us to decide. we'll talk that through in workshoping these ideas. But the other aspect that I think is really interesting is if you think about planting gardens, because everything's growing right now, because we're getting interested in constantly. And so like thinking about this idea of like if you look at like the countryside from the air, like not Texas, but like places where they actually grow lots of crops. You see kind of the squares or sometimes circles, but you see this very boxed out like this is sort of and this is wheat and this is corn. But then we also know because we've been in the woods, we've walked around that most of nature doesn't really grow that way. That's kind of something we impose as humans. And a lot of times they just grow wherever they kind of this like vines or if you want to think of like kudzu, like just kind of growing wherever it wants to, are teaching the things we have to teach to get the job done. to perform at the concert, to get the kids to audition, to do all the things. That's very much like the units or those crops. It's very like, here's Wordstarts, here's Wordstops. all this thing in between. But the ideas that we teach, the core of what it is to be musical in our ensembles, and I mean that to be income is everything, not just playing with that name, but like playing with a good sound and communicating musical information through some sort of group consensus, that's much more like a vine. That's much more like that kazoo, that just kind of grows wherever it wants to, and it can be a thread that connects everything, too. And so that, to me, is where it's good to start thinking about this, and even just re-articulating what we want to do in those new words can sometimes shake some things loose. So one of the things maybe I'd like to do is kind of take an aspect of what you're thinking about. Take one small slice, and see if you can apply something, like this would be a connecting thread that leads me back to. to August or September or whatever you start playing. So kind of take a second to think about that. So I'll share mine because it's not, I don't have the chance to teach an ensemble, which I wish I could, Cameron and David do a pretty darn good job. So I'm not really needed. But that said, I do think a lot about this in terms of I teach a two semester course. I teach like a junior high version and a high school version of how to be a band director. And this semester, how to be an orchestra director. And so a couple of the through ones I think about there, like the big one I'm thinking about now is critical thinking without calling it critical thinking. Like how do I get the students to listen to or recording or listen to performance and not just go, wow, needs to be louder or quieter. actually think deeper than dynamic changes or the way they may listen to a symphony concert and think down deeper of like okay what skills are they demonstrating they can do well? What are skills they are kind of like some kids are there and what are skills like nobody has a really good feel for and so they can start to then take that and go here are things that work here are things that need little attention here are things that are a five alarm firing we need to think about and that's the thread I'm trying to draw through everything so that I'm drawing their attention to that skill of assessing and thinking through student performance in as many different ways as I can without it becoming overwhelming so for like middle school classes for the musical focus classes we do a little bit with ensemble what we do a lot with like individual beginner sounds or individual instruction like you would in front of a homogenous beginner class which Ariana I know does not set them up to work outside of Texas but it's those are the cards we're dealt but like in the high school we do a lot more listening to ensembles and I have a collection of ensemble recordings. from not Texas. I won't say where they're from, but they're from not Texas. One, because that way they don't know. And two, ensemble, some of them are like, they can do the ensemble thing pretty well, but there are some very obvious gaps in the way they approach things, and that's, that's fine. That's where those groups come from. But then we transition to like the YouTube postings that people do of their pre YLs, and we pull up like Henry Middle School, like we pull up kind of your more standard, like here's a second band at a double C that's in a pretty far suburb of this major city. They suddenly have, I hope, a lot more tools to apply to that, that even though the ensemble sounds significantly better than what they're, they've been listening to, they still can go, oh, I hear that thing in a way that will unlock for them as a teacher the ability to go, oh, I hear that here's how I'm going to go about fixing it. So that's kind of how I'm thinking about threading in my microfilm and my course. What about y'all? @27:00 - Andrea T. Maher One of the, one of the big overlying threads for us is, you know, our kids start in fifth grade and we have schools that are fifth and sixth grade only and they only have, well it's Ted Regina's. They only have woodwind class, brass class, and percussion class. And they only get together for a concert so they may only have a couple of rehearsals before a performance. And so when they come to us, then they have the complete opposite. They have full van every day. They never break up until woodwinds brass or percussion unless we have sectionals. So our, so in a lot of ways we say we have to teach them how to do band because they don't know how to be in such a large group of students. They don't know how to react. They don't know how to rehearse in such a big setting of 65 kids and then teach the ensemble skills that they've never been taught. But at the same time, I still have to develop their individual skills. So it's a, that thread of teaching them how to be a band and to be a band member all the way through the year. is kind of a central idea for all our groups and how do you like what are some ways you kind of deploy that idea of like how to be a band uh some I mean basic we start off the years just like get to know your neighbor because they come from four different schools and so they all come together from and I'll think that some of them know each other some of them don't know anybody in the room so just get to know your section who sits next to you what's their name um and that starts us into we'll let's listen to your person next to your trio and then okay now you know their names like don't play louder than Joe Smith you know so kind of we do that first just getting them to know each other and stuff like that to kind of build that and then we can build from there but it's an interesting process it's very different you know than a lot of places that start their own beginners in sixth grade and and you know all the ways sixth grade one con rose kind of singular in that organization like @29:00 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Asadina does something similar to that, I think, where it's five, six, then a seven, eight. But again, the scale difference between Pasadena and Conro is pretty substantial, just in terms of the physical size of the district, to speak of the size of the programs. that idea of getting someone else's things and having to work with it, I think that's a really good thing to start with, though, is this idea of how do we work together as an ensemble? And one of the things that's come up in my research that's related to this, but not specifically about, like, pedagogy, that bands are some of the only organizations that are the size that they are, that are perpetually refreshing. like, choirs can get really big, but a lot of times if they're not a tattoo sent to the orchestra, they're gonna be a professional group, and then that's really about it. But, like, bands, especially when you look at bands the size of the ones we have here in Texas, they're six, eight groups that have three or four hundred kids in them. The only thing that they, that's not a band, because bands, like, this all over the world, but the only thing that's not that, that isn't a band that's that big is like a samba school in Brazil. A lot of other places, music is done at a much smaller scale, it's much more like maybe 10 to 12 people, or a game like 24 to 20 to 30, but still it's not hundreds of people that have to do the same together. So this idea of how do we operate as a social unit and how do we kind of react? I love that you said they don't know how to react because it might break up just seeing how middle schoolers react when they don't matter react, and that is every way under the sun, sometimes not in a helpful way, more often than not in a helpful way. And so like I love that you start with that and that's really cool. And it obviously shows up in what they do by the end of the year and what they do when they get to high school. So that's fantastic. Ariana, how about you? @30:51 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So I love that she brought that up because one of my goals as I grow the program is to eventually have, you know, sixth grade is what it is. And then I'm afraid to have a high strings and a low strings class and then eighth grade the ensemble group. that way they're kind of, I mean, I understand that yes, sixth grade is an ensemble, but not really. But that would give me that is something that I see the band directors here do is that, you know, they didn't get that time to address a lot of those like woodwind specific things because they were teaching an entire beginning band of one block. So they use seventh grade band to kind of help. They split to help make up for the deficiency. But my really strong point this year is was really funny that you mentioned it warm ups. Like that is what I'm really going after because that's been kind of a battle for me is like, I grew up on the blue book. I remember when I had to buy a new copy and I saw that one of the authors died I was reading the back I was like oh my god what like I still have my original copy from the Jackson middle school band in 1997. But I think I bought a euphonium copy for personally. And I was like, oh my gosh. And so to me, like, obviously out of the band game for quite a while, but like, you have to warm up. And I've noticed it was for orchestra that's very split. Some people are like, no, you just start playing whatever. And then like you had mentioned, there's a lot of technique work to be done. And again, as somebody who does not necessarily have those techniques or doesn't think about them because I wasn't taught them, I just had to learn them a week before my students. So I thought a cart was going to learn me, sorry. So I've been really struggling with that because so many people are like, oh, I just take it out of our music and I turn something into a warm up that day. I'm like, that's great. I don't have the mental capacity for that. I've got eight classes that I'm teaching, three different courses, plus three levels of orchestra, like, I can't do that. And so now I have a cart coming, There we go. So I've been looking at for a warm up book because then at that point we're like, I need somebody to tell me what to do. I was like, I just, I need, I don't need an idea. I just need it written out. And so that's something I'm looking to start this year. And I'm hoping will be that kind of kickstart refreshers just to really have, here's what we're going to do today. Here's how we remember how to do this and maybe tackle things that I didn't even think about that I'm always like, guys, we really got to work on using our whole boat there. What does that mean? Well, we know what that means, but have we done that in contact? Have I ever stopped to work on that? Have I started a class like that? Probably not, because it's all chaos. And so my brain, I feel like with that shift, because I shifted the COVID year, that was the year that we were, I was doing chorus and band, or chorus and orchestra at the same time. Two different classrooms, buildings. And then, you know, we will help for spring break and everything back. And so I don't think I ever fully got to like grasp how to start class, which feels so dumb saying that like that was like my ninth year teaching, I think eighth year teaching, like I should have known what I was doing at that point. But because it was something different and it was something that was really complex doing both at once, it just never clicked. And so I feel like I've almost failed my students in some ways because of that, because of my lack of knowledge, my kids can play rhythm all day long. They're great sight readers, they can play rhythm, they're fantastic, but they're missing some of that technique work. so I was just planning that you had mentioned that because that's really like what I'm looking to really attack this year is if I can start that, every day as we go from 80 minute classes to 50 minute classes now, they're still every other day, right? You know, what can I do that can make that 50 minutes now, so that 80 minutes, even more impactful. What can I do that's going to last even longer in a shorter amount of time? @35:05 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, and I mean, that's the, the ever other day is challenging. It's even more challenging when you have ever other day for what would be a normal class period, the 50 minutes rather than like an hour and a half or, you know, some other schools get. Um, so I mean, that, that in and of itself is challenging. And I wouldn't be too harsh on yourself. I think any of us who are teachers look back on our teaching of X years ago, well, I really didn't do the best for my students there. Like I could have been better and, you know, we're all where we are and we meet the challenges we meet with the tools we have. And as long as we're trying to get better tools, I think we're doing the right things. Um, so, so be gentle with yourself, especially, especially since you were spinning so many plates and then COVID added to the Luby's order, which that's a part. Um, they don't want to have the Luby's by UH though, just, just so everyone's gone. @35:58 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) It is gone. @35:59 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) It is gone. lot that who knows what will be built, hopefully something exciting or at least useful. So, but thinking about fundamental skills, about warm-ups and this idea and like, you grew up, you grew up in Texas, right? @36:15 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Yeah. @36:17 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) like, you you kind of know the the the Kool-Aid we don't bring down here about like what warm-up to and how they function. And being around U of H, like, we take it to a ridiculous extent sometimes. I still remember watching Tom Bennett rehearse the Wind Ensemble when they were preparing for TMA in 2005. And like, it was the first year player would play an interval up and an interval down within articulation and everybody else had to figure out what the articulation was, like what the rhythm was, but also what the intervals were and they weren't the same, it wasn't didn't mirror itself. So, like, yeah, we can we can go all day long and play some Sundays thinking about fundamentals at U of H and personally that is where my happiness lies, but at the same time that tool of thinking about fundamental skills. So like, this is where I think maybe it might be good not to wait on the high school people to tell you what they want. Instead, go, what does it look like they do? Like, what are some things that make sense there and just start with that as kind of a proximal goal? But then also, and I'll send you an email, I'll connect you to email area to our outgoing string person. ACTION ITEM: Connect Ariana with Aaron Hansen, a former U of H orchestra director, to discuss teaching orchestra outside of Texas - WATCH @37:22 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) She's moving up to Illinois. @37:25 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Her name's Aaron Hansen. She's got a lot of great information, especially about teaching not in Texas. @37:30 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Like, she's done in Michigan for a long time. That would be awesome, thank you. @37:33 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) That's probably a more supportive sort of setup than what you're describing. But at the same time, it's heterogeneous versus homogenous. It's not every day. you've got all these different things. And she's very sensitive to people who are not orchestra people operating in the orchestra space in terms of that they need a little bit more support. @37:53 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So I'll connect you to get email. @37:55 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) But to me, what you have the opportunity to do is one, make the warm up something that is going to build that skill, obviously, but to make it something where, especially as you mentioned, like, you've kind of got a bit of chaos, embrace the chaos a little bit, let it break little but give the kids jobs within that. And, you know, maybe you don't have a ton of great student leaders, but maybe you have a few and maybe make them, okay, you go in this corner, you go in this corner, have no idea how big your room is, but like, segment them out and go, okay, we're going to do the first three minutes is getting things together and setting ourselves up. then the next seven is going to be these three exercises, Bob, you're going to lead that one, Julie, going to lead that one, you know, SMA, going to lead that one. And you just have them do a little like round robin and all of sudden, don't have to work on the skill necessarily. You don't have to be directly responsible for they're doing, you're responsible for going around and monitoring and being like, how's how's that going? And then you can kind of bring them all back together. We're fine a little bit if you need to then move on to do the next thing and maybe maybe maybe like peak days where it's like Okay, it's Tuesday. We're gonna do this thing and Thursday. We'll do this or whatever your a day B day looks like Because that all the sudden empowers the kids to that gives them a little bit in what they're doing and We know that kids are like brutal with each other in terms of their evaluation of others They might not say it sometimes they do in middle school But they have years they can hear things and they can hear when things are right and when things are wrong and the more we empower them to Not just have those opinions, but do something with them. The more we start to build their internal musicianship. @39:38 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) I think right. @39:40 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I like them That and I mean play around with that like make it super simple at first make it like hold this note still for acts or like frog to tip Over eight counts at whatever tempo marking works or strings So like you know stuff that stuff that they can get easy wins, right? And then you can start moving in to technique and doing the things like here's how we shift the third position that we do this thing and then maybe even segment them by the three instrument families. If you're in trouble club go here, you're in altar club go here and if you're in place club go here and if you're a viola and can't read altar club just go cry because that's really all you can do. @40:19 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Or you're me. @40:22 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I moveable clefs make me, I taught high school in the bassoon or trombone A2 to go into this I'd write letters then. I was ashamed. @40:32 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) They laugh at me. I'm like okay hang on CB. Okay this is an E or usually it's like the violin two-line. It's a little weird. But I will say something that's like a happy accident that I discovered I got a doctor beat last year. probably one of the only orchestra people with one but you know it's okay and accidentally switching it to like the beats not like not the straight quarters but you know it has like those rhythms that it'll play. Oh yeah. Yeah. And so, like, I would actually do that. Sometimes I'd be like, all right, do scale, let's go. And just doing their scales to whatever, you know, popped up on the Dr. B and they're like, Oh, okay, I can do this. I can do this. @41:14 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Evan, if you can find the tempo, and this is probably something you can do if it's like music that is danceable, look for the BPM and get a karaoke track of like something that's popular, this school of program, which that makes it hard. But like, hot to go, maybe is not what you want to do with them, but things like that. And put that as the backing track for playing scales. If you're worried about just technique and all you want to do is focus on that. when you're focused on quality of sound, take that away and go, okay, let's do this half tempo and really focus on it, feeling the same. But the sound being the thing we're doing and then speed it back up and do that thing. But like, I mean, the fact that you have a Dr. B means that your kids are probably a lot more accurate in ensemble settings than others because they're more aware of that thing. @41:58 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Right, because they hear it a lot. They're like, can you turn it off? @42:02 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) No. @42:02 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Not yet. No, not. @42:04 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) No, no. But I mean, and that's another thing too, though, like, and this is something we talk about in my undergraduate classes, but it's something I've talked about for a long time, because not being in Texas, I had to defend the metronome a lot. I had to be like, this is why we use it, and this is what we do with it, because people out, you know, in the broader world, and you've experienced it. know right now, maybe you have to, Andrea, the Texas is a musical conversation or the kids are robots conversation often centers back to what you have that metronome going the entire time. It's like, okay, you know what, if we're using the metronome 100% of the rehearsal and it's the day before the concert, yeah, we screwed up as teachers, right? But how else are the kids going to learn steady time, except through a metronome? Not to say anything of playing together as a group or understanding subdivisions of the beat, steady time does not something that we as humans do very well, just cool as a crowd clap when the fight song happens at a football game, like it's everywhere. And so, you know, thinking about that, though, the thing that that kind of has come to my mind is that, like, the, the metronome is a scaffold. If we want to think about educational terminology, or I also, we're just training wheels. You you need them for a while. And, and at some point, with the metronome, it's not training wheels because you need it to kind of give you a reference, but then it goes away. @43:21 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) You don't need it as much. @43:22 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) so, we as teachers need to have a plan for okay, here's not just how we're going to take out the metronome, like it's marching band. Like, okay, here's the first movement, no metronome. it's going to be, here's how I want to build their skill with the metronome, so that it's not that they don't need it. that it's already inside of them and they don't have function without the audible click-track thing. And, you know, I think that is something that maybe, I know I lost sight of as band director sometimes, when I was teaching, especially teaching the lower skill level groups, the groups that kind of need a little bit more loving care and the ones that maybe don't necessarily want to practice all the time. Um, you know, like it's a temptation turn a metronome and go and the more I didn't do that, more I was very intentional about when we took it away and making them do things on their own, like training wheels, the stronger those kids got. Sometimes they would, you know, jump up to the first band, sometimes they'd jump up to the second band, but we always started every semester with a conversation of, okay, this is the concert band and we have two other bands and you have to audition into those. My goal here is that you're not in this band next semester. You're not in this band next year. I want to see you move up. I want to see you have those experiences too. And you know, I would say probably 60% of them did, which for a community like Waller, where we didn't have access to a lot of private lesson teachers was not a bad thing and the band's got better. So, but this idea that you mentioned, Ariana, of thinking about like the metronome is kind of being a weird thing. I sparked that because again, that's another thread that we can pull on, of how to play as an ensemble because it's a related skill, but it's a different skill than playing by ourselves. And I think that's something maybe to keep in mind to, given both of you or middle school teachers, and it's something that's present in your mind, because you know, these kids don't know what they don't know when it comes to being in an ensemble. know they're sitting next to somebody, but what to do with that information is not intuitive. It's very much a learned process. ACTION ITEM: Implement new activities like fundamental technique exercises, circle orchestra, and scrambled seating to address skill gaps, boost technique, and improve morale and engagement. - WATCH And so kudos for both of you for kind of making that a priority early in your year. @45:23 - Andrea T. Maher Well, I think Ariana, I think you have more to draw than you in of like organizing your class. think, you know, you can still like steal from the band world where, you know, we do like 10 minutes of warm up, 10 minutes of technique, and then the rest music or some version of that. And you did that all your band life. And I think you can bring that to your orchestra class or if you ever had to do choir again, you can still use that same organization to your time. @45:54 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) And I think you have more skills than you give yourself credit for. Yeah, it's actually when in terms of how to structure the learning and I think that's that's a really key thing that we all need to embrace when we run into situations that are maybe novel. @46:12 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Well, thank you. Yeah, I think I let myself get overwhelmed a couple of years ago. Since I was just taking my beginners to assessment and I've refused. Which is a different conversation. But so we had a clinician come in instead and she was like first thing like you are an orchestra person. Stop saying you're a band person. was like, yes, ma'am. She's like, you are doing so many things. Well, and I think I just kind of. Because I'm such a perfectionist probably coming out of a Texas band program, you know, like. I had to be a perfectionist. There was no choice. There was there was no option. And so I think I kind of let myself get mentally overwhelmed with, like I said, what I don't know. Instead of being like, I do know how. to do this part of it, let's go. And while we're doing that part, let me fill in the gaps that I don't know and add it, you know. @47:07 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So I think we're all that place. Imposter syndrome is not something that only the other person has in the conversation. I can promise you that it is we are all dealing with variants of that. And I think you set this up really well, Ariana, because the kind of next thing on my list of things to talk about was this idea that was kind of made me like squint my eyes and have to really think for little bit, but then it's like, oh, okay, is that within all of this, when we're talking about instructional design and like where things happen and how to connect with pieces, there is a difference between teaching and learning. Because if we think about what a good classroom looks like, like you mentioned Ariana, this kind of chaos, like when we think of the ideal classroom, we're often thinking about it's quiet because they're attentive, they're making I contact their engage with something. And all those are kind of external markers of learning. But we also know for experience that those are always not internal. We're reflected internally. You know, even if they're like doing the thing, it's like they might be thinking about who knows what. probably don't want to know what they're thinking about especially in middle school. But this idea that there is a difference, they're related. And we often think one leads to the next without really having to, you know, make any further steps. But there is a difference between us teaching and the students learning. And sometimes that difference is in the way that they interact with the material. So for instance, you know, one of the things we know is that the learning modalities, the visuals and oral and kinesthetic learners is kind of not 100% accurate. Like it's everybody's got, you know, variations of that. It's not quite as clear cut as they made it back when they talked about that. But the way students tend to learn best in. and arts settings, especially performing arts, is by doing things. And so the repetition count is high. But then we go, well, what if they're doing it wrong? we're repeating mistakes, basically. so building a way that we can do the teaching, but then have a really, really, really, really, really short window or short time span before we can start assessing is the learning happening. Because the only way we know learning is happening is by what they demonstrate. And the only way we know that really robust learning is happening, really stuff that's going to last beyond that day is having them do it when they don't think about it directly. Like, they're just kind of the natural fallback. Like, we think about a kid, and you see that kid pick their instrument. And you can tell before they make a sound, kind of where they're out on their journey. Like, if they're, like, of pointing everywhere and they're a mess and they can't sit still, you kind of don't expect them to come in and sound like Chris Martin. But they pick up their trumpet. It's very intentional. And they set themselves up, if they make a sound that's more like Chris Martin, you're going to be a lot less surprised. And so that idea of the learning being their demonstration of the skill away from the kind of us like looking at them daggers in our eyes is a thing that we want to try and get to as quickly as possible, I think, as far as being teachers. And so, you know, assessment piece, we always do formative assessment, we're always listening to kids. But then when we have them, this kind of gets to what we're talking about with you, Ariana, is, you know, when they do things, whether it's really isolated skills or application, both skills to something in technique or application of all that music, how often are we letting them go, do the thing, try different ways, kind of learn like, you know, pre-ranked chickens, and then come back together to see if the skill got better, like, how often are we doing that? the answer is not often at all, maybe explore that, because that might be a way one, the kids get a problem. break. You know, they only want to listen to us for so long. But two, it gives them a little bit more freedom at a time in which middle schoolers love. They love to feel like big kid. mean, an eight-year-old who might as well be in middle school because she likes to feel like a big kid so much. And all of that stuff suddenly becomes less about the classroom looking a certain way and more about the actual product we get because of the way we let our classroom operate. I mean, does that like scare you this thing? Because it scared me when I first ran, like, I don't know if I am willing to give up that kind of control to the kids. Or does it strike you as like, oh, already do something like that. @51:43 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) This is what it is. Go ahead, Ariana. Sorry. Oh, I was going to say I do every now and then I'll do stuff like that. Or maybe as an ensemble, try something one way and then we'll try another way and another way and we'll kind of like let the class come to a consensus about it. But I've never- usually if I let them scatter to work on something, it just ends up being social hour. So I kind of give up on that. So I don't know if I need to be more directed, if I need to move around more when that happens, because I like the idea, which is why I keep trying it. It just doesn't typically work in my setting, which means I'm not setting it up correctly. @52:25 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Well, or it's just there are certain challenges you might face given the kids you have in that room. @52:33 - Andrea T. Maher Well, and like I've done this this was the first shoot that I've kind of done this. You know, we play through a scale and it sounds terrible as a full band. So I'll say practice that on your own for like 15 seconds and we're gonna try it again. I like practice on your own. And they do. They sit because I only give them 10 or 15 seconds and they'll practice that scale and we'll play it again and it'll be maybe this much better. But it did get a little better or sometimes if we go through a technical passage and eat. and that we're playing a real slow. I'll just let them practice on their own, but only like 10 or 15 seconds, because any more than that, then you might get Careless Whisper or the Haysong or something like that. So I've done that. I probably did it a little more than I probably should have this year, but like you said, it gives the kids a break. And they're gonna do it anyway. You know, if we play a scale and it's terrible, they want to play it on their own. And they'll try it. So like, oh, we're just gonna buy into it. And so we did that a few times and it seemed to work because I did it only for a short amount of time. Today I was in a clinic and they said something like, like Ariana, you were saying like, sometimes when you have kind of a crazy day, the David Puckett and Richard Alvarado said, embrace it and make that the one day you have, you know, sit by your friend day and everybody scatters and sits in a different place in your orchestra room. and we do circle orchestra. Everybody makes the big giant circle and play. he said, you know, that one day, you know, the kids will remember the fun of that one day and it'll, it'll pay you more dividends in morale because you embraced the chaos and you just went with it that one day. And, you know, he's like, make it better. @54:21 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You may not, but the kids will remember when they did circle orchestra or when they got to sit by their friends. @54:27 - Andrea T. Maher And so sometimes if it's too chaotic, like just immersive. @54:31 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) That is actually something like all throw timers. I use classroom screen a lot. @54:36 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) don't know you know that. @54:38 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) But since we're supposed to have our learning targets posted, then I didn't have like a rotating set of things or I'll have that on one screen, classroom screen on the other. But I'll set like 15 minute timers. Okay, we have 15 minutes for this piece. Find a new place to sit, go and we'll rehearse for 15 minutes. We'll, you know, address whatever new issues pop up because suddenly we're not coming with our section. And we can't hear that part. so, oh, it didn't go right. Let's talk about that. OK, minutes is up. Next piece by Denise Clothosico. And that's something that the kids really, really do like. So yes, I do love the whole historical playing or the scrambled seating. @55:15 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) That's all I've been And I think that gets us something that one of our graduate students who does a lot of presenting talks about where it's not so much about the pedagogy of what you're teaching and the technique. It's more about paying into the relationship bank with the kids as an ensemble. I see you. It's a crazy day. You're in middle school. You're crazy to begin with. Let's lean into that today. As long as we get some very basic things done, we're good. And I will make this as fun as possible. But then tomorrow, you have to come in and we're back to kind of doing things a different way. And so that it's not always the same flavor of ice cream. So I love that too. And one of the things I always did was talk about, OK, want you to do this five times. Five times. And then put your instrument up. And when everyone's instrument is down, I know we're ready to go, and you know, social pressure works on that, but they even within us, okay, in those five times, what were some different ways you did work on that thing? techniques, what strategies did you use? And like, I taught high school kids for the majority of my career, so you could talk about things in that kind of abstract way, but even like with little kids like, hey, did you play or working on scales? Did you play the mini scales? Did you play mini scale? Like the first five notes, and then the next five notes, and then put those two things together, like the two added monster on Sesame Street, and some of them are like, no, I don't need that, but some of them like, oh, oh, I forgot about that. That was in sixth grade. Oh yeah, and all of sudden they have this tool that they're going to use again, or hey, did you play that at Hack Tempo, or did you play that like in, you know, for the kids to get really bored, the ADD talented kids like, did you swing that? Did you, you know, did you play it like little two note groups and do your thing or, you know, whatever it is, or like the kids like, I played the the Arbon A2, or I played the Clark Study, so I gave you that. I'm glad you did that. You know, because then all of sudden, it's not just repetition for the kids that are paying attention. It's, oh, there are ways I can practice this that make the practicing improve me faster, you know, rather than just play it five times. And then we're done. It's like, well, it's going to get a little bit better. You get better doing the thing. But the more we can build these awarenesses in, like, oh, if I'm having trouble with this kind of thing, here are some tools I have. And not every kid's going to remember all of them, but if they're exposed to them, they stand a better chance than if we don't talk about them at all. And they're probably not learning them anywhere else. And so, like, to me, that becomes a really valuable part of, again, if we're talking about building skills over time, how do I approach this as an individual musician? And how do I bring that to the ensemble? I mean, that's level one level two listening within what Mr. talks about, but he's not the only one that talked about that. He just gave it names. So we tend to point to him first. But within all of that, too, I think that the way we think about ensemble. in terms of an individual's contribution to it, frames a lot of that. If it's, that's got to sound better and we don't talk to the individual, all of a sudden we're reinforcing, well, part might or might not matter and if I get it right fine, but as long as it sounds good overall, gonna be all right rather than, hey, we need everybody to be on the same level here. go practice that, be able to play it perfectly twice and then put your instrument down and like make it something they can do. But yeah, I definitely agree with Andrea that the time aspect of it is like, okay, you can do that for this many seconds or you can do that for this many reps and then put your instrument down is a good place to start to kind of keep the pulse of class going in. sometimes too, they don't need to leave their seats to do that. They can just be like, okay, here's, stop. seconds, which at that on your own or do that twice and then we'll come back and just leave them sitting in their seats. But sometimes that, you know, scramble seating, it looks like, you know, the rice mob doing a marching band show is exactly what they need. And it just depends, you gotta read the kids and read the room. But to me, to kind of close this out, this idea of connecting fall to spring is kind of something we talk about more at band, and especially in high school band, because there is a pretty clear divide sometimes between the way we approach marching band and the way we approach sit-down band, which I've never subscribed to, but I've known some people too. But to me, what this kind of points out, what these conversations point out, is that the things we tend to think of, like Andrea being in the six-day honor band room, where people are playing crazy literature at really high level, it's just mind blowing. It kind of makes you want to just hang it up and be like, okay, I'm never gonna do that, so we're done. Well, that would be me, because I don't teach on solos anymore. But within that, that's a secondary marker of achievement to me in a given year. Like that, it's almost like, how will those kids play a fundamental skills and ensemble is the primary marker of their learning? Like, how we play, you know, the... we play one or how we play this exercise that combines, you know, like a scalar thing with articulation and range and all that, like how we can make that sound as an ensemble, that's a primary marker because that shows up in the literature and it shows up at a much, much higher level maybe because there's fewer people doing it. But if everyone can do it at a really high level, we know that they have the skills and it's just a matter of getting their brains around how to do that in that setting. And so to me, this idea of creating threads and connections through the year is way less about how the literature lines up. think it's going to because that's the way we think and it should because that is helpful to the students, but it's more about how the fundamental skills develop over time. And we're working where we are working on those and I'm going to show up in the music or pulling them from the music and we see a consistent kind of group of them moving across the year. All of a sudden, we're achieving both the primary and the secondary improvement matrices if we want to think about that way. But another way to think about it too, that we kind of touched on a little bit is it's more about their personal accountability and how they do things, how students approach their instrument individually, but also then in the ensemble. That's a primary marker of learning, like how when they pick up their instrument, what do they do and how do they approach problems? How do they solve the problems before we as the teacher need to go and solve them for them? And given that so many of our kids come from either helicopter parents or what's the new one bulldozer parents or snow plow parents or there's all sorts of parenting that involves destroying the thing in front of your kids so they don't have to face challenges, we know that that's something they're going to need because the real world doesn't have that. You know, your mom and dad aren't going to bring you your briefcase at the job interview because you forgot at home, at least I hope they're not. So, you know, this idea of how they approach things kind of as an add-on benefit of, okay, if we expect these things out of them, over time they're going to grow into them. It's just up to us to be one patient but also realistic of, am I doing enough? And the answer's probably going to be, no, I can always do more. We always think that way because... these humans are really good at identifying problems, especially musicians. There's actually research out that says our self-efficacy, our thought process about how well we do things, he's in the gutter, absolutely in the bottom of the dumpster compared to everybody else, musicians in general. We have terrible, terrible mental health, which we as musicians go, well, yeah, that makes sense, but it's not just us, it's all musicians. So we at least have that going for us. And so to me, this idea of one patient on our part, also building these skills and students, that's a way to combat that. That's way to go, no, you have this power to do this thing. By the time you get done here, you don't need me anymore. You've got all the tools and you know how to do the thing. when a kid graduates from the Clean High School or graduates from the Woodlands High School or graduates from any high school, the goal there to me as a teacher should be that they can operate completely independently of their music program and still be a functional musician in an ensemble context. And maybe the Americans sound the best for the context that they show, but at Mediachi, they might not really know what they're doing, but they have the tools to go, oh, I hear that thing, so I'm going to imitate it. I know how this works in an ensemble, but I'm going to do these things, at least as a place to start. And to me, if we're doing that as teachers, on top of keeping them excited about music and giving them a place to experience the emotional release and all the cool things that happen in there and keeping them wanting to do that after they leave high school and after they leave college, I think we're doing a very good job. But part of that comes down to, what are the threads that we connect across that academic year and how do we grow those from year to year with our kids, especially if we see them in different ensembles every year? All of sudden then it becomes something where it's like, okay, here's what this level of the game looks like. This is sixth grade, here's seventh grade, it's this level, it's harder room. The sun is trying to kill you like it does in Mario. And then this over here, and all of a sudden we have these manufactured and these systemic levels. That we can just play within and see what works for our kids to get them to the places we want them to get to so I mean to me that is That kind of thought process is a lot more freeing than I got to do this piece by Maine It's got to be perfect and it's got it so all the sudden I have little bit more one freedom to explore things But to the the focus is not how can I make you know this piece? Sound amazing the focus is how do I make the ensemble sound amazing? While doing this piece like how do I give them the skills to sound amazing that we can raft onto this piece or whatever piece We put in front of them and I mean that's that's part of how mr. got his kids to play music for Prague in 1970 Because it was written two years before There are still some colleges that can't get through that piece and yet his middle schoolers did all that being said I know it's what partially it's the magic of it being green All of us wish we had in all this trying foster when we see it in ourselves But I don't want to hold you guys long because I know we went over last time, but did you guys get the materials that I sent out, like the summary recap and all that, okay, good. You'll be getting another one of those in the morning, and this tab and thing is way more powerful than I thought it was going be. So it does some really cool things. So I'm going to see if I can boost those up to and how I share stuff and how I'm documenting things. I'm learning the tool and I think it's really cool, and I'm going see if I can pay for it for me. We'll see. @1:05:32 - Andrea T. Maher I'm not holding my breath, but... @1:05:34 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) All right. Well, thank you guys so much, and I hope you have a great rest of your evening, and I will see you next week.",

                "content": "﻿Ensemble Director Refresh - July 25, 2024 VIEW RECORDING - 66 mins (No highlights) Meeting Overview In the session on connecting spring to fall curriculum, educators discussed innovative approaches to create a more cohesive and effective learning experience throughout the academic year. The focus shifted from disconnected units based solely on performance literature to overarching \"threads\" or \"strands\" of fundamental musical skills that span the entire year. This approach emphasizes active learning, with students demonstrating skills through application rather than passive instruction. To build student ownership and accountability, strategies such as short individual practice times during rehearsals, student-led warm-ups, and scrambled seating arrangements were proposed. The goal is to develop students' problem-solving abilities and musical independence. Implementation ideas include identifying core skill threads (like tone, articulation, and ensemble playing) that apply across all literature, incorporating structured \"chaos\" to boost engagement, using short timed practice sessions, and having students explain their practice strategies. By framing ensemble improvement in terms of individual contributions and accountability, educators aim to create a curriculum that goes beyond performance obligations, fosters musical independence, and prepares students to be mature, skilled performers after graduating. The key to this approach is consistently revisiting fundamental skills across all literature while gradually empowering students to take ownership of their musical development, providing flexibility in repertoire selection while systematically building transferable core abilities. Key Takeaways * Instead of teaching in disconnected units based solely on performance literature, the group discussed having overarching \"threads\" or \"strands\" of fundamental musical skills (tone, articulation, ensemble playing, etc.) that span the entire academic year. * These skill threads would be revisited consistently across any literature studied, providing a cohesive focus beyond just performance obligations. * There was an emphasis on students actively demonstrating learning through the application of skills, not just being taught techniques by the teacher. * Strategies were explored for giving students ownership, such as short individual practice times, having them lead warmups, scrambling seating, etc. This builds personal accountability. * The group highlighted the difference between teaching techniques and actual learning when students can independently apply those techniques. * A key goal was developing students' problem-solving ability as musicians, preparing them for independence after graduating from the music program. Topics Curriculum Threads/Strands The traditional approach of teaching disconnected units based on performance literature was challenged. Instead, the group advocated for identifying overarching \"threads\" or \"strands\" of fundamental musical skills that could connect all the literature studied throughout the year. These fundamental skills, such as tone production, articulation, ensemble playing, sight-reading, etc., apply to any piece of music. By consistently revisiting and developing these skills across all literature, students would build a strong musical foundation rather than just preparing separate concert programs. This thread-based approach provides more flexibility in choosing literature while systematically developing core abilities that transfer to any music. It gives the curriculum a cohesive focus beyond just performance obligations. Application of Learning Simply teaching techniques is not enough - students must have opportunities to actively apply those skills individually, away from the teacher's observation. This independent application demonstrates true learning has occurred beyond just being taught. Strategies were discussed for facilitating this, such as: * Giving students short individual practice times during rehearsals to work on skills * Having students lead warmup exercises * Scrambling the ensemble's seating to create new listening environments This helps build students' personal accountability as musicians and problem-solving abilities since the teacher is not constantly watching over them. Challenges in Connecting Fall/Spring The educators shared the challenges they face in trying to connect the fall and spring semesters cohesively: * Andrea (who is planning to submit for honor band) has to balance preparing very difficult UIL contest literature for the spring while still making time for more engaging/fun music for concerts. * Ariana, coming from a band background, sometimes struggles to identify which fundamental string technique skills to prioritize teaching her orchestra students. * The constant demands of performances can make it difficult to maintain a consistent focus on skill development throughout the year. Embracing Structured \"Chaos\" While rehearsals need structure, the group discussed the value of occasionally embracing productive \"chaos\" or freedom for students. This helps build relationships and empowers them to take ownership. Strategies included: * Doing scrambled seating like a circle orchestra for a change of perspective * Using timers to give short bursts of individual practice time during rehearsals * Suggesting different practice strategies besides just straight repetition * Allowing these less-structured environments gives students a break from constant teaching while still reinforcing skills. Next Steps Some key next steps were identified: * Ariana will connect with an outgoing string faculty member for advice on fundamental technique skills to prioritize teaching orchestra students. * Both will explore warm-up books and other resources for systematic technique development. * They will implement short individual practice times within rehearsals, guiding students to use specific strategies. * Moments of structured \"chaos,\" like circle seating, will be built into rehearsal plans to empower students. The goal is to develop independent, problem-solving musicians who can apply their skills beyond following the teacher's instructions. It is crucial to connect the fall and spring with consistent skill development threads. Transcript @7:15 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) But okay, done tap dancing. I think we've got everybody here that's going to be here today. So um, but what I was going to offer is, you know, I wasn't super happy with the quads that you got tried to get through on Tuesday and then like we ran out and time we ran over. So I changed the script a little bit today. There's not going to be a power point. going to be much more of a discussion based session in Ariana. know you probably doing bedtime kid things or dealing with kids at bedtime. @7:47 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) I'm actually on my walk because I haven't gotten to do that yet today. @7:52 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay, well, excellent. Well, feel free to chime in whenever. We are we're talking and you know, thing I wanted to talk about today. @8:00 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So @8:00 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) That again, I'm sorry. @8:00 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Were y'all talking about honor band? @8:03 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, we're just kind of doing the blow by blow Dawson high school one. @8:07 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) OK, in six, which, wow. @8:10 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, I mean, Aaron's going to have a year because he's doing Midwest. He's doing honor band. They're going to make state marching contest because of the area they're in. So he's going to need a bit of a sabbatical. @8:22 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) I think he should just take April and and may off and just kind of do his own thing. @8:27 - Andrea T. Maher Crazy. OK, cool. @8:30 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So yeah, it's a good time down here in Texas. @8:34 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Sounds like it. @8:35 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Um, but today what I wanted to talk about is kind of something I know we all do. I know we're all familiar with how this works. And so rather than be like, here's this new idea, I wanted to kind of talk through some of ways I think about it and then actually have a chance to kind of workshop some ideas and see what we think about this, this idea of curriculum as something that's not boring. Um, I don't know. if you're, when you came into the profession, if the vertical alignment thing was still a thing in professional development, I know when I started teaching in Keller and O2, that was like the thing you did in fine arts PD, if you weren't, if you actually got fine arts PD, you did vertical alignment between your middle school and high school and make sure everything all lines up, and it's not that, it's not what we're talking about today. That's so important, it's very tedious and has a lot of value, but is, again, tedious and not for doing things over Zoom. There's no refreshing about that. But the thing that keeps on coming to mind for me, and this has been something that's kind of rattled around my brain a lot and finally landed on something that I think I can call it a, like give it a name. And that is this idea of, we often think in units when we're teaching, like I have to do this thing till this date. And then I do this thing until this date. then we just kind of like look at all our performance obligations and auditions and things and work backwards, which is great because that lets us plan out a year. But there are things we miss if that's the only way we look at it. And it's unlikely that any one of us on this call only look at it that way, but there's a temptation, especially for younger teachers to look at it that way. And so, what I wanted to do is talk about kind of ways to think through the year or ways that I've thought of to think of through the year that might help one give y'all who are experiencing teachers more tools, but two younger teachers, they can get kind of caught in that getting slapped in the face every two weeks with something I need to do. This kind of gives them a thread to hang on to that at least in the midst of that, which is just part of a new job, they can still make forward progress on areas within what they want to cover. But before we get into that too deeply, but think about that. What are some things that come to mind for you about challenges that crop up when you're trying to maintain some sort of cohesive through line or some kind of central focus to your curriculum through an academic year? What are some things that are challenging about deploying the curriculum you want throughout your, you know, your hundred and eighty days in front of the kids? @11:30 - Andrea T. Maher Well, for me, this upcoming year is a triple C honor band year. And so, you know, I've already I've already been in contact with my clinician since May already looking at what's going to be our UIL program, whatever some possibilities, and then backtracking from there, like, okay, if I'm going to play this, what am I going to play at Christmas to help build skills into that? And to me, I mean, it's really great the way that works, but the downs side of that is there's no spring concert with like fun movie music and pop tunes and the end of the year like the musical reward for all this hard work like we go straight all the way to mid May 11th 15th with the same music the whole spring semester and and that's what we do but at the same time all the rest of the bands get to do the fun stuff the fun music and to make this hard lit this hard uil lit fun for the kids and fresh all the way from December one to the end of the year is is a challenge yeah I can imagine and you know with with that too like it's you can kind of paint it as like okay you're the top ensemble this is a cool thing we get to do nobody else has access to but it can be a grind I'm sure like what are you thinking through your program like what are some Considerations you have for what you're gonna play for that There's a piece called Helios on the great four lists that we're looking at and then we're trying to figure out What to put with it? We're actually gonna look at a grade three and see like maybe the old red mill or variations on Scarborough fair or something like that because in the past I've done a great five and and this year two really hard grade fours and It wasn't as successful as it needed to have men or should have been so You know trying to find that fine line of a program that's competitive, but also Really really good. It's got to be amazing. @13:44 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So It's a challenge Yeah, that would be a challenge and you know I think one of the things the honor band process does do like you said is it creates this kind of runway for you because you have to think back Through okay, this is the spring what I'm doing in the in the fall and have and that actually ties really well into what we're talking about today. But that's not to say that playing the same three pieces for an entire semester is not a stream on everyone, including the teacher. @14:13 - Andrea T. Maher So what about Ariana? Like, I'd be curious what your answer is being in Virginia. Like, what is that for you? @14:23 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So, for me, my big struggle, think, is that orchestra still isn't really my home base. So, sometimes they don't really know what I'm missing. If that makes sense, I don't know what are things that I should have done by now. last year, this past year was the first year I've had a group that shifted before they left me. Which I should be doing every year, but, you know, rebuilding after COVID has been really, really difficult. So that's one of those goals that I really need to hit. I need to be bigger on scales. But I think just trying to Trying to my, I'm still, I think it's a mix of not being familiar enough with literature and orchestra and general still, know, going on year six in middle school, but two of those years were COVID years. So not sure how much those count. And knowing how to push my kids, they're going to be by grade level. They're not necessarily by ability. Like when I was in middle school, we had a top band, a top eight period, a top seventh, and then a mix. And I just have a grade seventh grade and then beginners, beginners can be any grade level, which at least is nice. So trying to be better about understanding where where they are at the end of the year and how to catch them back up in August, doing that a little bit faster, I think, having a stronger plan of restarting so that I can be in a better place by winter. alignment's been really tough for me and I know that that's like he said it's not what we're doing but I really do like to the high school directors what do you need my kids to do that way I know what I need to have them ready for because again it says things that like as somebody who grew up playing oboe and studied to teach band originally I don't like I said I don't know what I'm missing so those are those big clues that I'm really looking for what do you need out of them so I can hopefully I can try to have them ready. @16:28 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Right and mean that's that's a struggle even if you do know the content area because you know like middle schoolers or middle schoolers you know they're consistently inconsistent but like how far can you push them and you know you ask them on a Texas for like well I mean they could play Dionysia actually tried real hard but you know at the same time is that right for your community is that right for your skill set like not every community is going to support the kind of time investment you need to place from those pieces and operate at that level right away and so you know, even your specific situation, Ariana, of thinking about like, okay, the high school is doing something and they're not great about communicating that maybe. But even if they are, like knowing how to connect the pieces from where it gets hard or where they need to be in an area that's still little unfamiliar and COVID kind of took two good years out of maybe three, I don't know how liberal Virginia was at that point. In Texas, took two weeks, it's fine. Pretty much, yeah. But the fact that we are, you know, still digging out of that and they're still kind of rebuilding the program is both an opportunity but also kind of an albatross. It's like you have that weight on your back of having to get that thing done. But yeah, both of these kind of topics I think will fit really well into what we're talking about today. So the very first thing I like to think about getting back to the study of units and things like that is, you know, we have obvious things we need to do in performing arts. have concerts. We have we have, you know, kind of this milieu of stuff that ends up on our calendar and we work backwards from there because we really want to do well in those situations. And that's good. But often younger teachers can turn into like months of the week like, okay, what do we need to fix today? Rather than like, okay, we're working on this long term thing. So rather than units, I like to think about threads or strands that run through my year. Where for instance, know, the second band or the third band or, you know, really any ensemble, but I'm thinking, you know, an ensemble where skill development is still very much a you can tangibly see it improve. The thing I like to think about there is, okay, what are our fundamental skills? What are the things we're doing that I can connect across anything we're playing and how am I setting those up to be successful? So for instance, let's say I'm teaching that that in varsity middle school band. So we're, you know, looking at a grade two grade ones, I think is the minimum. and for triple C, right? Or grade one, grade two, is kind of where people end up. By the time I left, brings up where I ended up, and they've since improved dramatically from there, probably because I'm gone. But the thing that I thought about there always was, okay, so we're playing this music, great. And we play kind of the stuff we can play at beginning of the year, that's dance of the C scale, cheer one, pretty straightforward stuff. by the end of the year, we're doing stuff with maybe two independent motives. And, you know, like, great locomotive chase might be like the big thing. And now that's actually was a stretch for my kids, but that's neither here nor there. But using the skills that are required in those pieces, the very, very most basic skills, playing with a good sound, and with good articulation, playing with good line, playing with good musical thinking, now become threads that I just go, okay, where are we at on this scale in this piece? Because this piece is always gonna need to get better, and the skills always need to get better. But that skill is always going to be there. It applies to any piece we play. And so all of sudden, instead of going, how do I make this piece better, I go, how can I make this skill better that we'll make this piece better? So I kind of change the priority there. Which, again, we as experienced teachers do something like that probably more often than we don't. You know, if we have space in our schedule, or if it's acceptable in our area to do some sort of fundamental skill building section of our rehearsal, like, you know, daily drill down here in Texas, we work on stuff like that. That's a very intentional part of what we do. And I think in in string circles, generally, it's not something that happens as often, but the language is not foreign, which I think is really interesting. So, you know, one of the things they talk about is, you know, the beauty of sound, and how musical something is like, okay, that's great. But we got to do this all together and go, oh, And a lot of times, if you can walk them through why we're spending time playing, you know, on open note or working on bow control, or, you know, frog tip to frog, all that stuff, suddenly it becomes like, oh, I see what you're doing. This is, you know, this is a skill building. Great. Fine. Whatever. And, you know, there's lots of things to cover in there in terms of how that manifests and like using the metronome and stuff like that. But I think thinking about this idea of threads or strands that run through our year can be a really freeing thing in terms of what are we doing at a given day, but also how we look at the whole year. So, you know, it's that Christmas concert is Christmas concert or winter concert or whatever we want to call it. But it is a chance for us to work on specific skills that we know we need to be at a high level in later semester, like in spring semester for while or things like that or for contest or whatever it is. And then that's really the main focus. Music is the music. It's not a material that kids like that they really want, but like we can be a little bit more fun. free as long as it satisfies certain criteria we have for getting better at the things that we need to get better at. And that's up to us to decide. we'll talk that through in workshoping these ideas. But the other aspect that I think is really interesting is if you think about planting gardens, because everything's growing right now, because we're getting interested in constantly. And so like thinking about this idea of like if you look at like the countryside from the air, like not Texas, but like places where they actually grow lots of crops. You see kind of the squares or sometimes circles, but you see this very boxed out like this is sort of and this is wheat and this is corn. But then we also know because we've been in the woods, we've walked around that most of nature doesn't really grow that way. That's kind of something we impose as humans. And a lot of times they just grow wherever they kind of this like vines or if you want to think of like kudzu, like just kind of growing wherever it wants to, are teaching the things we have to teach to get the job done. to perform at the concert, to get the kids to audition, to do all the things. That's very much like the units or those crops. It's very like, here's Wordstarts, here's Wordstops. all this thing in between. But the ideas that we teach, the core of what it is to be musical in our ensembles, and I mean that to be income is everything, not just playing with that name, but like playing with a good sound and communicating musical information through some sort of group consensus, that's much more like a vine. That's much more like that kazoo, that just kind of grows wherever it wants to, and it can be a thread that connects everything, too. And so that, to me, is where it's good to start thinking about this, and even just re-articulating what we want to do in those new words can sometimes shake some things loose. So one of the things maybe I'd like to do is kind of take an aspect of what you're thinking about. Take one small slice, and see if you can apply something, like this would be a connecting thread that leads me back to. to August or September or whatever you start playing. So kind of take a second to think about that. So I'll share mine because it's not, I don't have the chance to teach an ensemble, which I wish I could, Cameron and David do a pretty darn good job. So I'm not really needed. But that said, I do think a lot about this in terms of I teach a two semester course. I teach like a junior high version and a high school version of how to be a band director. And this semester, how to be an orchestra director. And so a couple of the through ones I think about there, like the big one I'm thinking about now is critical thinking without calling it critical thinking. Like how do I get the students to listen to or recording or listen to performance and not just go, wow, needs to be louder or quieter. actually think deeper than dynamic changes or the way they may listen to a symphony concert and think down deeper of like okay what skills are they demonstrating they can do well? What are skills they are kind of like some kids are there and what are skills like nobody has a really good feel for and so they can start to then take that and go here are things that work here are things that need little attention here are things that are a five alarm firing we need to think about and that's the thread I'm trying to draw through everything so that I'm drawing their attention to that skill of assessing and thinking through student performance in as many different ways as I can without it becoming overwhelming so for like middle school classes for the musical focus classes we do a little bit with ensemble what we do a lot with like individual beginner sounds or individual instruction like you would in front of a homogenous beginner class which Ariana I know does not set them up to work outside of Texas but it's those are the cards we're dealt but like in the high school we do a lot more listening to ensembles and I have a collection of ensemble recordings. from not Texas. I won't say where they're from, but they're from not Texas. One, because that way they don't know. And two, ensemble, some of them are like, they can do the ensemble thing pretty well, but there are some very obvious gaps in the way they approach things, and that's, that's fine. That's where those groups come from. But then we transition to like the YouTube postings that people do of their pre YLs, and we pull up like Henry Middle School, like we pull up kind of your more standard, like here's a second band at a double C that's in a pretty far suburb of this major city. They suddenly have, I hope, a lot more tools to apply to that, that even though the ensemble sounds significantly better than what they're, they've been listening to, they still can go, oh, I hear that thing in a way that will unlock for them as a teacher the ability to go, oh, I hear that here's how I'm going to go about fixing it. So that's kind of how I'm thinking about threading in my microfilm and my course. What about y'all? @27:00 - Andrea T. Maher One of the, one of the big overlying threads for us is, you know, our kids start in fifth grade and we have schools that are fifth and sixth grade only and they only have, well it's Ted Regina's. They only have woodwind class, brass class, and percussion class. And they only get together for a concert so they may only have a couple of rehearsals before a performance. And so when they come to us, then they have the complete opposite. They have full van every day. They never break up until woodwinds brass or percussion unless we have sectionals. So our, so in a lot of ways we say we have to teach them how to do band because they don't know how to be in such a large group of students. They don't know how to react. They don't know how to rehearse in such a big setting of 65 kids and then teach the ensemble skills that they've never been taught. But at the same time, I still have to develop their individual skills. So it's a, that thread of teaching them how to be a band and to be a band member all the way through the year. is kind of a central idea for all our groups and how do you like what are some ways you kind of deploy that idea of like how to be a band uh some I mean basic we start off the years just like get to know your neighbor because they come from four different schools and so they all come together from and I'll think that some of them know each other some of them don't know anybody in the room so just get to know your section who sits next to you what's their name um and that starts us into we'll let's listen to your person next to your trio and then okay now you know their names like don't play louder than Joe Smith you know so kind of we do that first just getting them to know each other and stuff like that to kind of build that and then we can build from there but it's an interesting process it's very different you know than a lot of places that start their own beginners in sixth grade and and you know all the ways sixth grade one con rose kind of singular in that organization like @29:00 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Asadina does something similar to that, I think, where it's five, six, then a seven, eight. But again, the scale difference between Pasadena and Conro is pretty substantial, just in terms of the physical size of the district, to speak of the size of the programs. that idea of getting someone else's things and having to work with it, I think that's a really good thing to start with, though, is this idea of how do we work together as an ensemble? And one of the things that's come up in my research that's related to this, but not specifically about, like, pedagogy, that bands are some of the only organizations that are the size that they are, that are perpetually refreshing. like, choirs can get really big, but a lot of times if they're not a tattoo sent to the orchestra, they're gonna be a professional group, and then that's really about it. But, like, bands, especially when you look at bands the size of the ones we have here in Texas, they're six, eight groups that have three or four hundred kids in them. The only thing that they, that's not a band, because bands, like, this all over the world, but the only thing that's not that, that isn't a band that's that big is like a samba school in Brazil. A lot of other places, music is done at a much smaller scale, it's much more like maybe 10 to 12 people, or a game like 24 to 20 to 30, but still it's not hundreds of people that have to do the same together. So this idea of how do we operate as a social unit and how do we kind of react? I love that you said they don't know how to react because it might break up just seeing how middle schoolers react when they don't matter react, and that is every way under the sun, sometimes not in a helpful way, more often than not in a helpful way. And so like I love that you start with that and that's really cool. And it obviously shows up in what they do by the end of the year and what they do when they get to high school. So that's fantastic. Ariana, how about you? @30:51 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So I love that she brought that up because one of my goals as I grow the program is to eventually have, you know, sixth grade is what it is. And then I'm afraid to have a high strings and a low strings class and then eighth grade the ensemble group. that way they're kind of, I mean, I understand that yes, sixth grade is an ensemble, but not really. But that would give me that is something that I see the band directors here do is that, you know, they didn't get that time to address a lot of those like woodwind specific things because they were teaching an entire beginning band of one block. So they use seventh grade band to kind of help. They split to help make up for the deficiency. But my really strong point this year is was really funny that you mentioned it warm ups. Like that is what I'm really going after because that's been kind of a battle for me is like, I grew up on the blue book. I remember when I had to buy a new copy and I saw that one of the authors died I was reading the back I was like oh my god what like I still have my original copy from the Jackson middle school band in 1997. But I think I bought a euphonium copy for personally. And I was like, oh my gosh. And so to me, like, obviously out of the band game for quite a while, but like, you have to warm up. And I've noticed it was for orchestra that's very split. Some people are like, no, you just start playing whatever. And then like you had mentioned, there's a lot of technique work to be done. And again, as somebody who does not necessarily have those techniques or doesn't think about them because I wasn't taught them, I just had to learn them a week before my students. So I thought a cart was going to learn me, sorry. So I've been really struggling with that because so many people are like, oh, I just take it out of our music and I turn something into a warm up that day. I'm like, that's great. I don't have the mental capacity for that. I've got eight classes that I'm teaching, three different courses, plus three levels of orchestra, like, I can't do that. And so now I have a cart coming, There we go. So I've been looking at for a warm up book because then at that point we're like, I need somebody to tell me what to do. I was like, I just, I need, I don't need an idea. I just need it written out. And so that's something I'm looking to start this year. And I'm hoping will be that kind of kickstart refreshers just to really have, here's what we're going to do today. Here's how we remember how to do this and maybe tackle things that I didn't even think about that I'm always like, guys, we really got to work on using our whole boat there. What does that mean? Well, we know what that means, but have we done that in contact? Have I ever stopped to work on that? Have I started a class like that? Probably not, because it's all chaos. And so my brain, I feel like with that shift, because I shifted the COVID year, that was the year that we were, I was doing chorus and band, or chorus and orchestra at the same time. Two different classrooms, buildings. And then, you know, we will help for spring break and everything back. And so I don't think I ever fully got to like grasp how to start class, which feels so dumb saying that like that was like my ninth year teaching, I think eighth year teaching, like I should have known what I was doing at that point. But because it was something different and it was something that was really complex doing both at once, it just never clicked. And so I feel like I've almost failed my students in some ways because of that, because of my lack of knowledge, my kids can play rhythm all day long. They're great sight readers, they can play rhythm, they're fantastic, but they're missing some of that technique work. so I was just planning that you had mentioned that because that's really like what I'm looking to really attack this year is if I can start that, every day as we go from 80 minute classes to 50 minute classes now, they're still every other day, right? You know, what can I do that can make that 50 minutes now, so that 80 minutes, even more impactful. What can I do that's going to last even longer in a shorter amount of time? @35:05 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, and I mean, that's the, the ever other day is challenging. It's even more challenging when you have ever other day for what would be a normal class period, the 50 minutes rather than like an hour and a half or, you know, some other schools get. Um, so I mean, that, that in and of itself is challenging. And I wouldn't be too harsh on yourself. I think any of us who are teachers look back on our teaching of X years ago, well, I really didn't do the best for my students there. Like I could have been better and, you know, we're all where we are and we meet the challenges we meet with the tools we have. And as long as we're trying to get better tools, I think we're doing the right things. Um, so, so be gentle with yourself, especially, especially since you were spinning so many plates and then COVID added to the Luby's order, which that's a part. Um, they don't want to have the Luby's by UH though, just, just so everyone's gone. @35:58 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) It is gone. @35:59 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) It is gone. lot that who knows what will be built, hopefully something exciting or at least useful. So, but thinking about fundamental skills, about warm-ups and this idea and like, you grew up, you grew up in Texas, right? @36:15 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Yeah. @36:17 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) like, you you kind of know the the the Kool-Aid we don't bring down here about like what warm-up to and how they function. And being around U of H, like, we take it to a ridiculous extent sometimes. I still remember watching Tom Bennett rehearse the Wind Ensemble when they were preparing for TMA in 2005. And like, it was the first year player would play an interval up and an interval down within articulation and everybody else had to figure out what the articulation was, like what the rhythm was, but also what the intervals were and they weren't the same, it wasn't didn't mirror itself. So, like, yeah, we can we can go all day long and play some Sundays thinking about fundamentals at U of H and personally that is where my happiness lies, but at the same time that tool of thinking about fundamental skills. So like, this is where I think maybe it might be good not to wait on the high school people to tell you what they want. Instead, go, what does it look like they do? Like, what are some things that make sense there and just start with that as kind of a proximal goal? But then also, and I'll send you an email, I'll connect you to email area to our outgoing string person. ACTION ITEM: Connect Ariana with Aaron Hansen, a former U of H orchestra director, to discuss teaching orchestra outside of Texas - WATCH @37:22 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) She's moving up to Illinois. @37:25 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Her name's Aaron Hansen. She's got a lot of great information, especially about teaching not in Texas. @37:30 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Like, she's done in Michigan for a long time. That would be awesome, thank you. @37:33 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) That's probably a more supportive sort of setup than what you're describing. But at the same time, it's heterogeneous versus homogenous. It's not every day. you've got all these different things. And she's very sensitive to people who are not orchestra people operating in the orchestra space in terms of that they need a little bit more support. @37:53 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So I'll connect you to get email. @37:55 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) But to me, what you have the opportunity to do is one, make the warm up something that is going to build that skill, obviously, but to make it something where, especially as you mentioned, like, you've kind of got a bit of chaos, embrace the chaos a little bit, let it break little but give the kids jobs within that. And, you know, maybe you don't have a ton of great student leaders, but maybe you have a few and maybe make them, okay, you go in this corner, you go in this corner, have no idea how big your room is, but like, segment them out and go, okay, we're going to do the first three minutes is getting things together and setting ourselves up. then the next seven is going to be these three exercises, Bob, you're going to lead that one, Julie, going to lead that one, you know, SMA, going to lead that one. And you just have them do a little like round robin and all of sudden, don't have to work on the skill necessarily. You don't have to be directly responsible for they're doing, you're responsible for going around and monitoring and being like, how's how's that going? And then you can kind of bring them all back together. We're fine a little bit if you need to then move on to do the next thing and maybe maybe maybe like peak days where it's like Okay, it's Tuesday. We're gonna do this thing and Thursday. We'll do this or whatever your a day B day looks like Because that all the sudden empowers the kids to that gives them a little bit in what they're doing and We know that kids are like brutal with each other in terms of their evaluation of others They might not say it sometimes they do in middle school But they have years they can hear things and they can hear when things are right and when things are wrong and the more we empower them to Not just have those opinions, but do something with them. The more we start to build their internal musicianship. @39:38 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) I think right. @39:40 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I like them That and I mean play around with that like make it super simple at first make it like hold this note still for acts or like frog to tip Over eight counts at whatever tempo marking works or strings So like you know stuff that stuff that they can get easy wins, right? And then you can start moving in to technique and doing the things like here's how we shift the third position that we do this thing and then maybe even segment them by the three instrument families. If you're in trouble club go here, you're in altar club go here and if you're in place club go here and if you're a viola and can't read altar club just go cry because that's really all you can do. @40:19 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Or you're me. @40:22 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I moveable clefs make me, I taught high school in the bassoon or trombone A2 to go into this I'd write letters then. I was ashamed. @40:32 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) They laugh at me. I'm like okay hang on CB. Okay this is an E or usually it's like the violin two-line. It's a little weird. But I will say something that's like a happy accident that I discovered I got a doctor beat last year. probably one of the only orchestra people with one but you know it's okay and accidentally switching it to like the beats not like not the straight quarters but you know it has like those rhythms that it'll play. Oh yeah. Yeah. And so, like, I would actually do that. Sometimes I'd be like, all right, do scale, let's go. And just doing their scales to whatever, you know, popped up on the Dr. B and they're like, Oh, okay, I can do this. I can do this. @41:14 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Evan, if you can find the tempo, and this is probably something you can do if it's like music that is danceable, look for the BPM and get a karaoke track of like something that's popular, this school of program, which that makes it hard. But like, hot to go, maybe is not what you want to do with them, but things like that. And put that as the backing track for playing scales. If you're worried about just technique and all you want to do is focus on that. when you're focused on quality of sound, take that away and go, okay, let's do this half tempo and really focus on it, feeling the same. But the sound being the thing we're doing and then speed it back up and do that thing. But like, I mean, the fact that you have a Dr. B means that your kids are probably a lot more accurate in ensemble settings than others because they're more aware of that thing. @41:58 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Right, because they hear it a lot. They're like, can you turn it off? @42:02 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) No. @42:02 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Not yet. No, not. @42:04 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) No, no. But I mean, and that's another thing too, though, like, and this is something we talk about in my undergraduate classes, but it's something I've talked about for a long time, because not being in Texas, I had to defend the metronome a lot. I had to be like, this is why we use it, and this is what we do with it, because people out, you know, in the broader world, and you've experienced it. know right now, maybe you have to, Andrea, the Texas is a musical conversation or the kids are robots conversation often centers back to what you have that metronome going the entire time. It's like, okay, you know what, if we're using the metronome 100% of the rehearsal and it's the day before the concert, yeah, we screwed up as teachers, right? But how else are the kids going to learn steady time, except through a metronome? Not to say anything of playing together as a group or understanding subdivisions of the beat, steady time does not something that we as humans do very well, just cool as a crowd clap when the fight song happens at a football game, like it's everywhere. And so, you know, thinking about that, though, the thing that that kind of has come to my mind is that, like, the, the metronome is a scaffold. If we want to think about educational terminology, or I also, we're just training wheels. You you need them for a while. And, and at some point, with the metronome, it's not training wheels because you need it to kind of give you a reference, but then it goes away. @43:21 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) You don't need it as much. @43:22 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) so, we as teachers need to have a plan for okay, here's not just how we're going to take out the metronome, like it's marching band. Like, okay, here's the first movement, no metronome. it's going to be, here's how I want to build their skill with the metronome, so that it's not that they don't need it. that it's already inside of them and they don't have function without the audible click-track thing. And, you know, I think that is something that maybe, I know I lost sight of as band director sometimes, when I was teaching, especially teaching the lower skill level groups, the groups that kind of need a little bit more loving care and the ones that maybe don't necessarily want to practice all the time. Um, you know, like it's a temptation turn a metronome and go and the more I didn't do that, more I was very intentional about when we took it away and making them do things on their own, like training wheels, the stronger those kids got. Sometimes they would, you know, jump up to the first band, sometimes they'd jump up to the second band, but we always started every semester with a conversation of, okay, this is the concert band and we have two other bands and you have to audition into those. My goal here is that you're not in this band next semester. You're not in this band next year. I want to see you move up. I want to see you have those experiences too. And you know, I would say probably 60% of them did, which for a community like Waller, where we didn't have access to a lot of private lesson teachers was not a bad thing and the band's got better. So, but this idea that you mentioned, Ariana, of thinking about like the metronome is kind of being a weird thing. I sparked that because again, that's another thread that we can pull on, of how to play as an ensemble because it's a related skill, but it's a different skill than playing by ourselves. And I think that's something maybe to keep in mind to, given both of you or middle school teachers, and it's something that's present in your mind, because you know, these kids don't know what they don't know when it comes to being in an ensemble. know they're sitting next to somebody, but what to do with that information is not intuitive. It's very much a learned process. ACTION ITEM: Implement new activities like fundamental technique exercises, circle orchestra, and scrambled seating to address skill gaps, boost technique, and improve morale and engagement. - WATCH And so kudos for both of you for kind of making that a priority early in your year. @45:23 - Andrea T. Maher Well, I think Ariana, I think you have more to draw than you in of like organizing your class. think, you know, you can still like steal from the band world where, you know, we do like 10 minutes of warm up, 10 minutes of technique, and then the rest music or some version of that. And you did that all your band life. And I think you can bring that to your orchestra class or if you ever had to do choir again, you can still use that same organization to your time. @45:54 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) And I think you have more skills than you give yourself credit for. Yeah, it's actually when in terms of how to structure the learning and I think that's that's a really key thing that we all need to embrace when we run into situations that are maybe novel. @46:12 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Well, thank you. Yeah, I think I let myself get overwhelmed a couple of years ago. Since I was just taking my beginners to assessment and I've refused. Which is a different conversation. But so we had a clinician come in instead and she was like first thing like you are an orchestra person. Stop saying you're a band person. was like, yes, ma'am. She's like, you are doing so many things. Well, and I think I just kind of. Because I'm such a perfectionist probably coming out of a Texas band program, you know, like. I had to be a perfectionist. There was no choice. There was there was no option. And so I think I kind of let myself get mentally overwhelmed with, like I said, what I don't know. Instead of being like, I do know how. to do this part of it, let's go. And while we're doing that part, let me fill in the gaps that I don't know and add it, you know. @47:07 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So I think we're all that place. Imposter syndrome is not something that only the other person has in the conversation. I can promise you that it is we are all dealing with variants of that. And I think you set this up really well, Ariana, because the kind of next thing on my list of things to talk about was this idea that was kind of made me like squint my eyes and have to really think for little bit, but then it's like, oh, okay, is that within all of this, when we're talking about instructional design and like where things happen and how to connect with pieces, there is a difference between teaching and learning. Because if we think about what a good classroom looks like, like you mentioned Ariana, this kind of chaos, like when we think of the ideal classroom, we're often thinking about it's quiet because they're attentive, they're making I contact their engage with something. And all those are kind of external markers of learning. But we also know for experience that those are always not internal. We're reflected internally. You know, even if they're like doing the thing, it's like they might be thinking about who knows what. probably don't want to know what they're thinking about especially in middle school. But this idea that there is a difference, they're related. And we often think one leads to the next without really having to, you know, make any further steps. But there is a difference between us teaching and the students learning. And sometimes that difference is in the way that they interact with the material. So for instance, you know, one of the things we know is that the learning modalities, the visuals and oral and kinesthetic learners is kind of not 100% accurate. Like it's everybody's got, you know, variations of that. It's not quite as clear cut as they made it back when they talked about that. But the way students tend to learn best in. and arts settings, especially performing arts, is by doing things. And so the repetition count is high. But then we go, well, what if they're doing it wrong? we're repeating mistakes, basically. so building a way that we can do the teaching, but then have a really, really, really, really, really short window or short time span before we can start assessing is the learning happening. Because the only way we know learning is happening is by what they demonstrate. And the only way we know that really robust learning is happening, really stuff that's going to last beyond that day is having them do it when they don't think about it directly. Like, they're just kind of the natural fallback. Like, we think about a kid, and you see that kid pick their instrument. And you can tell before they make a sound, kind of where they're out on their journey. Like, if they're, like, of pointing everywhere and they're a mess and they can't sit still, you kind of don't expect them to come in and sound like Chris Martin. But they pick up their trumpet. It's very intentional. And they set themselves up, if they make a sound that's more like Chris Martin, you're going to be a lot less surprised. And so that idea of the learning being their demonstration of the skill away from the kind of us like looking at them daggers in our eyes is a thing that we want to try and get to as quickly as possible, I think, as far as being teachers. And so, you know, assessment piece, we always do formative assessment, we're always listening to kids. But then when we have them, this kind of gets to what we're talking about with you, Ariana, is, you know, when they do things, whether it's really isolated skills or application, both skills to something in technique or application of all that music, how often are we letting them go, do the thing, try different ways, kind of learn like, you know, pre-ranked chickens, and then come back together to see if the skill got better, like, how often are we doing that? the answer is not often at all, maybe explore that, because that might be a way one, the kids get a problem. break. You know, they only want to listen to us for so long. But two, it gives them a little bit more freedom at a time in which middle schoolers love. They love to feel like big kid. mean, an eight-year-old who might as well be in middle school because she likes to feel like a big kid so much. And all of that stuff suddenly becomes less about the classroom looking a certain way and more about the actual product we get because of the way we let our classroom operate. I mean, does that like scare you this thing? Because it scared me when I first ran, like, I don't know if I am willing to give up that kind of control to the kids. Or does it strike you as like, oh, already do something like that. @51:43 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) This is what it is. Go ahead, Ariana. Sorry. Oh, I was going to say I do every now and then I'll do stuff like that. Or maybe as an ensemble, try something one way and then we'll try another way and another way and we'll kind of like let the class come to a consensus about it. But I've never- usually if I let them scatter to work on something, it just ends up being social hour. So I kind of give up on that. So I don't know if I need to be more directed, if I need to move around more when that happens, because I like the idea, which is why I keep trying it. It just doesn't typically work in my setting, which means I'm not setting it up correctly. @52:25 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Well, or it's just there are certain challenges you might face given the kids you have in that room. @52:33 - Andrea T. Maher Well, and like I've done this this was the first shoot that I've kind of done this. You know, we play through a scale and it sounds terrible as a full band. So I'll say practice that on your own for like 15 seconds and we're gonna try it again. I like practice on your own. And they do. They sit because I only give them 10 or 15 seconds and they'll practice that scale and we'll play it again and it'll be maybe this much better. But it did get a little better or sometimes if we go through a technical passage and eat. and that we're playing a real slow. I'll just let them practice on their own, but only like 10 or 15 seconds, because any more than that, then you might get Careless Whisper or the Haysong or something like that. So I've done that. I probably did it a little more than I probably should have this year, but like you said, it gives the kids a break. And they're gonna do it anyway. You know, if we play a scale and it's terrible, they want to play it on their own. And they'll try it. So like, oh, we're just gonna buy into it. And so we did that a few times and it seemed to work because I did it only for a short amount of time. Today I was in a clinic and they said something like, like Ariana, you were saying like, sometimes when you have kind of a crazy day, the David Puckett and Richard Alvarado said, embrace it and make that the one day you have, you know, sit by your friend day and everybody scatters and sits in a different place in your orchestra room. and we do circle orchestra. Everybody makes the big giant circle and play. he said, you know, that one day, you know, the kids will remember the fun of that one day and it'll, it'll pay you more dividends in morale because you embraced the chaos and you just went with it that one day. And, you know, he's like, make it better. @54:21 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You may not, but the kids will remember when they did circle orchestra or when they got to sit by their friends. @54:27 - Andrea T. Maher And so sometimes if it's too chaotic, like just immersive. @54:31 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) That is actually something like all throw timers. I use classroom screen a lot. @54:36 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) don't know you know that. @54:38 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) But since we're supposed to have our learning targets posted, then I didn't have like a rotating set of things or I'll have that on one screen, classroom screen on the other. But I'll set like 15 minute timers. Okay, we have 15 minutes for this piece. Find a new place to sit, go and we'll rehearse for 15 minutes. We'll, you know, address whatever new issues pop up because suddenly we're not coming with our section. And we can't hear that part. so, oh, it didn't go right. Let's talk about that. OK, minutes is up. Next piece by Denise Clothosico. And that's something that the kids really, really do like. So yes, I do love the whole historical playing or the scrambled seating. @55:15 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) That's all I've been And I think that gets us something that one of our graduate students who does a lot of presenting talks about where it's not so much about the pedagogy of what you're teaching and the technique. It's more about paying into the relationship bank with the kids as an ensemble. I see you. It's a crazy day. You're in middle school. You're crazy to begin with. Let's lean into that today. As long as we get some very basic things done, we're good. And I will make this as fun as possible. But then tomorrow, you have to come in and we're back to kind of doing things a different way. And so that it's not always the same flavor of ice cream. So I love that too. And one of the things I always did was talk about, OK, want you to do this five times. Five times. And then put your instrument up. And when everyone's instrument is down, I know we're ready to go, and you know, social pressure works on that, but they even within us, okay, in those five times, what were some different ways you did work on that thing? techniques, what strategies did you use? And like, I taught high school kids for the majority of my career, so you could talk about things in that kind of abstract way, but even like with little kids like, hey, did you play or working on scales? Did you play the mini scales? Did you play mini scale? Like the first five notes, and then the next five notes, and then put those two things together, like the two added monster on Sesame Street, and some of them are like, no, I don't need that, but some of them like, oh, oh, I forgot about that. That was in sixth grade. Oh yeah, and all of sudden they have this tool that they're going to use again, or hey, did you play that at Hack Tempo, or did you play that like in, you know, for the kids to get really bored, the ADD talented kids like, did you swing that? Did you, you know, did you play it like little two note groups and do your thing or, you know, whatever it is, or like the kids like, I played the the Arbon A2, or I played the Clark Study, so I gave you that. I'm glad you did that. You know, because then all of sudden, it's not just repetition for the kids that are paying attention. It's, oh, there are ways I can practice this that make the practicing improve me faster, you know, rather than just play it five times. And then we're done. It's like, well, it's going to get a little bit better. You get better doing the thing. But the more we can build these awarenesses in, like, oh, if I'm having trouble with this kind of thing, here are some tools I have. And not every kid's going to remember all of them, but if they're exposed to them, they stand a better chance than if we don't talk about them at all. And they're probably not learning them anywhere else. And so, like, to me, that becomes a really valuable part of, again, if we're talking about building skills over time, how do I approach this as an individual musician? And how do I bring that to the ensemble? I mean, that's level one level two listening within what Mr. talks about, but he's not the only one that talked about that. He just gave it names. So we tend to point to him first. But within all of that, too, I think that the way we think about ensemble. in terms of an individual's contribution to it, frames a lot of that. If it's, that's got to sound better and we don't talk to the individual, all of a sudden we're reinforcing, well, part might or might not matter and if I get it right fine, but as long as it sounds good overall, gonna be all right rather than, hey, we need everybody to be on the same level here. go practice that, be able to play it perfectly twice and then put your instrument down and like make it something they can do. But yeah, I definitely agree with Andrea that the time aspect of it is like, okay, you can do that for this many seconds or you can do that for this many reps and then put your instrument down is a good place to start to kind of keep the pulse of class going in. sometimes too, they don't need to leave their seats to do that. They can just be like, okay, here's, stop. seconds, which at that on your own or do that twice and then we'll come back and just leave them sitting in their seats. But sometimes that, you know, scramble seating, it looks like, you know, the rice mob doing a marching band show is exactly what they need. And it just depends, you gotta read the kids and read the room. But to me, to kind of close this out, this idea of connecting fall to spring is kind of something we talk about more at band, and especially in high school band, because there is a pretty clear divide sometimes between the way we approach marching band and the way we approach sit-down band, which I've never subscribed to, but I've known some people too. But to me, what this kind of points out, what these conversations point out, is that the things we tend to think of, like Andrea being in the six-day honor band room, where people are playing crazy literature at really high level, it's just mind blowing. It kind of makes you want to just hang it up and be like, okay, I'm never gonna do that, so we're done. Well, that would be me, because I don't teach on solos anymore. But within that, that's a secondary marker of achievement to me in a given year. Like that, it's almost like, how will those kids play a fundamental skills and ensemble is the primary marker of their learning? Like, how we play, you know, the... we play one or how we play this exercise that combines, you know, like a scalar thing with articulation and range and all that, like how we can make that sound as an ensemble, that's a primary marker because that shows up in the literature and it shows up at a much, much higher level maybe because there's fewer people doing it. But if everyone can do it at a really high level, we know that they have the skills and it's just a matter of getting their brains around how to do that in that setting. And so to me, this idea of creating threads and connections through the year is way less about how the literature lines up. think it's going to because that's the way we think and it should because that is helpful to the students, but it's more about how the fundamental skills develop over time. And we're working where we are working on those and I'm going to show up in the music or pulling them from the music and we see a consistent kind of group of them moving across the year. All of a sudden, we're achieving both the primary and the secondary improvement matrices if we want to think about that way. But another way to think about it too, that we kind of touched on a little bit is it's more about their personal accountability and how they do things, how students approach their instrument individually, but also then in the ensemble. That's a primary marker of learning, like how when they pick up their instrument, what do they do and how do they approach problems? How do they solve the problems before we as the teacher need to go and solve them for them? And given that so many of our kids come from either helicopter parents or what's the new one bulldozer parents or snow plow parents or there's all sorts of parenting that involves destroying the thing in front of your kids so they don't have to face challenges, we know that that's something they're going to need because the real world doesn't have that. You know, your mom and dad aren't going to bring you your briefcase at the job interview because you forgot at home, at least I hope they're not. So, you know, this idea of how they approach things kind of as an add-on benefit of, okay, if we expect these things out of them, over time they're going to grow into them. It's just up to us to be one patient but also realistic of, am I doing enough? And the answer's probably going to be, no, I can always do more. We always think that way because... these humans are really good at identifying problems, especially musicians. There's actually research out that says our self-efficacy, our thought process about how well we do things, he's in the gutter, absolutely in the bottom of the dumpster compared to everybody else, musicians in general. We have terrible, terrible mental health, which we as musicians go, well, yeah, that makes sense, but it's not just us, it's all musicians. So we at least have that going for us. And so to me, this idea of one patient on our part, also building these skills and students, that's a way to combat that. That's way to go, no, you have this power to do this thing. By the time you get done here, you don't need me anymore. You've got all the tools and you know how to do the thing. when a kid graduates from the Clean High School or graduates from the Woodlands High School or graduates from any high school, the goal there to me as a teacher should be that they can operate completely independently of their music program and still be a functional musician in an ensemble context. And maybe the Americans sound the best for the context that they show, but at Mediachi, they might not really know what they're doing, but they have the tools to go, oh, I hear that thing, so I'm going to imitate it. I know how this works in an ensemble, but I'm going to do these things, at least as a place to start. And to me, if we're doing that as teachers, on top of keeping them excited about music and giving them a place to experience the emotional release and all the cool things that happen in there and keeping them wanting to do that after they leave high school and after they leave college, I think we're doing a very good job. But part of that comes down to, what are the threads that we connect across that academic year and how do we grow those from year to year with our kids, especially if we see them in different ensembles every year? All of sudden then it becomes something where it's like, okay, here's what this level of the game looks like. This is sixth grade, here's seventh grade, it's this level, it's harder room. The sun is trying to kill you like it does in Mario. And then this over here, and all of a sudden we have these manufactured and these systemic levels. That we can just play within and see what works for our kids to get them to the places we want them to get to so I mean to me that is That kind of thought process is a lot more freeing than I got to do this piece by Maine It's got to be perfect and it's got it so all the sudden I have little bit more one freedom to explore things But to the the focus is not how can I make you know this piece? Sound amazing the focus is how do I make the ensemble sound amazing? While doing this piece like how do I give them the skills to sound amazing that we can raft onto this piece or whatever piece We put in front of them and I mean that's that's part of how mr. got his kids to play music for Prague in 1970 Because it was written two years before There are still some colleges that can't get through that piece and yet his middle schoolers did all that being said I know it's what partially it's the magic of it being green All of us wish we had in all this trying foster when we see it in ourselves But I don't want to hold you guys long because I know we went over last time, but did you guys get the materials that I sent out, like the summary recap and all that, okay, good. You'll be getting another one of those in the morning, and this tab and thing is way more powerful than I thought it was going be. So it does some really cool things. So I'm going to see if I can boost those up to and how I share stuff and how I'm documenting things. I'm learning the tool and I think it's really cool, and I'm going see if I can pay for it for me. We'll see. @1:05:32 - Andrea T. Maher I'm not holding my breath, but... @1:05:34 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) All right. Well, thank you guys so much, and I hope you have a great rest of your evening, and I will see you next week.",

                "content": "﻿Ensemble Director Refresh - July 25, 2024 VIEW RECORDING - 66 mins (No highlights) Meeting Overview In the session on connecting spring to fall curriculum, educators discussed innovative approaches to create a more cohesive and effective learning experience throughout the academic year. The focus shifted from disconnected units based solely on performance literature to overarching \"threads\" or \"strands\" of fundamental musical skills that span the entire year. This approach emphasizes active learning, with students demonstrating skills through application rather than passive instruction. To build student ownership and accountability, strategies such as short individual practice times during rehearsals, student-led warm-ups, and scrambled seating arrangements were proposed. The goal is to develop students' problem-solving abilities and musical independence. Implementation ideas include identifying core skill threads (like tone, articulation, and ensemble playing) that apply across all literature, incorporating structured \"chaos\" to boost engagement, using short timed practice sessions, and having students explain their practice strategies. By framing ensemble improvement in terms of individual contributions and accountability, educators aim to create a curriculum that goes beyond performance obligations, fosters musical independence, and prepares students to be mature, skilled performers after graduating. The key to this approach is consistently revisiting fundamental skills across all literature while gradually empowering students to take ownership of their musical development, providing flexibility in repertoire selection while systematically building transferable core abilities. Key Takeaways * Instead of teaching in disconnected units based solely on performance literature, the group discussed having overarching \"threads\" or \"strands\" of fundamental musical skills (tone, articulation, ensemble playing, etc.) that span the entire academic year. * These skill threads would be revisited consistently across any literature studied, providing a cohesive focus beyond just performance obligations. * There was an emphasis on students actively demonstrating learning through the application of skills, not just being taught techniques by the teacher. * Strategies were explored for giving students ownership, such as short individual practice times, having them lead warmups, scrambling seating, etc. This builds personal accountability. * The group highlighted the difference between teaching techniques and actual learning when students can independently apply those techniques. * A key goal was developing students' problem-solving ability as musicians, preparing them for independence after graduating from the music program. Topics Curriculum Threads/Strands The traditional approach of teaching disconnected units based on performance literature was challenged. Instead, the group advocated for identifying overarching \"threads\" or \"strands\" of fundamental musical skills that could connect all the literature studied throughout the year. These fundamental skills, such as tone production, articulation, ensemble playing, sight-reading, etc., apply to any piece of music. By consistently revisiting and developing these skills across all literature, students would build a strong musical foundation rather than just preparing separate concert programs. This thread-based approach provides more flexibility in choosing literature while systematically developing core abilities that transfer to any music. It gives the curriculum a cohesive focus beyond just performance obligations. Application of Learning Simply teaching techniques is not enough - students must have opportunities to actively apply those skills individually, away from the teacher's observation. This independent application demonstrates true learning has occurred beyond just being taught. Strategies were discussed for facilitating this, such as: * Giving students short individual practice times during rehearsals to work on skills * Having students lead warmup exercises * Scrambling the ensemble's seating to create new listening environments This helps build students' personal accountability as musicians and problem-solving abilities since the teacher is not constantly watching over them. Challenges in Connecting Fall/Spring The educators shared the challenges they face in trying to connect the fall and spring semesters cohesively: * Andrea (who is planning to submit for honor band) has to balance preparing very difficult UIL contest literature for the spring while still making time for more engaging/fun music for concerts. * Ariana, coming from a band background, sometimes struggles to identify which fundamental string technique skills to prioritize teaching her orchestra students. * The constant demands of performances can make it difficult to maintain a consistent focus on skill development throughout the year. Embracing Structured \"Chaos\" While rehearsals need structure, the group discussed the value of occasionally embracing productive \"chaos\" or freedom for students. This helps build relationships and empowers them to take ownership. Strategies included: * Doing scrambled seating like a circle orchestra for a change of perspective * Using timers to give short bursts of individual practice time during rehearsals * Suggesting different practice strategies besides just straight repetition * Allowing these less-structured environments gives students a break from constant teaching while still reinforcing skills. Next Steps Some key next steps were identified: * Ariana will connect with an outgoing string faculty member for advice on fundamental technique skills to prioritize teaching orchestra students. * Both will explore warm-up books and other resources for systematic technique development. * They will implement short individual practice times within rehearsals, guiding students to use specific strategies. * Moments of structured \"chaos,\" like circle seating, will be built into rehearsal plans to empower students. The goal is to develop independent, problem-solving musicians who can apply their skills beyond following the teacher's instructions. It is crucial to connect the fall and spring with consistent skill development threads. Transcript @7:15 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) But okay, done tap dancing. I think we've got everybody here that's going to be here today. So um, but what I was going to offer is, you know, I wasn't super happy with the quads that you got tried to get through on Tuesday and then like we ran out and time we ran over. So I changed the script a little bit today. There's not going to be a power point. going to be much more of a discussion based session in Ariana. know you probably doing bedtime kid things or dealing with kids at bedtime. @7:47 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) I'm actually on my walk because I haven't gotten to do that yet today. @7:52 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Okay, well, excellent. Well, feel free to chime in whenever. We are we're talking and you know, thing I wanted to talk about today. @8:00 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So @8:00 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) That again, I'm sorry. @8:00 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Were y'all talking about honor band? @8:03 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, we're just kind of doing the blow by blow Dawson high school one. @8:07 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) OK, in six, which, wow. @8:10 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, I mean, Aaron's going to have a year because he's doing Midwest. He's doing honor band. They're going to make state marching contest because of the area they're in. So he's going to need a bit of a sabbatical. @8:22 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) I think he should just take April and and may off and just kind of do his own thing. @8:27 - Andrea T. Maher Crazy. OK, cool. @8:30 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So yeah, it's a good time down here in Texas. @8:34 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Sounds like it. @8:35 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Um, but today what I wanted to talk about is kind of something I know we all do. I know we're all familiar with how this works. And so rather than be like, here's this new idea, I wanted to kind of talk through some of ways I think about it and then actually have a chance to kind of workshop some ideas and see what we think about this, this idea of curriculum as something that's not boring. Um, I don't know. if you're, when you came into the profession, if the vertical alignment thing was still a thing in professional development, I know when I started teaching in Keller and O2, that was like the thing you did in fine arts PD, if you weren't, if you actually got fine arts PD, you did vertical alignment between your middle school and high school and make sure everything all lines up, and it's not that, it's not what we're talking about today. That's so important, it's very tedious and has a lot of value, but is, again, tedious and not for doing things over Zoom. There's no refreshing about that. But the thing that keeps on coming to mind for me, and this has been something that's kind of rattled around my brain a lot and finally landed on something that I think I can call it a, like give it a name. And that is this idea of, we often think in units when we're teaching, like I have to do this thing till this date. And then I do this thing until this date. then we just kind of like look at all our performance obligations and auditions and things and work backwards, which is great because that lets us plan out a year. But there are things we miss if that's the only way we look at it. And it's unlikely that any one of us on this call only look at it that way, but there's a temptation, especially for younger teachers to look at it that way. And so, what I wanted to do is talk about kind of ways to think through the year or ways that I've thought of to think of through the year that might help one give y'all who are experiencing teachers more tools, but two younger teachers, they can get kind of caught in that getting slapped in the face every two weeks with something I need to do. This kind of gives them a thread to hang on to that at least in the midst of that, which is just part of a new job, they can still make forward progress on areas within what they want to cover. But before we get into that too deeply, but think about that. What are some things that come to mind for you about challenges that crop up when you're trying to maintain some sort of cohesive through line or some kind of central focus to your curriculum through an academic year? What are some things that are challenging about deploying the curriculum you want throughout your, you know, your hundred and eighty days in front of the kids? @11:30 - Andrea T. Maher Well, for me, this upcoming year is a triple C honor band year. And so, you know, I've already I've already been in contact with my clinician since May already looking at what's going to be our UIL program, whatever some possibilities, and then backtracking from there, like, okay, if I'm going to play this, what am I going to play at Christmas to help build skills into that? And to me, I mean, it's really great the way that works, but the downs side of that is there's no spring concert with like fun movie music and pop tunes and the end of the year like the musical reward for all this hard work like we go straight all the way to mid May 11th 15th with the same music the whole spring semester and and that's what we do but at the same time all the rest of the bands get to do the fun stuff the fun music and to make this hard lit this hard uil lit fun for the kids and fresh all the way from December one to the end of the year is is a challenge yeah I can imagine and you know with with that too like it's you can kind of paint it as like okay you're the top ensemble this is a cool thing we get to do nobody else has access to but it can be a grind I'm sure like what are you thinking through your program like what are some Considerations you have for what you're gonna play for that There's a piece called Helios on the great four lists that we're looking at and then we're trying to figure out What to put with it? We're actually gonna look at a grade three and see like maybe the old red mill or variations on Scarborough fair or something like that because in the past I've done a great five and and this year two really hard grade fours and It wasn't as successful as it needed to have men or should have been so You know trying to find that fine line of a program that's competitive, but also Really really good. It's got to be amazing. @13:44 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So It's a challenge Yeah, that would be a challenge and you know I think one of the things the honor band process does do like you said is it creates this kind of runway for you because you have to think back Through okay, this is the spring what I'm doing in the in the fall and have and that actually ties really well into what we're talking about today. But that's not to say that playing the same three pieces for an entire semester is not a stream on everyone, including the teacher. @14:13 - Andrea T. Maher So what about Ariana? Like, I'd be curious what your answer is being in Virginia. Like, what is that for you? @14:23 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So, for me, my big struggle, think, is that orchestra still isn't really my home base. So, sometimes they don't really know what I'm missing. If that makes sense, I don't know what are things that I should have done by now. last year, this past year was the first year I've had a group that shifted before they left me. Which I should be doing every year, but, you know, rebuilding after COVID has been really, really difficult. So that's one of those goals that I really need to hit. I need to be bigger on scales. But I think just trying to Trying to my, I'm still, I think it's a mix of not being familiar enough with literature and orchestra and general still, know, going on year six in middle school, but two of those years were COVID years. So not sure how much those count. And knowing how to push my kids, they're going to be by grade level. They're not necessarily by ability. Like when I was in middle school, we had a top band, a top eight period, a top seventh, and then a mix. And I just have a grade seventh grade and then beginners, beginners can be any grade level, which at least is nice. So trying to be better about understanding where where they are at the end of the year and how to catch them back up in August, doing that a little bit faster, I think, having a stronger plan of restarting so that I can be in a better place by winter. alignment's been really tough for me and I know that that's like he said it's not what we're doing but I really do like to the high school directors what do you need my kids to do that way I know what I need to have them ready for because again it says things that like as somebody who grew up playing oboe and studied to teach band originally I don't like I said I don't know what I'm missing so those are those big clues that I'm really looking for what do you need out of them so I can hopefully I can try to have them ready. @16:28 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Right and mean that's that's a struggle even if you do know the content area because you know like middle schoolers or middle schoolers you know they're consistently inconsistent but like how far can you push them and you know you ask them on a Texas for like well I mean they could play Dionysia actually tried real hard but you know at the same time is that right for your community is that right for your skill set like not every community is going to support the kind of time investment you need to place from those pieces and operate at that level right away and so you know, even your specific situation, Ariana, of thinking about like, okay, the high school is doing something and they're not great about communicating that maybe. But even if they are, like knowing how to connect the pieces from where it gets hard or where they need to be in an area that's still little unfamiliar and COVID kind of took two good years out of maybe three, I don't know how liberal Virginia was at that point. In Texas, took two weeks, it's fine. Pretty much, yeah. But the fact that we are, you know, still digging out of that and they're still kind of rebuilding the program is both an opportunity but also kind of an albatross. It's like you have that weight on your back of having to get that thing done. But yeah, both of these kind of topics I think will fit really well into what we're talking about today. So the very first thing I like to think about getting back to the study of units and things like that is, you know, we have obvious things we need to do in performing arts. have concerts. We have we have, you know, kind of this milieu of stuff that ends up on our calendar and we work backwards from there because we really want to do well in those situations. And that's good. But often younger teachers can turn into like months of the week like, okay, what do we need to fix today? Rather than like, okay, we're working on this long term thing. So rather than units, I like to think about threads or strands that run through my year. Where for instance, know, the second band or the third band or, you know, really any ensemble, but I'm thinking, you know, an ensemble where skill development is still very much a you can tangibly see it improve. The thing I like to think about there is, okay, what are our fundamental skills? What are the things we're doing that I can connect across anything we're playing and how am I setting those up to be successful? So for instance, let's say I'm teaching that that in varsity middle school band. So we're, you know, looking at a grade two grade ones, I think is the minimum. and for triple C, right? Or grade one, grade two, is kind of where people end up. By the time I left, brings up where I ended up, and they've since improved dramatically from there, probably because I'm gone. But the thing that I thought about there always was, okay, so we're playing this music, great. And we play kind of the stuff we can play at beginning of the year, that's dance of the C scale, cheer one, pretty straightforward stuff. by the end of the year, we're doing stuff with maybe two independent motives. And, you know, like, great locomotive chase might be like the big thing. And now that's actually was a stretch for my kids, but that's neither here nor there. But using the skills that are required in those pieces, the very, very most basic skills, playing with a good sound, and with good articulation, playing with good line, playing with good musical thinking, now become threads that I just go, okay, where are we at on this scale in this piece? Because this piece is always gonna need to get better, and the skills always need to get better. But that skill is always going to be there. It applies to any piece we play. And so all of sudden, instead of going, how do I make this piece better, I go, how can I make this skill better that we'll make this piece better? So I kind of change the priority there. Which, again, we as experienced teachers do something like that probably more often than we don't. You know, if we have space in our schedule, or if it's acceptable in our area to do some sort of fundamental skill building section of our rehearsal, like, you know, daily drill down here in Texas, we work on stuff like that. That's a very intentional part of what we do. And I think in in string circles, generally, it's not something that happens as often, but the language is not foreign, which I think is really interesting. So, you know, one of the things they talk about is, you know, the beauty of sound, and how musical something is like, okay, that's great. But we got to do this all together and go, oh, And a lot of times, if you can walk them through why we're spending time playing, you know, on open note or working on bow control, or, you know, frog tip to frog, all that stuff, suddenly it becomes like, oh, I see what you're doing. This is, you know, this is a skill building. Great. Fine. Whatever. And, you know, there's lots of things to cover in there in terms of how that manifests and like using the metronome and stuff like that. But I think thinking about this idea of threads or strands that run through our year can be a really freeing thing in terms of what are we doing at a given day, but also how we look at the whole year. So, you know, it's that Christmas concert is Christmas concert or winter concert or whatever we want to call it. But it is a chance for us to work on specific skills that we know we need to be at a high level in later semester, like in spring semester for while or things like that or for contest or whatever it is. And then that's really the main focus. Music is the music. It's not a material that kids like that they really want, but like we can be a little bit more fun. free as long as it satisfies certain criteria we have for getting better at the things that we need to get better at. And that's up to us to decide. we'll talk that through in workshoping these ideas. But the other aspect that I think is really interesting is if you think about planting gardens, because everything's growing right now, because we're getting interested in constantly. And so like thinking about this idea of like if you look at like the countryside from the air, like not Texas, but like places where they actually grow lots of crops. You see kind of the squares or sometimes circles, but you see this very boxed out like this is sort of and this is wheat and this is corn. But then we also know because we've been in the woods, we've walked around that most of nature doesn't really grow that way. That's kind of something we impose as humans. And a lot of times they just grow wherever they kind of this like vines or if you want to think of like kudzu, like just kind of growing wherever it wants to, are teaching the things we have to teach to get the job done. to perform at the concert, to get the kids to audition, to do all the things. That's very much like the units or those crops. It's very like, here's Wordstarts, here's Wordstops. all this thing in between. But the ideas that we teach, the core of what it is to be musical in our ensembles, and I mean that to be income is everything, not just playing with that name, but like playing with a good sound and communicating musical information through some sort of group consensus, that's much more like a vine. That's much more like that kazoo, that just kind of grows wherever it wants to, and it can be a thread that connects everything, too. And so that, to me, is where it's good to start thinking about this, and even just re-articulating what we want to do in those new words can sometimes shake some things loose. So one of the things maybe I'd like to do is kind of take an aspect of what you're thinking about. Take one small slice, and see if you can apply something, like this would be a connecting thread that leads me back to. to August or September or whatever you start playing. So kind of take a second to think about that. So I'll share mine because it's not, I don't have the chance to teach an ensemble, which I wish I could, Cameron and David do a pretty darn good job. So I'm not really needed. But that said, I do think a lot about this in terms of I teach a two semester course. I teach like a junior high version and a high school version of how to be a band director. And this semester, how to be an orchestra director. And so a couple of the through ones I think about there, like the big one I'm thinking about now is critical thinking without calling it critical thinking. Like how do I get the students to listen to or recording or listen to performance and not just go, wow, needs to be louder or quieter. actually think deeper than dynamic changes or the way they may listen to a symphony concert and think down deeper of like okay what skills are they demonstrating they can do well? What are skills they are kind of like some kids are there and what are skills like nobody has a really good feel for and so they can start to then take that and go here are things that work here are things that need little attention here are things that are a five alarm firing we need to think about and that's the thread I'm trying to draw through everything so that I'm drawing their attention to that skill of assessing and thinking through student performance in as many different ways as I can without it becoming overwhelming so for like middle school classes for the musical focus classes we do a little bit with ensemble what we do a lot with like individual beginner sounds or individual instruction like you would in front of a homogenous beginner class which Ariana I know does not set them up to work outside of Texas but it's those are the cards we're dealt but like in the high school we do a lot more listening to ensembles and I have a collection of ensemble recordings. from not Texas. I won't say where they're from, but they're from not Texas. One, because that way they don't know. And two, ensemble, some of them are like, they can do the ensemble thing pretty well, but there are some very obvious gaps in the way they approach things, and that's, that's fine. That's where those groups come from. But then we transition to like the YouTube postings that people do of their pre YLs, and we pull up like Henry Middle School, like we pull up kind of your more standard, like here's a second band at a double C that's in a pretty far suburb of this major city. They suddenly have, I hope, a lot more tools to apply to that, that even though the ensemble sounds significantly better than what they're, they've been listening to, they still can go, oh, I hear that thing in a way that will unlock for them as a teacher the ability to go, oh, I hear that here's how I'm going to go about fixing it. So that's kind of how I'm thinking about threading in my microfilm and my course. What about y'all? @27:00 - Andrea T. Maher One of the, one of the big overlying threads for us is, you know, our kids start in fifth grade and we have schools that are fifth and sixth grade only and they only have, well it's Ted Regina's. They only have woodwind class, brass class, and percussion class. And they only get together for a concert so they may only have a couple of rehearsals before a performance. And so when they come to us, then they have the complete opposite. They have full van every day. They never break up until woodwinds brass or percussion unless we have sectionals. So our, so in a lot of ways we say we have to teach them how to do band because they don't know how to be in such a large group of students. They don't know how to react. They don't know how to rehearse in such a big setting of 65 kids and then teach the ensemble skills that they've never been taught. But at the same time, I still have to develop their individual skills. So it's a, that thread of teaching them how to be a band and to be a band member all the way through the year. is kind of a central idea for all our groups and how do you like what are some ways you kind of deploy that idea of like how to be a band uh some I mean basic we start off the years just like get to know your neighbor because they come from four different schools and so they all come together from and I'll think that some of them know each other some of them don't know anybody in the room so just get to know your section who sits next to you what's their name um and that starts us into we'll let's listen to your person next to your trio and then okay now you know their names like don't play louder than Joe Smith you know so kind of we do that first just getting them to know each other and stuff like that to kind of build that and then we can build from there but it's an interesting process it's very different you know than a lot of places that start their own beginners in sixth grade and and you know all the ways sixth grade one con rose kind of singular in that organization like @29:00 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Asadina does something similar to that, I think, where it's five, six, then a seven, eight. But again, the scale difference between Pasadena and Conro is pretty substantial, just in terms of the physical size of the district, to speak of the size of the programs. that idea of getting someone else's things and having to work with it, I think that's a really good thing to start with, though, is this idea of how do we work together as an ensemble? And one of the things that's come up in my research that's related to this, but not specifically about, like, pedagogy, that bands are some of the only organizations that are the size that they are, that are perpetually refreshing. like, choirs can get really big, but a lot of times if they're not a tattoo sent to the orchestra, they're gonna be a professional group, and then that's really about it. But, like, bands, especially when you look at bands the size of the ones we have here in Texas, they're six, eight groups that have three or four hundred kids in them. The only thing that they, that's not a band, because bands, like, this all over the world, but the only thing that's not that, that isn't a band that's that big is like a samba school in Brazil. A lot of other places, music is done at a much smaller scale, it's much more like maybe 10 to 12 people, or a game like 24 to 20 to 30, but still it's not hundreds of people that have to do the same together. So this idea of how do we operate as a social unit and how do we kind of react? I love that you said they don't know how to react because it might break up just seeing how middle schoolers react when they don't matter react, and that is every way under the sun, sometimes not in a helpful way, more often than not in a helpful way. And so like I love that you start with that and that's really cool. And it obviously shows up in what they do by the end of the year and what they do when they get to high school. So that's fantastic. Ariana, how about you? @30:51 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So I love that she brought that up because one of my goals as I grow the program is to eventually have, you know, sixth grade is what it is. And then I'm afraid to have a high strings and a low strings class and then eighth grade the ensemble group. that way they're kind of, I mean, I understand that yes, sixth grade is an ensemble, but not really. But that would give me that is something that I see the band directors here do is that, you know, they didn't get that time to address a lot of those like woodwind specific things because they were teaching an entire beginning band of one block. So they use seventh grade band to kind of help. They split to help make up for the deficiency. But my really strong point this year is was really funny that you mentioned it warm ups. Like that is what I'm really going after because that's been kind of a battle for me is like, I grew up on the blue book. I remember when I had to buy a new copy and I saw that one of the authors died I was reading the back I was like oh my god what like I still have my original copy from the Jackson middle school band in 1997. But I think I bought a euphonium copy for personally. And I was like, oh my gosh. And so to me, like, obviously out of the band game for quite a while, but like, you have to warm up. And I've noticed it was for orchestra that's very split. Some people are like, no, you just start playing whatever. And then like you had mentioned, there's a lot of technique work to be done. And again, as somebody who does not necessarily have those techniques or doesn't think about them because I wasn't taught them, I just had to learn them a week before my students. So I thought a cart was going to learn me, sorry. So I've been really struggling with that because so many people are like, oh, I just take it out of our music and I turn something into a warm up that day. I'm like, that's great. I don't have the mental capacity for that. I've got eight classes that I'm teaching, three different courses, plus three levels of orchestra, like, I can't do that. And so now I have a cart coming, There we go. So I've been looking at for a warm up book because then at that point we're like, I need somebody to tell me what to do. I was like, I just, I need, I don't need an idea. I just need it written out. And so that's something I'm looking to start this year. And I'm hoping will be that kind of kickstart refreshers just to really have, here's what we're going to do today. Here's how we remember how to do this and maybe tackle things that I didn't even think about that I'm always like, guys, we really got to work on using our whole boat there. What does that mean? Well, we know what that means, but have we done that in contact? Have I ever stopped to work on that? Have I started a class like that? Probably not, because it's all chaos. And so my brain, I feel like with that shift, because I shifted the COVID year, that was the year that we were, I was doing chorus and band, or chorus and orchestra at the same time. Two different classrooms, buildings. And then, you know, we will help for spring break and everything back. And so I don't think I ever fully got to like grasp how to start class, which feels so dumb saying that like that was like my ninth year teaching, I think eighth year teaching, like I should have known what I was doing at that point. But because it was something different and it was something that was really complex doing both at once, it just never clicked. And so I feel like I've almost failed my students in some ways because of that, because of my lack of knowledge, my kids can play rhythm all day long. They're great sight readers, they can play rhythm, they're fantastic, but they're missing some of that technique work. so I was just planning that you had mentioned that because that's really like what I'm looking to really attack this year is if I can start that, every day as we go from 80 minute classes to 50 minute classes now, they're still every other day, right? You know, what can I do that can make that 50 minutes now, so that 80 minutes, even more impactful. What can I do that's going to last even longer in a shorter amount of time? @35:05 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Yeah, and I mean, that's the, the ever other day is challenging. It's even more challenging when you have ever other day for what would be a normal class period, the 50 minutes rather than like an hour and a half or, you know, some other schools get. Um, so I mean, that, that in and of itself is challenging. And I wouldn't be too harsh on yourself. I think any of us who are teachers look back on our teaching of X years ago, well, I really didn't do the best for my students there. Like I could have been better and, you know, we're all where we are and we meet the challenges we meet with the tools we have. And as long as we're trying to get better tools, I think we're doing the right things. Um, so, so be gentle with yourself, especially, especially since you were spinning so many plates and then COVID added to the Luby's order, which that's a part. Um, they don't want to have the Luby's by UH though, just, just so everyone's gone. @35:58 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) It is gone. @35:59 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) It is gone. lot that who knows what will be built, hopefully something exciting or at least useful. So, but thinking about fundamental skills, about warm-ups and this idea and like, you grew up, you grew up in Texas, right? @36:15 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Yeah. @36:17 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) like, you you kind of know the the the Kool-Aid we don't bring down here about like what warm-up to and how they function. And being around U of H, like, we take it to a ridiculous extent sometimes. I still remember watching Tom Bennett rehearse the Wind Ensemble when they were preparing for TMA in 2005. And like, it was the first year player would play an interval up and an interval down within articulation and everybody else had to figure out what the articulation was, like what the rhythm was, but also what the intervals were and they weren't the same, it wasn't didn't mirror itself. So, like, yeah, we can we can go all day long and play some Sundays thinking about fundamentals at U of H and personally that is where my happiness lies, but at the same time that tool of thinking about fundamental skills. So like, this is where I think maybe it might be good not to wait on the high school people to tell you what they want. Instead, go, what does it look like they do? Like, what are some things that make sense there and just start with that as kind of a proximal goal? But then also, and I'll send you an email, I'll connect you to email area to our outgoing string person. ACTION ITEM: Connect Ariana with Aaron Hansen, a former U of H orchestra director, to discuss teaching orchestra outside of Texas - WATCH @37:22 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) She's moving up to Illinois. @37:25 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Her name's Aaron Hansen. She's got a lot of great information, especially about teaching not in Texas. @37:30 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Like, she's done in Michigan for a long time. That would be awesome, thank you. @37:33 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) That's probably a more supportive sort of setup than what you're describing. But at the same time, it's heterogeneous versus homogenous. It's not every day. you've got all these different things. And she's very sensitive to people who are not orchestra people operating in the orchestra space in terms of that they need a little bit more support. @37:53 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) So I'll connect you to get email. @37:55 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) But to me, what you have the opportunity to do is one, make the warm up something that is going to build that skill, obviously, but to make it something where, especially as you mentioned, like, you've kind of got a bit of chaos, embrace the chaos a little bit, let it break little but give the kids jobs within that. And, you know, maybe you don't have a ton of great student leaders, but maybe you have a few and maybe make them, okay, you go in this corner, you go in this corner, have no idea how big your room is, but like, segment them out and go, okay, we're going to do the first three minutes is getting things together and setting ourselves up. then the next seven is going to be these three exercises, Bob, you're going to lead that one, Julie, going to lead that one, you know, SMA, going to lead that one. And you just have them do a little like round robin and all of sudden, don't have to work on the skill necessarily. You don't have to be directly responsible for they're doing, you're responsible for going around and monitoring and being like, how's how's that going? And then you can kind of bring them all back together. We're fine a little bit if you need to then move on to do the next thing and maybe maybe maybe like peak days where it's like Okay, it's Tuesday. We're gonna do this thing and Thursday. We'll do this or whatever your a day B day looks like Because that all the sudden empowers the kids to that gives them a little bit in what they're doing and We know that kids are like brutal with each other in terms of their evaluation of others They might not say it sometimes they do in middle school But they have years they can hear things and they can hear when things are right and when things are wrong and the more we empower them to Not just have those opinions, but do something with them. The more we start to build their internal musicianship. @39:38 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) I think right. @39:40 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I like them That and I mean play around with that like make it super simple at first make it like hold this note still for acts or like frog to tip Over eight counts at whatever tempo marking works or strings So like you know stuff that stuff that they can get easy wins, right? And then you can start moving in to technique and doing the things like here's how we shift the third position that we do this thing and then maybe even segment them by the three instrument families. If you're in trouble club go here, you're in altar club go here and if you're in place club go here and if you're a viola and can't read altar club just go cry because that's really all you can do. @40:19 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Or you're me. @40:22 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) I moveable clefs make me, I taught high school in the bassoon or trombone A2 to go into this I'd write letters then. I was ashamed. @40:32 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) They laugh at me. I'm like okay hang on CB. Okay this is an E or usually it's like the violin two-line. It's a little weird. But I will say something that's like a happy accident that I discovered I got a doctor beat last year. probably one of the only orchestra people with one but you know it's okay and accidentally switching it to like the beats not like not the straight quarters but you know it has like those rhythms that it'll play. Oh yeah. Yeah. And so, like, I would actually do that. Sometimes I'd be like, all right, do scale, let's go. And just doing their scales to whatever, you know, popped up on the Dr. B and they're like, Oh, okay, I can do this. I can do this. @41:14 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Evan, if you can find the tempo, and this is probably something you can do if it's like music that is danceable, look for the BPM and get a karaoke track of like something that's popular, this school of program, which that makes it hard. But like, hot to go, maybe is not what you want to do with them, but things like that. And put that as the backing track for playing scales. If you're worried about just technique and all you want to do is focus on that. when you're focused on quality of sound, take that away and go, okay, let's do this half tempo and really focus on it, feeling the same. But the sound being the thing we're doing and then speed it back up and do that thing. But like, I mean, the fact that you have a Dr. B means that your kids are probably a lot more accurate in ensemble settings than others because they're more aware of that thing. @41:58 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Right, because they hear it a lot. They're like, can you turn it off? @42:02 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) No. @42:02 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Not yet. No, not. @42:04 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) No, no. But I mean, and that's another thing too, though, like, and this is something we talk about in my undergraduate classes, but it's something I've talked about for a long time, because not being in Texas, I had to defend the metronome a lot. I had to be like, this is why we use it, and this is what we do with it, because people out, you know, in the broader world, and you've experienced it. know right now, maybe you have to, Andrea, the Texas is a musical conversation or the kids are robots conversation often centers back to what you have that metronome going the entire time. It's like, okay, you know what, if we're using the metronome 100% of the rehearsal and it's the day before the concert, yeah, we screwed up as teachers, right? But how else are the kids going to learn steady time, except through a metronome? Not to say anything of playing together as a group or understanding subdivisions of the beat, steady time does not something that we as humans do very well, just cool as a crowd clap when the fight song happens at a football game, like it's everywhere. And so, you know, thinking about that, though, the thing that that kind of has come to my mind is that, like, the, the metronome is a scaffold. If we want to think about educational terminology, or I also, we're just training wheels. You you need them for a while. And, and at some point, with the metronome, it's not training wheels because you need it to kind of give you a reference, but then it goes away. @43:21 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) You don't need it as much. @43:22 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) so, we as teachers need to have a plan for okay, here's not just how we're going to take out the metronome, like it's marching band. Like, okay, here's the first movement, no metronome. it's going to be, here's how I want to build their skill with the metronome, so that it's not that they don't need it. that it's already inside of them and they don't have function without the audible click-track thing. And, you know, I think that is something that maybe, I know I lost sight of as band director sometimes, when I was teaching, especially teaching the lower skill level groups, the groups that kind of need a little bit more loving care and the ones that maybe don't necessarily want to practice all the time. Um, you know, like it's a temptation turn a metronome and go and the more I didn't do that, more I was very intentional about when we took it away and making them do things on their own, like training wheels, the stronger those kids got. Sometimes they would, you know, jump up to the first band, sometimes they'd jump up to the second band, but we always started every semester with a conversation of, okay, this is the concert band and we have two other bands and you have to audition into those. My goal here is that you're not in this band next semester. You're not in this band next year. I want to see you move up. I want to see you have those experiences too. And you know, I would say probably 60% of them did, which for a community like Waller, where we didn't have access to a lot of private lesson teachers was not a bad thing and the band's got better. So, but this idea that you mentioned, Ariana, of thinking about like the metronome is kind of being a weird thing. I sparked that because again, that's another thread that we can pull on, of how to play as an ensemble because it's a related skill, but it's a different skill than playing by ourselves. And I think that's something maybe to keep in mind to, given both of you or middle school teachers, and it's something that's present in your mind, because you know, these kids don't know what they don't know when it comes to being in an ensemble. know they're sitting next to somebody, but what to do with that information is not intuitive. It's very much a learned process. ACTION ITEM: Implement new activities like fundamental technique exercises, circle orchestra, and scrambled seating to address skill gaps, boost technique, and improve morale and engagement. - WATCH And so kudos for both of you for kind of making that a priority early in your year. @45:23 - Andrea T. Maher Well, I think Ariana, I think you have more to draw than you in of like organizing your class. think, you know, you can still like steal from the band world where, you know, we do like 10 minutes of warm up, 10 minutes of technique, and then the rest music or some version of that. And you did that all your band life. And I think you can bring that to your orchestra class or if you ever had to do choir again, you can still use that same organization to your time. @45:54 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) And I think you have more skills than you give yourself credit for. Yeah, it's actually when in terms of how to structure the learning and I think that's that's a really key thing that we all need to embrace when we run into situations that are maybe novel. @46:12 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) Well, thank you. Yeah, I think I let myself get overwhelmed a couple of years ago. Since I was just taking my beginners to assessment and I've refused. Which is a different conversation. But so we had a clinician come in instead and she was like first thing like you are an orchestra person. Stop saying you're a band person. was like, yes, ma'am. She's like, you are doing so many things. Well, and I think I just kind of. Because I'm such a perfectionist probably coming out of a Texas band program, you know, like. I had to be a perfectionist. There was no choice. There was there was no option. And so I think I kind of let myself get mentally overwhelmed with, like I said, what I don't know. Instead of being like, I do know how. to do this part of it, let's go. And while we're doing that part, let me fill in the gaps that I don't know and add it, you know. @47:07 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) So I think we're all that place. Imposter syndrome is not something that only the other person has in the conversation. I can promise you that it is we are all dealing with variants of that. And I think you set this up really well, Ariana, because the kind of next thing on my list of things to talk about was this idea that was kind of made me like squint my eyes and have to really think for little bit, but then it's like, oh, okay, is that within all of this, when we're talking about instructional design and like where things happen and how to connect with pieces, there is a difference between teaching and learning. Because if we think about what a good classroom looks like, like you mentioned Ariana, this kind of chaos, like when we think of the ideal classroom, we're often thinking about it's quiet because they're attentive, they're making I contact their engage with something. And all those are kind of external markers of learning. But we also know for experience that those are always not internal. We're reflected internally. You know, even if they're like doing the thing, it's like they might be thinking about who knows what. probably don't want to know what they're thinking about especially in middle school. But this idea that there is a difference, they're related. And we often think one leads to the next without really having to, you know, make any further steps. But there is a difference between us teaching and the students learning. And sometimes that difference is in the way that they interact with the material. So for instance, you know, one of the things we know is that the learning modalities, the visuals and oral and kinesthetic learners is kind of not 100% accurate. Like it's everybody's got, you know, variations of that. It's not quite as clear cut as they made it back when they talked about that. But the way students tend to learn best in. and arts settings, especially performing arts, is by doing things. And so the repetition count is high. But then we go, well, what if they're doing it wrong? we're repeating mistakes, basically. so building a way that we can do the teaching, but then have a really, really, really, really, really short window or short time span before we can start assessing is the learning happening. Because the only way we know learning is happening is by what they demonstrate. And the only way we know that really robust learning is happening, really stuff that's going to last beyond that day is having them do it when they don't think about it directly. Like, they're just kind of the natural fallback. Like, we think about a kid, and you see that kid pick their instrument. And you can tell before they make a sound, kind of where they're out on their journey. Like, if they're, like, of pointing everywhere and they're a mess and they can't sit still, you kind of don't expect them to come in and sound like Chris Martin. But they pick up their trumpet. It's very intentional. And they set themselves up, if they make a sound that's more like Chris Martin, you're going to be a lot less surprised. And so that idea of the learning being their demonstration of the skill away from the kind of us like looking at them daggers in our eyes is a thing that we want to try and get to as quickly as possible, I think, as far as being teachers. And so, you know, assessment piece, we always do formative assessment, we're always listening to kids. But then when we have them, this kind of gets to what we're talking about with you, Ariana, is, you know, when they do things, whether it's really isolated skills or application, both skills to something in technique or application of all that music, how often are we letting them go, do the thing, try different ways, kind of learn like, you know, pre-ranked chickens, and then come back together to see if the skill got better, like, how often are we doing that? the answer is not often at all, maybe explore that, because that might be a way one, the kids get a problem. break. You know, they only want to listen to us for so long. But two, it gives them a little bit more freedom at a time in which middle schoolers love. They love to feel like big kid. mean, an eight-year-old who might as well be in middle school because she likes to feel like a big kid so much. And all of that stuff suddenly becomes less about the classroom looking a certain way and more about the actual product we get because of the way we let our classroom operate. I mean, does that like scare you this thing? Because it scared me when I first ran, like, I don't know if I am willing to give up that kind of control to the kids. Or does it strike you as like, oh, already do something like that. @51:43 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) This is what it is. Go ahead, Ariana. Sorry. Oh, I was going to say I do every now and then I'll do stuff like that. Or maybe as an ensemble, try something one way and then we'll try another way and another way and we'll kind of like let the class come to a consensus about it. But I've never- usually if I let them scatter to work on something, it just ends up being social hour. So I kind of give up on that. So I don't know if I need to be more directed, if I need to move around more when that happens, because I like the idea, which is why I keep trying it. It just doesn't typically work in my setting, which means I'm not setting it up correctly. @52:25 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) Well, or it's just there are certain challenges you might face given the kids you have in that room. @52:33 - Andrea T. Maher Well, and like I've done this this was the first shoot that I've kind of done this. You know, we play through a scale and it sounds terrible as a full band. So I'll say practice that on your own for like 15 seconds and we're gonna try it again. I like practice on your own. And they do. They sit because I only give them 10 or 15 seconds and they'll practice that scale and we'll play it again and it'll be maybe this much better. But it did get a little better or sometimes if we go through a technical passage and eat. and that we're playing a real slow. I'll just let them practice on their own, but only like 10 or 15 seconds, because any more than that, then you might get Careless Whisper or the Haysong or something like that. So I've done that. I probably did it a little more than I probably should have this year, but like you said, it gives the kids a break. And they're gonna do it anyway. You know, if we play a scale and it's terrible, they want to play it on their own. And they'll try it. So like, oh, we're just gonna buy into it. And so we did that a few times and it seemed to work because I did it only for a short amount of time. Today I was in a clinic and they said something like, like Ariana, you were saying like, sometimes when you have kind of a crazy day, the David Puckett and Richard Alvarado said, embrace it and make that the one day you have, you know, sit by your friend day and everybody scatters and sits in a different place in your orchestra room. and we do circle orchestra. Everybody makes the big giant circle and play. he said, you know, that one day, you know, the kids will remember the fun of that one day and it'll, it'll pay you more dividends in morale because you embraced the chaos and you just went with it that one day. And, you know, he's like, make it better. @54:21 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) You may not, but the kids will remember when they did circle orchestra or when they got to sit by their friends. @54:27 - Andrea T. Maher And so sometimes if it's too chaotic, like just immersive. @54:31 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) That is actually something like all throw timers. I use classroom screen a lot. @54:36 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) don't know you know that. @54:38 - Ariana Kramer (she/her) But since we're supposed to have our learning targets posted, then I didn't have like a rotating set of things or I'll have that on one screen, classroom screen on the other. But I'll set like 15 minute timers. Okay, we have 15 minutes for this piece. Find a new place to sit, go and we'll rehearse for 15 minutes. We'll, you know, address whatever new issues pop up because suddenly we're not coming with our section. And we can't hear that part. so, oh, it didn't go right. Let's talk about that. OK, minutes is up. Next piece by Denise Clothosico. And that's something that the kids really, really do like. So yes, I do love the whole historical playing or the scrambled seating. @55:15 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) That's all I've been And I think that gets us something that one of our graduate students who does a lot of presenting talks about where it's not so much about the pedagogy of what you're teaching and the technique. It's more about paying into the relationship bank with the kids as an ensemble. I see you. It's a crazy day. You're in middle school. You're crazy to begin with. Let's lean into that today. As long as we get some very basic things done, we're good. And I will make this as fun as possible. But then tomorrow, you have to come in and we're back to kind of doing things a different way. And so that it's not always the same flavor of ice cream. So I love that too. And one of the things I always did was talk about, OK, want you to do this five times. Five times. And then put your instrument up. And when everyone's instrument is down, I know we're ready to go, and you know, social pressure works on that, but they even within us, okay, in those five times, what were some different ways you did work on that thing? techniques, what strategies did you use? And like, I taught high school kids for the majority of my career, so you could talk about things in that kind of abstract way, but even like with little kids like, hey, did you play or working on scales? Did you play the mini scales? Did you play mini scale? Like the first five notes, and then the next five notes, and then put those two things together, like the two added monster on Sesame Street, and some of them are like, no, I don't need that, but some of them like, oh, oh, I forgot about that. That was in sixth grade. Oh yeah, and all of sudden they have this tool that they're going to use again, or hey, did you play that at Hack Tempo, or did you play that like in, you know, for the kids to get really bored, the ADD talented kids like, did you swing that? Did you, you know, did you play it like little two note groups and do your thing or, you know, whatever it is, or like the kids like, I played the the Arbon A2, or I played the Clark Study, so I gave you that. I'm glad you did that. You know, because then all of sudden, it's not just repetition for the kids that are paying attention. It's, oh, there are ways I can practice this that make the practicing improve me faster, you know, rather than just play it five times. And then we're done. It's like, well, it's going to get a little bit better. You get better doing the thing. But the more we can build these awarenesses in, like, oh, if I'm having trouble with this kind of thing, here are some tools I have. And not every kid's going to remember all of them, but if they're exposed to them, they stand a better chance than if we don't talk about them at all. And they're probably not learning them anywhere else. And so, like, to me, that becomes a really valuable part of, again, if we're talking about building skills over time, how do I approach this as an individual musician? And how do I bring that to the ensemble? I mean, that's level one level two listening within what Mr. talks about, but he's not the only one that talked about that. He just gave it names. So we tend to point to him first. But within all of that, too, I think that the way we think about ensemble. in terms of an individual's contribution to it, frames a lot of that. If it's, that's got to sound better and we don't talk to the individual, all of a sudden we're reinforcing, well, part might or might not matter and if I get it right fine, but as long as it sounds good overall, gonna be all right rather than, hey, we need everybody to be on the same level here. go practice that, be able to play it perfectly twice and then put your instrument down and like make it something they can do. But yeah, I definitely agree with Andrea that the time aspect of it is like, okay, you can do that for this many seconds or you can do that for this many reps and then put your instrument down is a good place to start to kind of keep the pulse of class going in. sometimes too, they don't need to leave their seats to do that. They can just be like, okay, here's, stop. seconds, which at that on your own or do that twice and then we'll come back and just leave them sitting in their seats. But sometimes that, you know, scramble seating, it looks like, you know, the rice mob doing a marching band show is exactly what they need. And it just depends, you gotta read the kids and read the room. But to me, to kind of close this out, this idea of connecting fall to spring is kind of something we talk about more at band, and especially in high school band, because there is a pretty clear divide sometimes between the way we approach marching band and the way we approach sit-down band, which I've never subscribed to, but I've known some people too. But to me, what this kind of points out, what these conversations point out, is that the things we tend to think of, like Andrea being in the six-day honor band room, where people are playing crazy literature at really high level, it's just mind blowing. It kind of makes you want to just hang it up and be like, okay, I'm never gonna do that, so we're done. Well, that would be me, because I don't teach on solos anymore. But within that, that's a secondary marker of achievement to me in a given year. Like that, it's almost like, how will those kids play a fundamental skills and ensemble is the primary marker of their learning? Like, how we play, you know, the... we play one or how we play this exercise that combines, you know, like a scalar thing with articulation and range and all that, like how we can make that sound as an ensemble, that's a primary marker because that shows up in the literature and it shows up at a much, much higher level maybe because there's fewer people doing it. But if everyone can do it at a really high level, we know that they have the skills and it's just a matter of getting their brains around how to do that in that setting. And so to me, this idea of creating threads and connections through the year is way less about how the literature lines up. think it's going to because that's the way we think and it should because that is helpful to the students, but it's more about how the fundamental skills develop over time. And we're working where we are working on those and I'm going to show up in the music or pulling them from the music and we see a consistent kind of group of them moving across the year. All of a sudden, we're achieving both the primary and the secondary improvement matrices if we want to think about that way. But another way to think about it too, that we kind of touched on a little bit is it's more about their personal accountability and how they do things, how students approach their instrument individually, but also then in the ensemble. That's a primary marker of learning, like how when they pick up their instrument, what do they do and how do they approach problems? How do they solve the problems before we as the teacher need to go and solve them for them? And given that so many of our kids come from either helicopter parents or what's the new one bulldozer parents or snow plow parents or there's all sorts of parenting that involves destroying the thing in front of your kids so they don't have to face challenges, we know that that's something they're going to need because the real world doesn't have that. You know, your mom and dad aren't going to bring you your briefcase at the job interview because you forgot at home, at least I hope they're not. So, you know, this idea of how they approach things kind of as an add-on benefit of, okay, if we expect these things out of them, over time they're going to grow into them. It's just up to us to be one patient but also realistic of, am I doing enough? And the answer's probably going to be, no, I can always do more. We always think that way because... these humans are really good at identifying problems, especially musicians. There's actually research out that says our self-efficacy, our thought process about how well we do things, he's in the gutter, absolutely in the bottom of the dumpster compared to everybody else, musicians in general. We have terrible, terrible mental health, which we as musicians go, well, yeah, that makes sense, but it's not just us, it's all musicians. So we at least have that going for us. And so to me, this idea of one patient on our part, also building these skills and students, that's a way to combat that. That's way to go, no, you have this power to do this thing. By the time you get done here, you don't need me anymore. You've got all the tools and you know how to do the thing. when a kid graduates from the Clean High School or graduates from the Woodlands High School or graduates from any high school, the goal there to me as a teacher should be that they can operate completely independently of their music program and still be a functional musician in an ensemble context. And maybe the Americans sound the best for the context that they show, but at Mediachi, they might not really know what they're doing, but they have the tools to go, oh, I hear that thing, so I'm going to imitate it. I know how this works in an ensemble, but I'm going to do these things, at least as a place to start. And to me, if we're doing that as teachers, on top of keeping them excited about music and giving them a place to experience the emotional release and all the cool things that happen in there and keeping them wanting to do that after they leave high school and after they leave college, I think we're doing a very good job. But part of that comes down to, what are the threads that we connect across that academic year and how do we grow those from year to year with our kids, especially if we see them in different ensembles every year? All of sudden then it becomes something where it's like, okay, here's what this level of the game looks like. This is sixth grade, here's seventh grade, it's this level, it's harder room. The sun is trying to kill you like it does in Mario. And then this over here, and all of a sudden we have these manufactured and these systemic levels. That we can just play within and see what works for our kids to get them to the places we want them to get to so I mean to me that is That kind of thought process is a lot more freeing than I got to do this piece by Maine It's got to be perfect and it's got it so all the sudden I have little bit more one freedom to explore things But to the the focus is not how can I make you know this piece? Sound amazing the focus is how do I make the ensemble sound amazing? While doing this piece like how do I give them the skills to sound amazing that we can raft onto this piece or whatever piece We put in front of them and I mean that's that's part of how mr. got his kids to play music for Prague in 1970 Because it was written two years before There are still some colleges that can't get through that piece and yet his middle schoolers did all that being said I know it's what partially it's the magic of it being green All of us wish we had in all this trying foster when we see it in ourselves But I don't want to hold you guys long because I know we went over last time, but did you guys get the materials that I sent out, like the summary recap and all that, okay, good. You'll be getting another one of those in the morning, and this tab and thing is way more powerful than I thought it was going be. So it does some really cool things. So I'm going to see if I can boost those up to and how I share stuff and how I'm documenting things. I'm learning the tool and I think it's really cool, and I'm going see if I can pay for it for me. We'll see. @1:05:32 - Andrea T. Maher I'm not holding my breath, but... @1:05:34 - Cory Meals (cmeals42@gmail.com) All right. Well, thank you guys so much, and I hope you have a great rest of your evening, and I will see you next week.",

                "content": "[Music] okay so i'm joined here by oliver berkman um oliver's the author of a new book called 4000 weeks which um i think is uh it's had a huge impact on me and i think there's some powerful ideas in there but however maybe to get started the whole book seems to revolve around um an experience you had in a on a park bench in uh in new york could you maybe tell us about what this experience was and why this was such an important realization for you yeah sure i mean i think this was a sort of an it was one of those intellectual insights that is really only the beginning of a process of coming to see things differently because it's the bit where it's the bit where you work it out on an intellectual level and then actually sort of living the the thing is a different challenge but um yeah i was as i have been for many years and maybe to some extent i'm still today what i refer to in the book as a productivity geek you know somebody really really obsessed with time management systems and how to organize the day and how to get things done and how to be more productive and optimized and all the rest of it it's a huge there's a huge sort of subculture of people fixated on these things and i always felt like i was just about i was just on the verge of getting my life kind of totally sorted out and get really sort of in control of my time and uh doing my work at the rate that i needed to to stay on top of it and making time for the other things in my life i was always just on the cusp of this but never quite getting there and this park bench experience was just a sort of small epiphany that i had on a winter's morning in prospect park in brooklyn where i you know i had a day coming up that day that was i think a bit more even more busy than usual the number of things i told myself i absolutely had to get through by the end of the day was even greater than usual when i was sitting there sort of scheming and trying to figure out what combination of time blocking and the pomodoro technique and using a timer and this what i was going to do to try to like finally make it through and do all this stuff and just being struck by the idea of like hold on like none of this is ever going to work um i have at this point i've been writing a column in the guardian for years you know and one of the things i got to do there was to test out vast numbers of productivity techniques and read all sorts of books that many people don't necessarily get the time to read and it's like so far none of them had i mean they'd worked in a certain sense of the word work but none of them had brought me this feeling of total serenity and mastery over my time that i was chasing and i suddenly had the thought like oh maybe i'm maybe it's not that i haven't found the right answer yet maybe there's something wrong with the question you know maybe maybe it's time to do something radically different and that was sort of the start of my investigations of you know how we how i and how people in general i think relate to time uh on a day-to-day basis and some of the sort of uh unconscious or semi-conscious emotional motives that are driving us when we're in this state of like trying to get on top of everything or trying to reach inbox zero or trying to get to the bottom of our increasingly ambitious to-do lists and all the rest of it so um yeah that was that was the beginning of something um i think the thing that it was the beginning of is still ongoing you know i don't think i've i've not figured all this out permanently and totally or anything like that it seems that you know your approach before it was all it was always around tackling sort of symptoms and trying to trying to manage things but the but the the fundamental paradigm was flawed and it was these sort of very deep unconscious assumptions we have around time that seems to be the root of the cause now one of the i'm trying to figure out you know what are the kind of key ideas from this book and one of the things that kept coming back a recurring theme was this idea of we need to confront our finitude and our limitations that seems to be very important and i'd be curious to ask you know why is that so important that we do that and what are the benefits of embracing our limitations and our finitude yeah i think that is absolutely the question that i'm kind of attempting to track through this book um there's a quotation that i used twice in the book actually from a psychotherapist and writer called bruce tift uh and i won't get it precisely right from memory but he he talks about how we all um kind of try to we do all sorts of things in life to try to avoid consciously participating in what's in the experience of being um sort of constrained and almost imprisoned by reality right so we find ourselves in this reality where we are limited where you have only a certain amount of time on the planet only certain amount of time in the day only a certain amount of talent and other resources to do stuff with your time and very little control over the future um so all these different ways we're sort of very limited and it feels at least uncomfortable to be limited in that way so it feels uncomfortable to think i don't know if i can get through all the things that people want me to get done by the end of this week or i don't know if the novel i'm about to start investing a lot of time in writing is going to be any good uh or i don't know if this relationship that i'm embarking on is going to be the one or if it's going to end in sort of uh acrimony uh a month from now you know you know all these different ways in which our our our situation as humans is kind of limited and constraining and uncomfortable and in some ways you can understand like the whole of the tradition of like old school psychoanalysis as being like all the things that we do and the counterproductive behaviors that we engage in in order to avoid feeling that feeling you know in order to feel like um we don't have to accept the ground rules of of being human um and in specifically in this context of time and time management i think anyone who is telling themselves as i think a lot of people are and i was you know i'm on a path to a point at which sometime in the future i'm going to have my life in working order i'm going to be on top of everything um i'm gonna i'm gonna have it all running properly and smoothly i think what they're basically doing is they're chasing a fantasy and it's more comfortable to chase that fantasy than it is to face the truth which is that you know we live in a world where there is always going to be more that you should be doing on some level than you can do uh you're never going to have that kind of control over the future things like relationships and big creative projects and all the rest of it are never going to be unscary it's all built in it's like that's just comes with the territory so um one of the things that i mean i'm kind of laying out the whole piece of the book here so if you're interrupt if you want me to if you want to move on someone in different schools take your time i think that um the reason like it would be okay to spend your life avoiding reality in that way if it didn't have any negative effects right who cares right but but i think what happens is and i try to unpack this in the book in trying to use time in this way and trying to sort of avoid confronting our limitations we end up um sort of postponing the meaning of life into the future we make ourselves busier actually because the more you try to process the more work is generated we end up spending our time on less and less of the meaningful things that we really care about so it's all really negative it's in the service of this kind of avoidance but it leads to a less meaningful life and therefore you know the obvious reason to try to turn and face those limitations instead is that that's when you see where you really stand and that's when you get to say okay i have all these limitations including the limited amount of time i'm not going to get to do everything that feels like it matters or even very much of what feels like it matters um but once you've given up that impossible struggle to transcend being human then you can say well okay so these are my limits and now i can actually use this time to focus on a few things that really matter so so to me the big benefit of confronting limitation is just that it it's about seeing how things actually are in in reality and the more that you can work with reality the more that you can actually use the resources that you have and the time that you have to build an incredibly meaningful life that makes a difference if you're always caught in this fantasy of soon i'm going to be in control then you never quite get around to doing those those things there you go whole thesis i think we can in the interview now um yeah it's it seems that even you know when we when we don't do this and when we make ourselves excessively busy by taking on loads of different projects this is almost just a way to avoid confronting our limitations and just to to postpone that you know that seems to be something that that keeps coming up um now yeah you mentioned there bruce tiff bruce thief is actually speaking at we were in the conference he's actually speaking this month so it's a small world there you go oh right but uh there's another person i can remember the person that you quoted in the book um but basically the quote was we best uh we best teach what we most need to learn and i'm just curious how he has reading this book changed you as a person yeah that's richard buck and i think you know that's the that's the rather flattering way of putting it is that you know um the the reason if this book is of any value to anyone the reason that it's of any value is because it i was writing the book that i that i needed to read um the less flattering way of putting it would just be that all books in this kind of genre of advice or self-help or whatever you want to call it um are basically just the authors grappling with their own issues um i hope i've grappled productively with my own issues here in a way that kind of is helpful for other people but it's not like i'm i didn't come at this it's not like i've figured anything out so now i'm going to graciously let them everyone else follow my example it's much more sort of where can we go you know it's sort of bewildering journey that we're all on together but but it changed me i guess just because um well for me as a writer anyway i can't understand what i think about something until i've tried to put it into book form so i think more into article or writing so it's not i think some people might think that the process here is that you sort of you figure some stuff out and then you write it down but actually the writing is the process of figuring of figuring out for me anyway so so it changed me in that respect um also it's just like a big commitment and so it really um foregrounds this kind of question of uh what are you gonna sacrifice uh how are you gonna use your limited time uh what's the best way to use the fact that you have you know only 24 hours in a day and limited energy and limited talents and and and so you know it's a big scary-ish kind of project that throws those things into into relief um i could talk about this until the cows come home but just one thing that occurs to me there is that was the discovery that i was much more meaningfully productive in the long run when i did not try to do more than about three or four hours of work a day on this book than those times that i tried to sort of power through to a full length working day of writing so that's a good example i think a simple example of where um acknowledging your own limits is actually a really it's the way to produce more you know um when it comes to sort of any work that involves deep focus i think i don't think many people can do more than about four hours of it in a day 100 um i'll be honest um reading this book and engaging with these ideas felt like felt like therapy to me it felt like a sigh of relief i was like i can breathe you know i can sort of take the pressure off a bit and slow down a bit and pick things that really matter and focus on those and i i'm not gonna get everything done and that's perfectly okay you know it's okay to sort of be in the midst of a bit of chaos and a bit of uncertainty and just know that i can only get a certain amount done in a day and that's perfectly fine and i can go again tomorrow you know um so i'm just curious after you know after you've written this book over um has your definition of what you would consider a good life changed at all has your yeah has it reoriented your value system in any way what would you consider the good life to be no after doing this um yeah that is a really interesting question i'm not sure i have a sort of i'm not i'm thinking about what i what i think the answer is one of the things that i tried to avoid doing in this book was um sort of offering that kind of laundry list of like you know these are the six things that are better to spend your life on than other things so time in nature and time with friends because i feel like everyone knows that you know and i'm not necessarily a particularly great exemplar of of any of them but um i think that yeah in the sort of the simplest way to say that would be that i think it did attune me to the meaningfulness of very small things and very ordinary things in my life it sort of disappears me of a certain notion that meaningful and is the same as extraordinary that you have to sort of do unusual things or reach particular heights of accomplishment or something like that in order for life to be meaningful and then a bit more subtly i guess it's just for me it's always been the question of finding this synthesis of being present in the moment which you have to be if you're going to ever value your life you're going to have to be present to what's happening right now with wanting to still hold on to this idea that you know accomplishing big goals and whether extraordinary or otherwise you know being on a being on a path somewhere is actually a important part of a meaningful life right so if all you thought you had to do in life was was just be completely present in the moment it would seem to nullify the idea of working on the project of writing a book or on the project of parenting a child or becoming a better spouse or anything like that you know and so finding how those two can overlap that's important to me because i don't really want to give up either of them it seems pretty obvious you've got to be present in the moment but it also seems pretty obvious i wouldn't be happy if i was if i was doing nothing but i mean quite apart from the fact that i wouldn't be able to pay the mortgage or eat if i wasn't if i was just um smelling the roses um but there's something important to a meaningful life as well about about you know working on things and getting better at things and things like that so i found more of a place i think where those two are both present 100 100 uh now oliver i'd like to talk maybe about some of the root causes of our dysfunctional relationship with time and for me at least it seems like this one of the core of these root causes might have been with the invention of the clock and whenever that happened and whenever we had the industrial revolution for the first time we started to look at time as an abstract thing that was separate from us that we could measure that we could quantify that we could use you know and beca because of that it um that's when this whole sort of the the problems might have started so maybe if you could explain that and explain that very clumsily some of you could elaborate elaborate on that a bit better and explain some of the other root causes of our dysfunctional relationship with time yeah no i don't that was uh did you say clumsy i don't know what was clumsy at all um i don't really attempt in the book to to say it was technology or it was economic forces or i think it's a huge mixture of technological developments economic developments things that are probably completely timeless in humans about um not liking the fact that we're uh finite and mortal but the so they all sort of they they all play a part and it's all impossible to disentangle but yeah i think the the clock and that the the pattern the sort of force the sort of changes that the clock was part of are all have to do with coming to think of time as something separate from oneself right they all have to do with coming to think of time as a thing which is the sort of the way i put in the book it's not a very uh not a very sort of technical way of describing it but like we just even without concentrating on this i think we just think of time as a thing it's a thing that like maybe you think of a timeline running alongside you as you go through the day or you're imagining a calendar or a little set of boxes or whatever your mental images there's somehow you and then this time and you have to fit things that you're doing into the time um you might worry that there's not enough time to get through all the things you and that's all very those are all spatial metaphors when you start to actually try to try to think about time something is strange about thinking about it in in this way that comes from things like the clock because then you can quantify it and you can start to think about it as this abstract entity and we sort of need to have that idea of an abstract entity in order to do lots of things that we can do in the modern world but it's also the source of a lot of our problems and i think that a lot of people in the times before clocks and in pre-industrial um cultures would not have had that idea at all of time as a separate thing it was just like time was the medium in which their lives unfolded um the example i've given before is you know if you'd gone up to a medieval english peasant and said who like a dairy farmer say and said um uh you know i read in this productivity book you should batch your activities because that's a really efficient way to get through them so why don't we do all the milking of the cows for this year in the next week to get it out of the way it's obviously completely absurd you can't think about time in that way moving things around becoming more efficient with it you're just it just is and it flows and you milk the cows when they knew milking and and uh and i think in many ways it would have been a much more peaceful kind of relationship with time because once you see it as this resource you then think of as a resource you have to use well becomes possible for people to you know monetize that resource and to buy your time and um and then all the sort of problems of overwhelm and trying to fit more into time than we have available all come from but they're all premised on that idea that it is even a thing that you could do all that stuff uh with but as i say i think you know i think capitalism is a big part of this and and the invention of measurement of time is a big part of this but also a big part of it is just that like we've probably never been happy about this situation of um of having limited time and so even in you know writing from philosophy from ancient rome you see people complaining about the amount they have and wondering how to cram more in and all the rest of it so it's a it's a huge mixture of things but yeah it all comes down i think to this sort of alienated thing where there's time and then there's you and these are separate things and very soon it turns into an adversarial relationship and you're in some kind of struggle with this thing called time i hope that makes a little bit of sense 100 yeah it's just it seems that the the second we entered into a subject object relationship with time that was that's a big problem um you mentioned the work of martin heidegger a lot in the in the book and his concept that we are time can you tell us about that and maybe um about heidegger as well because we sort of have to do like a disclaimer whenever we're talking disclaimer um i mean so there's two disclaimers actually about heidi and the one you're referring to i think is that he was literally a nazi for a number of years a card-carrying member of the nazi party in an era when this word gets thrown around in like social media feuds sometimes just refer to anyone you don't like it it's a you have to sort of stop and say like no no i really mean it um and there's a long and huge debate about whether that and how that should impact on our reading of his philosophy i just completely sidestepped that in the book i think these are useful ideas and i'm not willing to let a nazi hold them hostage basically so i mean i'm i'm trying to i'm i'm i'm trying to you know take the idea and uh and uh you know i don't care about the terrible terrible and not care about the terrible originator of them the other caveat is that i i don't think anyone is there's not i don't think there's a deep consensus on what he meant and what he was saying so it's possible that some heidegger experts would think that my use of him is illegitimate in that way as well but i think that the the gist of this notion which i do think is true whether it was heidegger's uh idea or not is that there's some sense in which being is synonymous with time uh i've since writing the book discovered that this is an idea that is very central to the soto zen tradition as well there's a thinker called dogen who i maybe ought to have used instead because he wasn't the nazi um he's so much the same thing this idea that it doesn't really make sense to think about our limited time as one of the various problems and issues that we have to cope with as human beings it's so fundamental it defines us so completely that before we even begin to cope with anything in life right you already find yourself here in this brief portion of time uh with your your biography behind you coming up to now everywhere you came from and everything that's formed you up to this moment is there you can't escape it you are time is moving forwards and you are going to die one day and you don't know when and you're sort of you're already you're so completely in sometimes people talk about time as being like you're on a raft on a river or something but it's actually makes seems to make more sense to say that you are the river um there's no you can't get outside of it or um sort of pause anything or sort of sort of get a vantage point from which you're not already in it so these are all just different ways of saying i think that um this this finitude this limitation of time is so fundamental to our lives that it that it's very hard to distinguish our lives from it uh and i don't know this works for some people this way of talking and i'm not for others but to me that then helps you see a lot of the things that we do the dysfunctional things that we do with time just on a day-to-day basis and you know including being a productivity geek to an overly extreme degree as this strange sort of um thrashing around in the in the river of time that we are in some effort to kind of get outside of it to um you know it's like um it's like the legend of baron munchausen trying to pull himself out of a swamp by his own hair right you're sort of you're trying to do something that is that makes no sense when you try to get on top of time or master time because if you already are time these concepts just just um you've short short-circuited all that so i don't know i i don't know if that's a i don't know how helpful this notion is for people but to me there's something really liberating and relaxing and inspiring and motivating in the notion that i don't need to try to get on top of my time i just need to try to inhabit the reality of it more fully a hundred percent there there's a few things to kind of impact there um just going back to heidi here so um i think you're spot on to sort of not throw the baby out with the bathwater here and especially in you know the culture we live in today that i think there's so much value in being able to separate a person from their ideas and just because someone has a has a questionable character because we're all human we've all i'm not making excuses for nazis here by the way but what i'm trying to say is that there's a lot of value being able to take a person's ideas without without their their whole kind of character as well i think that's important and then in the book you talk about how heidegger he's so difficult to read because he's trying to talk about things that are outside of our normal view like reality is constructed by by language to a large extent and he's trying to put things into words that are there's not a common language for them is that am i getting that right yeah i think that's right i mean i again i have to issue all the characters about my lack of professional expertise and you know but but yeah i think that um one of the things he's trying to do is to sort of so much of our discussion about philosophy and about all sorts of things is about the way that things are um what kind of elements there are in reality how they relate to each other what causes the other what causes certain effects and he sort of wants to get in before that and say let's look at the fact that there is being before we look at how things are let's look at the fact that things are and and then let's look in the specific case of conscious humans what it is for a human being to be i don't know if you need me to repeat these things when there's occasional um stray kid sounds don't worry about it it's all good um so uh so yeah i mean you're trying to sort of get in before the language comes and then clamps down and starts looking at um the specifics of the picture of reality and sort of pointing out how astonishing it is that like anything is instead of instead of otherwise and then secondly uh how how what it what the specific quality of that is this is for a human um which is this idea of being already in time and already as time um and yes so he ends up using these crazy phrases um uh that uh his english translators then you know translate in crazy ways as well i think partly it's useful because it sort of brings you up short and you've got to look at a phrase like being towards death as a noun phrase and and like uh you might not understand what it means but at least you don't have the luxury of just gliding past it which is what he wants to avoid i think 100 um i think another another one of the phrases that you use in the book is something like from heidegger languages language is the house of being and i think that's where we're kind of getting that here um now you talk in the book about there's a big mindfulness culture now and you know everyone's a lot of people are meditating and they're which is a great thing but sometimes that can actually sort of take us out of the moment because we're we're trying to be in the moment you know and you say there's great power there's great power and just really realizing that it's it's impossible not to be in the moment like it's impossible to to step outside of it whenever whenever you realize that you realize that um yeah you're always here if that makes sense even when you're thinking about the future it's always night and that can be something that's a bit freeing and takes off the pressure to to be in the moment if that makes sense yeah totally i mean i think yeah mindfulness and formal meditation is incredibly useful it's been incredibly useful to me but it's not immune from the possibility of turning it into another project that is going to take you to this perfect place of um being able to uh you know get around the rules of of uh the human condition uh it's just as much prone to that in some ways it's a little worse because you can tell yourself you're doing you're being present in the moment all the while you're actually kind of strenuously trying to reach spiritual enlightenment or something um and yes there is something really powerful i think in seeing what is actually obvious which is that you always are in the moment that worry about the future and regret about the past can only ever be arising as thoughts in the present moment that's an example to me of a realization that that has this effect of of uh bringing you more in touch with the place that you are and that seeing that that that you know you are time in this sense so it's always this i mean there are different words for it in different traditions but it's always this idea of that something is already true and you're sort of stepping more fully into a conscious experience of the fact that it's already true so and that i think goes through this book and lots of other books as well right it's not about it it's about becoming more conscious of what of the way things already are it's about a certain kind of realization it's not about changing things so much as changing your kind of um the degree to which you're participating in it and one the the reason to sort of see that you're always present in the moment is that it makes it a little easier to sort of do that change from being in denial to being in uh sort of cooperating with with reality instead 100 uh so another thing you talk about in the book is this idea of um of leisure and i think in modern society busyness has become like it's a symbol of status like people think if i'm busy i'm important you know but in the ancient with the ancient greeks and everything like leisure was sort of like the the thing like the ultimate sort of good like the thing around which everything else was was aimed and what are your thoughts on uh our modern approach to leisure because you you could take it quite a bit in the book and there's some funny examples in there but i'll let you uh maybe share your perspective on that yeah i mean i this comes in the book after a chapter where i've been talking about the sort of perils of instrumentalizing time too much of investing too much in the idea of time as something you use for a future benefit instead of participating in the moment now and how you know we all have to use time instrumentally to some extent um to get things done and to achieve goals but that when you totally invest in time in that way you're sort of by definition postponing the meaning of life to the future you're saying that the only value of how i'm using this hour is whether or not it adds up to this this thing later on and i think that's particularly ironic in the context of rest and leisure right to do that to your leisure time to decide that your leisure time has to be in self-improvement in some way or at the very least sort of recuperation so that you can go back and do more work you know to see leisure as serving some purpose other than itself is more ironic than with other things because it's like it's leisure it's the what what what how is it rest if you're if the if it's entirely defined as something for the for the future so this is the distinction between you know going for a run and training for a 10k it's not wrong to spend your leisure time training for a for an event um or you know all sorts of other things but but to do it exclusively is is almost uh again it's just to sort of turn leisure into work so i mean aristotle who is the source of this notion that leisure is the the highest goal because everything else is always for something else but but leisure is for itself and the benefits of all the other things you do in life is supposed to be for leisure i mean it's worth saying that what he meant by leisure i think was you know philosophy it was it wasn't uh wasn't vegging out but but yeah he he did see i think the act of philosophizing as as self-justifying and and i think there are all sorts of forces today that push us towards wanting to think of everything as justified in terms of something else and if everything you're doing is justified in terms of something else then you've sort of sapped the meaning from from life because you never get to this point in the future where you say okay now now is the moment of truth this has all been building up too i think a great illustration of this is the difference between rod stewart's hobbies and richard branson's hobbies can you tell us about that yeah um i was just really struck um to read a few years ago that um rod stewart turned out he'd actually revealed this on multiple occasions to railway modeling magazines that he that he has a sort of vast model railway set up um a really sort of intricate thing based on um based on a historical um city that's partly new york and partly chicago and uh he's so wedded to it that um i don't know if this is still the case but that he used to um sometimes request an additional hotel room for it when he went on tour so that he could carry on work on his train set and i think what's interesting about that is that um it doesn't it's very hard to see anything in that that knowledge that rod stewart has that passion that sort of helps his personal brand it's a little bit like nerdy it detracts a little bit maybe from this idea of the leather trousered gravelly voiced rock star um and it doesn't sort of it doesn't it's not profitable for him it doesn't help him make more progress like nothing it makes you realize that he must just really love uh model railways just purely for the process for the act of doing it and i slightly meanly in a throwaway line compare that with you know all the pictures that you see of richard branson kitesurfing and things like that doing other sort of daredevil sports i mean he may well absolutely love them i haven't interviewed him to find out the point i'm making the book is like it does really help his personal brand to be photographed doing those things it does have an instrumental value um it's not for me to say that he doesn't absolutely love it as well but it's easier to think that he's sort of doing that because of something else an image uh a sense of himself and and it's there's something very moving i think about the the thought of rod stewart tinkering with his uh model train uh layout um that sort of focuses the attention on how it it's kind of it's important i think that to try to have something in your life that you're doing for itself alone and i think it also flags up something else which is that i don't think it's a coincidence that the things that people do for the for for the activity alone which are things we tend to call hobbies are kind of they're a little bit cringe they're a little bit embarrassing it's kind of not it's not um it's not cool to um to have that kind of activity in your life and i don't think that's coincidence i think that things that we can't instrumentalize are kind of or that we don't instrumentalize people who don't instrumentalize every hour of their leisure time are doing something a little bit subversive and that is kind of culturally it's at odds with the the message the sort of driving direction of the culture which i think is also why if you can make money out of your hobby whereupon it becomes a side hustle in the lingo that's really cool that's like that's a that's a thing to celebrate and and and sort of tweet about and have a blog where you write about it but but pure hobbies like to just like to paint miniature figurines or to um i don't know uh any any any other you know knit or or or write short stories that you never intend to publish there's something there's something that is not cool about it and i think it's not cool because it is actually very important to well-being a hundred percent my my favorite activity of the week is playing a game of five aside football with some with some friends like and there's no there's no purpose it's just we just want to get together and play for an hour and yeah it's it's it's brilliant um yeah a perspective that you that you share in the book as well there are loads of different sort of perspectives in there that can sort of reframe your your relationship with time and one of the ones i really liked was this idea that everything is borrowed time can you tell us about that there and why that's why that can be a helpful view of time do you know what i mean there yeah absolutely yeah this is um some of the phrasing here as i as i do say in the book uh comes from a a writer and a blogger called david kane whose blog raptitude i really uh really rape so i just want to make sure he gets her excuse me i want to make sure he gets a credit there [Music] he wrote a piece that i mentioned in the book about um spending an evening on a row on a particular street in uh toronto where um a couple of weeks later um there was a there was a shooting um in which several people were killed um and having this notion of like oh like it's just sheer random luck that it wasn't that night that i was on that street and having this notion that like there is no law of the universe that says i get to be alive and to keep being alive and it's basically luck that um that that carries on and i think there's a sort of broader reframing here which is yeah we're back to heidegger and this kind of amazing fact that things are and that we are here we spend so much time maybe it's not everyone but i certainly have done spend so much time like objecting to the details of the way things are right now because um you know i wish things were a bit different or i wish i had got through my work or i uh you know i i wish i lived somewhere different or whatever that we that we sort of completely skipped past how extraordinary is that we get this i mean it's it's crazy this idea to be alive for a little while um and there is a kind of reframing here where you want to say well okay maybe life isn't really short because we are comparing our lifespan to you know implicitly to having him having eternal life or something maybe life is really long because it's all additional to what we had any right to expect i mean this gets a little bit uh obscure but if you sort of think of all the people who could have lived and then the people who did we're in a sort of tiny elite uh for having to act having actually got to um experience a lifespan and i also write in the book about a guy who i interviewed a while ago who's um who was close friends with somebody who died fairly young um and who found himself after that you know stuck in traffic thinking wow what would my friend have given to be in this traffic jam or in a queue at the supermarket like what would he have given to be in this queue and this kind of really extraordinary kind of gratitude where you suddenly think it kind of most of the time doesn't really matter so much what is going on in life if you can hold a bit of your focus on this idea that that life is going on that's kind of extraordinary and then just finally i think it also changes the equation when it comes to tough choices with time and thinking like well i'd really like to pursue this career but i also want to use this one i'm going to have to make a choice or i'd really um i'd i'd really like to uh commit to this relationship but i also like to be single you know all these things that people end up mired in a decision about for years [Music] it's a lot less of a horrible situation to be in if you think about everything being borrowed time in the sense because you stop thinking about you get rid of this idea where you're implicitly like it would be best to try to fit everything in but you can't and that's really annoying and a huge insult so you have to make some choices and it's isn't that terrible instead you can sort of think of it as a menu right it's like nobody expects to it's kind of amazing to have a choice to make and all you have to do is select one right for now are you going to pursue this path or this path i don't know if i'm making this clear but it's like there's no longer this sense that um by rights you ought to have had like 50 000 years to live and the fact that you're only going to get a small fraction of that is an insult to you it's like no you could quite easily have had none and so you know doing almost anything with a little portion of time like that is becomes a lot more i mean it's a privilege but not in a way that you should feel guilty about the privilege in the sense that like it's just so such a luxury to get to enjoy so true so true um since i since i read the book you know anytime i find myself waiting in a queue in the supermarket or waiting in traffic like that's my go-to thought i'm like you know i know a couple of people that have died young and i'm like what would they give just to be here you know and just to get to experience this day like it's such a it's such a great perspective and completely shift your mood as well and you know i'm i'm diabetic as well and if i was born i don't know a hundred years ago i would have just died i would have died at six so i'm i'm living in borrower time you know in my view so every day is essentially a bonus you know and i i i just think that's such a great great view of life um there's so much i don't want to go but 10 minutes after so much when i ask you over um i think one of the most important ideas i've found in the book as well was this idea of uh network time and how our time is more meaningful when it's spent together so maybe if you could tell us about that some of the research from sweden and also the experiment that the soviet union tried out um back i think it was in the 30s and 40s yeah let me see how much of this i can uh i can get through i mean the basic idea here is just that one of the mistakes we make i think when we try to get in control of time and get on top of everything and get and get in the driver's seat is we do it in an individualistic way we assume that the ideal well lots of us anyway assume that the ideal position to be in with respect to time would be that you alone got to make all the decisions about how you spent your time not that you wouldn't want to spend it with friends but that you would be the one making the decisions and what i sort of explore in the book is the idea that there's really a lot of reason to believe that that's not the case that if you had that level of individual control that you would be miserable that ceding a certain amount of control of our time to the sort of rhythms of community and other things is really essential because actually time is not very valuable from very much tall if it isn't properly coordinated with with other people's time so there's this fascinating research from i think sweden um that uh shows that people in sweden are happier they did this by measuring the number of antidepressant prescriptions that were that were collected on the uh the health service there but they um people in sweden are happier to the degree that more other swedish people are on holiday at the same time so there's a way of describing this mathematically that i'm not capable of but basically the the level of happiness that swedes got from being on holiday was was proportionate to the number of other swedes who were also on holiday at the same time and it's kind of a fascinating thought though then just starts to make sense when you think about it right because um if everyone's on hard at the same time uh people you want to see while you're on holiday are probably on holiday too you don't have to worry that um like your inbox is filling up with emails while you're away because uh everyone else is off as well you don't have to worry that people are kind of like scheming to steal your job or something because everyone's so it's a it really speaks to these traditions like in to at least until recently in france right where you could sort of be pretty sure of the specific two weeks or three weeks in the middle of august where it would be almost impossible to um contact anyone in an office because there is this collective synchronized taking of holiday and i've spoken to somebody since the book who worked for the big um corporation in the us who's where they where they started to practice one i think it was just one week a year where the company was just shut down for a week so ever otherwise you got to choose your vacation but this one week there was just nothing and how much more relaxing that is just knowing that you're not you don't have to feel like you're slightly sort of playing truant from the job of work it's like no there's no work to be done go home and but that runs in the face of you know lots of things that have a good side to them like you know flexible work policies and work from home and and you know we tend to say like surely a good employer is the one that lets you work whenever you like as much as that's possible and i think there's lots to that but there's also this other side which is that it really helps us benefit from time especially leisure time if if it's coordinated with other people's yeah just very quickly they tried to in the soviet union they tried to make it so that the factory machines would run every single day but people could still get the rest that they needed by um by uh changing the week so that it was i think five days long and with one day off and then they put the whole um working population at least in the big cities into different color-coded cohorts so that they had a different weekend day off uh than the other cohorts and the idea then was that there would be what four-fifths of the population of the working population would be at work every single day but people would still get their time off and they even tried to say this would be wonderful for the proletariat right because there would be so many queues at shops and at theaters and all the rest of it uh it would be it was sort of spread things you wouldn't get weekend crushes at uh at um at leisure attractions things like that but of course what it did was drive everyone insane by by desynchronizing everybody it meant that you you if you had a friend who was in a different one of these color-coded cohorts you would never be off at the same time um they said they were they the intention or the stated intention was to put husbands and wives into the same color-coded cohort but i don't think that always happened so you sort of break apart family makes it impossible to have uh large church services which by the way was a feature not a bug as far as the um soviet leadership was concerned right to sort of undermine the power of that of the church as against the power of the government and it's just a really sort of vivid um illustration of how people's satisfaction does require does rely on being in a rhythm with other people and i sort of make the argument in the book that although it's impossible to imagine that happening again uh today we've almost created a different uh we've created a sort of version of it through completely opposite means right instead of this very very rigorous top-down governmental control of exactly when people are working the more um of a certain kind of freedom that there is it's only a certain kind of freedom but you know in the gig economy in the freelancerification of the economy in in working policies that allow people to set their own hours more lots of lack of freedom in that all those situations too but we all just end up on different schedules and and you know it just becomes impossible to make or harder and harder anyway to make plans to to meet up with people or to or to um let alone sort of go on holiday with people outside your own family and things like that definitely definitely it's it's it's such an important uh idea especially in modern society and i think the take away from that the practical thing that people can actually sort of implement in their lives is one of the things you suggest is that we should maybe think about uh swapping flexibility of our schedules with um community you know trying to get more involved in like uh communal activities like a volunteering or sports teams or i don't think things like that there right and the the very simple way to do that is just you know you don't need to do that in some huge root and branch you don't need to like become amish or something where your whole life is governed by the rhythms of community just literally what it sounds like with your five side football or you know i've not right now but i've you often for years now been member of a choir they meet at a particular time of day so already your surrender on a particular day of the week so already you're surrendering a certain amount of uh total control of your schedule because you know it's wednesdays at 6 p.m and and if you want to do this thing you just have to live with that because there's you know 80 people involved and you can't have them all change schedule each week on to fit your your situation so that's just a very simple example i think of where giving up a certain amount of control over time brings an immediate reward that you couldn't get if if your absolute driving goal was always individual autonomy over time yeah definitely now can you tell me about cosmic insignificance therapy and i love the the way you describe or the way you introduce the chapter you talk around um if you viewed a human life on average around 100 years and then just taking that back to the pharaohs and you know that kind of gives us a perspective of um how short a human or our time in this planet actually is am i are you with me yeah it comes from this comes from brian mcgee the late uh english philosopher and he um he just basically said look somewhere in the world today there's somebody turning 100. and if you go back to the day they were born there was somebody then turning 100. and if you go back to the time they were born there was somebody turning 100 right so even right back to the beginning of human civilization there's been a few people who lived to 100 even though it's been a lot more than these days so if you sort of imagine these live these lives end to end like i just put it um you know five lives takes you back to henry viii and um 20 lives takes you back to jesus and 35 lives takes you back to um the golden age of the pharaohs so that you know in principle like a letter could have been passed from i mean it doesn't quite work because newborn babies can't pass letters but you know what i mean a letter could have been passed by people who could have been in the same room as each other and there would be six of them to get to the renaissance i mean it's just incredibly short how long human civilization has been and then our own lives are obviously a tiny fraction of that already very short amount cosmic insignificant therapy is just my slightly facetious way of pointing to the fact that there's something liberating about this there's something liberating about thinking that actually you're pretty insignificant in the scheme of the cosmos and universe that the big decisions that you might feel mired in in decision about kind of not going to matter in a few hundred years so actually therefore do take that risk or that courageous action or that bold uh path because the stakes aren't quite as high as we tend to assume and equally uh you know when it comes to measuring whether you thinking about whether you your life is meaningful don't set this standard that requires you to be remembered and set a legacy for thousands of years because like almost nobody can do that that's like shakespeare and michelangelo and about 10 other people you know so just like forget that and then you get to see that why can't it be meaningful to do things that are not necessarily hugely extraordinary or hugely um [Music] uh legacy building what all sorts of things that you know make life a little bit better for a small number of people can be can be totally meaningful ways to spend your life so it's all about sort of lowering the bar a bit um again not to make you say well why do anything then i might as well just you know uh stay in bed but but say that's precisely why to sort of do some exciting and interesting things and not to worry quite as much about uh making the making a wrong decision 100 whenever whenever i really sort of contemplate that idea and you know you really do think about it and you sort of you realize that no matter no matter what i do no matter what i achieve in my lifetime it's all going to be forgotten regardless of you know steve jobs talked about putting a dent in the universe but you know in a few generations no one is going to know who that is and right yeah and and far from being whenever you really do wrap your head around that like that is not a depressing thought i think that is a very freeing thought because like you say it can free you up to take risks and do the things that you you actually want to do with your life and yeah there's something very liberating about about that idea so maybe i don't i don't know if that's depressing note to end on or not over um i'm just curious there's a question for some reason popped them out earlier if you could get a text message to everybody on the planet simultaneously what would it say am i supposed to answer that in like an incredibly self-interested way to try to juice books um uh i i think that part of the thing that i'm trying to remind people of in this book and i'm trying to remind myself of really is this idea that you know life isn't a dress rehearsal that's the cliched way of pushing it and i like this line from i think it's john tarrant a zen teacher who basically just puts this as the question like what if this is it and i think that's a nice little simple way to i think we might all um could do with being jolted a bit more into that perspective so it would be either that or it would be um a web link to buy copies of my book but that would be that would be the more cynical the more cynical approach the publisher would want me to do that i think probably i love that so so the book is four thousand weeks honestly it's it's an incredible book um it really like if you if you do get into it i think it has a potential to completely transform your relationship with time and just enjoy each day a lot more you know and you've also so you get the book on your on amazon and all the usual places and you've also got a newsletter the imperfectionist um which is very good too um is there anywhere else you you would like to send people online or anything over or any no i mean my website oliverman.com has all this information both about the book and the newsletter so that's that's the only other place really brilliant well thank you very much for for taking the time today it's been a real pleasure and i wish you the best luck with the book and everything going forward thank you very much it's been a pleasure thank",

                "content": "[Music] i recently read 4 000 weeks time management for mortals by oliver berkman the average life is 4000 weeks long this is what my four thousand week life calendar currently looks like yours might look like this or this as the remaining weeks on our four thousand week calendar pass by there's pressure to make the most of them each of our remaining weeks are like glass jars passing on a conveyor if we fill each jar as it passes by we feel like we're justifying our existence although brickman says but if we let too many pass by unfilled we feel we've wasted them we don't want to see partially filled jars go by so we take on more responsibility than we can handle and we think of a thousand cool things we want to do before we die imagine all the tasks you have to complete uphold your responsibilities at work and at home are like tiny pebbles piled up in the corner of your mental factory and your bucket list items are like big rocks piled up in another corner of your mental factory as you fill your time jars with pebbles and rocks you live with a constant anxiety that you won't have enough time to do everything you need to do or want to do oliver berkman calls this existential overwhelm if you try to eliminate existential overwhelm with better time management systems and efficiency hacks you'll run into the efficiency trap because the faster you clear the deck of things you need to do like emails you need to answer tasks you need to complete and things you need to clean and organize the faster your deck is filled with new things to do if efficiency is your goal you'll never achieve peace of mind and you'll always feel like you're playing catch-up the anxiety from existential overwhelm the frustration generated by the efficiency trap and the pressure to fill your remaining weeks with activity makes your limited time on this planet unnecessarily stressful however there's a way to eliminate existential overwhelm avoid the efficiency trap and enjoy your remaining weeks while living a productive life first eliminate existential overwhelm several years ago warren buffett was boarding his personal plane when his pilot asked him for goal-setting advice buffett told his pilot to make a list of 25 life goals and arrange them from the most important to the least after the pilot thoughtfully organized his goals buffett said now throw out goals 6 through 25 and never do them under any circumstance life is too short to let the moderately appealing goals in slots 6 through 25 distract you from completing the life-changing goals in slots one through five our modern world provides us with an inexhaustible supply of things that seem worth doing which leads to a bottomless bucket list the irony is that the more we want to do the less we accomplish because the more activities we have to choose from the more we overthink perpetually plan and live in a continuous state of existential overwhelm if you want to eliminate existential overwhelm create and maintain an open and closed life list start by capturing everything you wish to do someday on the open list this might be businesses you want to start skills you want to learn and countries you want to visit now move three to five goals over to the closed list and don't look at the open list again until you complete or forever abandon one of the goals on your close list it's good to have at least three goals on your closed list because there will be times you must wait for a decision or event before proceeding on one or more of your goals once you move three to five items from your open list to your closed list fully accept that you may never complete the items on your open list after emotionally accepting that fact your only concern in life is getting the three to five items off your closed list before you die when you have an open and closed list system it's like you're getting a truck to come and take away most of the big rocks in your mental factory and being left with a few rocks you know you can manage after chipping away at a remaining rock and putting the entirety of the rock in your time jars you can then call the truck driver back and select a new rock instead of just having a bunch of rocks hanging around pulling at your psyche the added bonus of having an open and closed list is that you're less likely to procrastinate because you know the only way that you make room for new and exciting activities is to get an item off your clothes list and create a vacancy for a new goal once you've started eliminating existential overwhelm it's time to avoid the efficiency trap the more efficiently you answer email the more email you receive the more efficiently you conduct meetings the more meetings you'll be asked to lead and the more efficient you clean dishes the more often you'll be put on dish duty so be careful what you choose to be efficient at the more efficient you are at something the more of that something you tend to do as a highly driven individual you may want to be great at everything you do but being great at low value activities usually means a good portion of your 4 000 weeks will feel meaningless rather than doing everything excellent practice strategic underachievement identify all the low return activities you must do to uphold your responsibilities at home and at work then look at each of those activities and ask yourself what is the absolute bare minimum i can do so i can make time for what matters most can you clean your house once a week and stop clinging when you feel it's 80 cling and still feel satisfied can you cut the lawn half as frequently and still feel like you're managing your yard can you take twice as long to respond to email without angering anyone you'll probably find that doing just enough and being good enough at most tasks will allow you to stay on top of your responsibilities and create time for what matters most your time is limited so reduce your standards for most activities make some trade-offs and embrace strategic underachievement in most areas so you can spend most of your time being excellent in a select few areas john acuff author of finish says when you decide in advance what things you're going to bomb you remove the sting of shame now that we've dealt with existential overwhelm and have a way to avoid efficiency traps it's time to enrich your remaining weeks the busier you get trying to fill your remaining weeks with activity the faster life will pass you by but you can subjectively slow down time eliminate busyness and savor your remaining weeks by embracing your finiteness and conducting last time reflections you and i don't know when our life is going to end so it's best that we assume that every experience is happening for the last time this might sound gloomy on the surface but when you experience each activity as if it's the last time you're going to experience it you stop rushing from activity to activity and so can your experience when you treat a kiss with your partner like it's the last kiss you'll have with a cup of coffee you're enjoying is the last cup of coffee you'll ever have or the song you're listening to is the last time you get to enjoy music you'll get lost in the moment and have a richer experience and stop worrying about the passage of time many of us assume that because we've done something a thousand times we will do it a thousand times more so everything feels routine and we stop paying attention to what we're doing but if you stop taking things for granted and start assuming that everything you're doing you're doing for the last time even the most mundane experiences can be filled with beauty and enjoyment in the end most time management systems create existential overwhelm efficiency traps and a never-ending sense of busyness which leads to unnecessary stress and erodes what time we have left on this planet but we can live happy and productive lives by embracing our finiteness and working with an open and closed list embracing strategic underachievement to make time for what matters and practicing last time reflections that was the core message that i gathered from four thousand weeks by oliver berkman this is a hard hitting time management book that will make you rethink your relationship with time i highly recommend it if you would like a one-page pdf summary of insights that i gathered from this book just click the link below and i'll be happy to email it to you if you already subscribe to the free productivity game email newsletter this pdf is sitting in your inbox if you like this video please share it and as always thanks for watching and have yourself a productive week",

                "content": "[Music] hello and welcome to talks with google my name is robin worthy and i'm delighted you could join us either today or live on the youtube catch up we are joined today by oliver berkman author of 4 000 weeks time and how to use it uh oliver is the author of the antidote happiness for people who can't stand positive thinking and for many years wrote a popular weekly column on psychology for the guardian this column will change your life here's a devoted following for his writing on productivity mortality the power of limits and be building a meaningful life in an age of bewilderment uh please join me in thanking oliver for joining us today oliver hi thanks very much for inviting me this is great thank you so much for coming uh well look i am genuinely excited about talking to you uh three four four thousand weeks uh i i i've so many questions so many thoughts about it perhaps you could start by telling us what does four thousand weeks represent why why the why the title of the book so four thousand weeks is extremely approximately the average human lifespan in the west expressed in terms of weeks if you live to be 80 you'll have had a few more than that as i'm sure people can figure out it's pretty straightforward mental arithmetic but it's um i i completely rounded it to a uh to a sort of punchy round number it's it's it's basically how much we can reasonably expect to get to to get to play with in terms it feels like a very small number when represented in which indeed even those who live to be a hundred it's the order of six thousand weeks it's not it's not it's not a lot right no there's something very interesting about weeks because if you express it in days well it's it's a very large number if you press it in years it's very small but we get the scent we have the feeling that a year lasts goes on forever so it doesn't really matter it's that it's that middle zone where you're expressing it in a relatively small number of a quantity that nonetheless we feel is very brief and irrelevant in the course of our lives it doesn't seem like if you waste a week of your life it ought to matter yeah that's very cool um so the book broadly uh speaks about um how do we choose what we choose so that's we can kind of touch upon some of those those subjects um you open by talking about um acknowledging and embracing the the limit embracing life and how time has perhaps had a different meaning to people over the ages perhaps you could talk about that um and how we think about time now yeah sure i mean i think par part of what i find myself doing in talking about this book is is sort of deflecting a potential interpretation of that title i mean i'm glad i've we gave this book an attention grabbing title but there's a misinterpretation i think which would be like okay this is time is incredibly short therefore the only way to make the most use of of it is to live in a kind of white knuckle um very self-conscious and and strenuous attempt to sort of eke the most out of every day and you know do extreme sports every weekend and uh and uh you know never never lose a second and i think that actually what i'm trying to get at here is that there's a huge amount of relief as well as energy and motivation and focus that comes from acknowledging how limited we are with respect to time and thus seeing all the different ways in which we can talk about this i'm sure you know especially in kind of productivity culture and time management but not only all the ways in which we we we proceed as if we might find a way to fit everything in we might find a way to become so efficient as to not have to encounter the the ramifications of being finite so it's really about a sort of dropping back down to the ground and uh making time for a handful of things that really matter and giving up this impossible struggle to sort of uh be infinite with respect to time as opposed to this kind of very exhausting and rather stressful kind of carpe diem approach which you do see in popular culture which i think ultimately is actually just another form of the of the attitude that i'm uh criticizing uh in the book to go even further into sort of unseating our conventional views of time yes you're right i think there's lots of good evidence that the example i hear in the book is english medieval peasants although i think it would also apply to many different cultures at different times in history perhaps also to some indigenous cultures today that this whole notion of time as something separate from you time is as a resource that you have to use well or that you could be guilty of wasting or that you need to sort of save through efficiency techniques the whole conceptual basis of that distinction uh i think we can confidently say just wouldn't have occurred to a kind of working class laborer in early medieval england right um time for for them and for many other people it would have followed the patterns that anthropologists call task orientation right so instead of thinking about your activities as lined up against a schedule or a timeline or a calendar or something it's the tasks themselves that would have given the rhythm to the day time would have just been the medium in which your life unfolded rather than something that you could sort of psychologically objectify and then be tormented by or try to dominate or feel hounded by and you know the productivity guru who had gone up to a medieval farmer and said like why don't you uh do all the milking for the month uh all in one day to get it out of the way because batching your tasks is a really great way to to get more things done i mean obviously that would have been lunacy and still today it's essentially you know lunacy as an approach to milking cows because those things just need doing when they need doing and crops need harvesting when they need harvesting and you know i think we all or many of us have some experience of this kind of time i think that one very obvious example is in the first few months with a newborn baby but i think that you don't have to be a parent to have been in places where that kind of sense of the schedule the sense of the timetable falls away and you're just sort of in time uh it has its disadvantages because you you can't build a sort of industrial technologically advanced society without without um that objectified idea of time but it has some big advantages as well which are a kind of peace of mind that i think is a lot harder for us to access uh today it was um you spoke about when you um time used to be measured in how long it takes to do a task so having to take instead of just using a minute or an hour you'd say all the time it takes to bring in the hair or milk the cat bring the hair milk out it actually made me think of i have a i have a five-year-old daughter and we measure time in the length of her favorite tv shows like how long would it take to get to this bus stop well at the time it takes to watch two of these shows so actually for children who don't understand minutes and hours we still use task based times i thought was quite interesting yeah no it's fascinating and even that kind of comparison like i don't think that would have been the normal way of talking my understanding of the literature is it wouldn't have been a normal way of talking about time it's just that when you had to do some comparing like there wasn't the widespread notion there wasn't the white there wasn't a sort of um widespread adoption of clocks or of time measuring devices among ordinary people so yeah you just have to grasp for some other for some other task as a as a comparator and you know people tend to think that life moved more slowly back then as another example of this but i think that probably that concept of life moving slowly would have been the thing that didn't make sense if you sort of time travel back to medieval england it's not that life moved more slowly but just like what slowly as compared to watch i mean it's just life it's just unfolding it's only a sort of post-industrialization that it is ubiquitous uh to think about life unfolding according to something that isn't life uh a time a timeline or a yardstick um you get it in ancient greece and rome like you get all sorts of things but it's that's a that's a new thing for for almost everybody in the world to be um thinking as a way of governing their lives and perhaps post internet we not only compare ourselves to how much we can family today but how much others are able or seem to be able to cram into a day and so the question of oh how do i do all of the things it's not just all of those those those big rocks that i want to accomplish but that others seem to be doing which i think uh perhaps you could talk about your dislike of the big rocks parable which for those i imagine that many those dudes but for those who don't know it's the it's it's how do you fit the big rocks the small box and the sand into a jar the idea being you have to put the big rocks in first and then the smaller things can fit around those but you dislike that for a very good reason well this is a metaphor for prioritization and it says you know if you want to have time to do everything that counts just make sure you make time first for the things that that really matter um yeah i mean i i think there is some wisdom in here but but the my basic objection is that this is a this is a rigged experiment the uh the person in the in the parable who is bringing these rocks and pebbles and sand into the classroom or seminar room or whether it's supposed to happen has only brought enough rocks uh that he knows in advance will will fit into the jar um and i don't think that our primary problem on the level of individual time management today is that we prioritize things badly although we do i think it is that there are too many big rocks there are too many things that genuinely matter and you know if we had 40 hours in a day we could still fill that time with things that genuinely matter it it isn't that if you find the right tricks and techniques you'll be able to get rid of only all the unimportant tedious stuff and then spend your life in this kind of unfolding of just pure meaningfulness and feel like you're doing everything it's like no you're gonna have to not do lots of things that do matter uh in order to make time for the things that you that you care about the most out of those out of those things let's talk about the efficiency traps so you talk about uh the the curse perhaps of clearing the decks we all come in and i've seen people block out the first hour of their calendars to clear emails you talk about how that actually creates more work right i mean this is something that i'm sure a number of people watching will be familiar with in in other contexts right this general idea which crops up as all sorts of other paradoxes the jevons paradox in in energy efficiency and a bunch of others but if you make a system more efficient without regard to any other governing value you just pursue greater efficiency in processing things through the system then all else being equal the system will fill with more and more stuff rather than bringing peace of mind and will or um or like empty time or capacity and it will um fill with with more and more junk rather than uh good stuff so applied to time management the idea here is you know if you get incredibly good at processing your email all else being equal what will happen is you'll just get more email uh because you'll reply to people and they'll reply to you and those replies will generate replies and they'll go forever you get a reputation for being responsive to email so more people will reach out to email you and just in general email unless it's stopped by some other act on your part email will just come to dominate your life more and more in direct contradiction to your motive initial motivation to uh to sort of bring email under control this is you know this is parkinson's law work expands to fill the time available for its completion um it's that thing where they widen motorways to relieve traffic congestion and it makes the uh it provides an added incentive for more drivers to use that route and so the the congestion sort of tends gradually back towards where it originally was so when i'm talking about the efficiency trap i'm talking about a thing which i think is encouraged by a lot of sort of less good productivity advice and productivity culture which is this idea that there is some inherent benefit in just getting more efficient at doing more things in a smaller amount of time firstly there's no benefit in doing things per se unless they're the good the right things to do and then secondly yeah you get into this problem where where um the more stuff that comes across your radar the the more likely you are to accept additional things to do that actually aren't worth your time because none of these incoming things will have to meet this um filter or me sort of get over this hurdle of is this worth sacrificing something else for because you've convinced yourself that you're gonna have time for for everything when i was working as a journalist on a sort of day-to-day as a feature writer at the guardian um yeah the the better i got at doing stuff the more more efficient i got at doing stuff the the more i began to realize what i was really good at was doing stuff that didn't matter and that the things that i really cared about would just get endlessly postponed while i told myself yeah i was clearing the decks which was your original question and we could talk more about that but anyway i'll stop there for now no that's really cool um and i certainly know when when i clear the decks i actually get a little um like an endorphin rush for having done something like that the element of completeness but um and i don't want to perhaps address the more difficult task um but let's talk about um you talk about finitude and pronounce that correctly uh which which i've sort of summarized is acknowledging our mortality which sounds very a bit bleak but actually when you when you accept that and think about it it can be liberating perhaps you could talk about that concept you've you've coined i mean i didn't invent the word finitude people have people do wonder about how to pronounce it all i can say is in the audiobook for this i say finitude a lot so i really i really hope that's the right uh the right pronunciation i i just mean yes i this is a consequence of the fact that we die but i don't think that this book is really about you know it's not really about death and dying and mortality and that kind of very melodramatic kind of and very difficult uh aspect of human existence it's not about suggesting that anyone can sort of completely confront their mortality i don't think i certainly don't think i have um but rather the fact that our time is limited and that we are sort of material creatures in limited time with limited energy and limited attentional bandwidth and and all the rest of it the consequence of this i'm sort of wrapping up in this word finitude to refer to the state of being limited and therefore having to make by definition you know trade-offs and to exist in a world of opportunity costs and having to make tough decisions not being able to do all the things that we are you know psychologically able to think about and imagine not being able to meet all the demands that society might throw at us there's just no reason to assume that if we can think of something or somebody can ask something of us uh that there's capacity for it in a in a human in a human life uh uh beyond a certain point there won't be and uh these kind of sacrifices will just be be built into the situation so i think what i'm saying for a big chunk of the book is that like this is such an uncomfortable feeling that we pursue all sorts of uh ultimately counterproductive activities to sort of engage in emotional avoidance to feel like we're limitless when we're not i think that a lot of uh distraction is is based on is rooted in that we could talk about that if you like and i think a lot of time management stuff and certainly the years i spent as a sort of weirdo productivity geek um still am a little bit but you know recovering maybe they were it was about trying to achieve a kind of control over my time and my projects and my work in my life that would you know that subliminally would enable you not to have me not to have to confront this i think situation yeah you do you define distraction is motivated by the desire to try to flee something painful about our experience with the present which i quite which i quite liked and um we think about um well perhaps we could talk about the attention economy and how that feeds kind of our desire to be distracted and sort of be feel like we're achieving something whereas actually we're not achieving anything sure i mean i i don't know the individual details of people watching this but i don't feel that any of you are likely to need a sort of basic introduction to the idea of of the attention economy what i'm what i'm trying to explore in the book is well two points really firstly how the firstly that attention is so fundamental to the experience of life that calling it a resource like a limited resource people talk about it is almost uh a misnomer you know it's it there's a sense in which attention just is life and and what you pay attention to over the course of your life will sum up to what your life will have been so it's an incredibly uh serious thing to be involved with either as a user of technology or as or as someone working in uh digital technology but also secondly this thing that i don't think gets us enough attention which is you know i have many many criticisms of social media platforms and algorithmically driven you know attention mining effectively but but we talk a lot as if this is a sort of force that we i mean if you if you read a lot of stuff or you watch you know the social dilemma et cetera you you might be left with the impression that the the typical moment of digital distraction is one in which you know i'm sort of working away on a piece of writing and i'm feeling thrilled by it and it's so wonderful and i'm really enjoying myself and then um like somehow the the evil tendrils of silicon valley come and sort of grab me unwillingly away from my from my work and i do think that some of the tendrils of silicon valley are evil and that we should talk critically about them but that's not what happens what happens is i'm finding the work unpleasant or intimidating or boring or difficult and i am thrilled by the opportunity to go and scroll through down my phone for a bit instead and do something to leave or to leave aside something that i thought was what really mattered to me and go and do something that by definition if it's distraction like doesn't matter to me yeah and so i'm looking in the book at the idea that basically what's going on here is that that um you know it's not a coincidence that things that matter to us induce discomfort um they bring us up against the limits of our capacities and our ability to control how time unfolds you're writing a chapter of your novel you don't know that it's going to go well you don't know you've got what it takes you don't know that people will receive it well it might be forgotten or ignored or mocked you want to have an important difficult conversation with your spouse you don't know how it's going to unfold it might leave you feeling emotionally emotionally vulnerable it might lead to an angry exchange you know you can't you don't have that control it's precisely because these things matter that they evoke these uncomfortable feelings and then i think it feels absolutely wonderful to do something uh less important instead and to sort of zone out and i think the phenomenology of the internet is a super interesting part of this because actually these days we've always been distractible for these reasons but these days not only samuel johnson wrote about it but not only do we have reason to flee the stuff we care about because of discomfort but we have a place to go when we're fleeing it that phenomenologically speaking does feel kind of limitless it does feel like um a a realm where limits don't apply where you can portray yourself how you like find out about things that are happening thousands and thousands of miles away in virtually no time at all um it's very seductive as a as a as a way not to confront the the sort of limitations of being a human creature in time but i do think that ultimately it's only by confronting some of those limitations that we that we make progress on the things that we that we care about so it's uh getting finding some way to tolerate or accommodate or get friendly with that discomfort i think is a pretty much a superpower when it comes to thriving in the modern world no no i certainly struggle that i know every time i delete myself on purpose forget my password for social media i get distracted by the news or putting on the radio or something something else um well the second half of your book uh really speaks about the concept of time and how we how we define it and how we think about it i thought i might just read a small section which really spoke to me at the beginning of chapter eight sure um there's another sense in which treating time is something that we own and get to control seems to make life worse inevitably we become obsessed with using it well whereupon we discover an unfortunate truth the more you focus on using time well the more each day begins to feel like something you have to get through on route to some karma better more fulfilling point in the future which never actually arrives this this future chasing or i think you call it like the when i finally view of ourselves i mean is it is that just part of the human condition is that something we can we can acknowledge i know i know i'm always sort of doing something to get to the next stage um how do you how how have you thought about that and how we can for one of a better phrase live more in the moment yeah such a big question we can come to that because i i have thoughts about that but um yeah i think that um i i don't i think that an instrumental approach to experience right to using to to doing things now for some future gain is absolutely sort of you know as old as humanity nothing would ever get done if people couldn't sort of persevere to to do things and building civilization would never have would never have happened i think then once we all enter into this very instrumentalized notion of time that we were talking about at the beginning where we're all trying to use not only up the resources around us but we're thinking of time as a resource to use well then again it becomes something we have to do i wouldn't have written this book if i wasn't willing to instrumentalize time in a certain in a certain sense and nobody would ever get anything done in their in their professional lives if they didn't so i'm really talking about a kind of over investment in that stance a sense that i think is driven especially by the economic system that we live in and the stage that that's at now excuse me where it becomes the only form of value it all too easily that sort of instrumental mindset just sort of forces everything else out so so in other words you come to think about every moment of time only or pretty much only in terms of its value for some future moment of time and that when it's taken to that absolute place that that clearly is self-defeating and an irrational and and unfortunate uh way to be because it's um you know by definition you're going to you're placing the val the whole value of life constantly uh at some point that is not now and it only ever is now so you're never going to kind of cash out the value of life and find value in the moment so i think it's about sort of having the ability to take both of those perspectives it's certainly i don't recommend and i certainly have never retained myself the ability to care only about this precise moment um and not where it's leading but i think that you know over investment in that we see the effects of that all around us in sort of sapping the meaning from people's lives like what is this all for because they're aware on some level that what it's all for when they get to the time when it's supposedly all four it'll all still be for something in the future from then as well and and so on it felt like trying to find the fun in the moment and perhaps we you think about childhood where you know nursery leads to reception reception leads to this year and you know you're then working towards university and university more than job is for retirement and at which point is yeah at what point are you sort of having fun in the in the moment right right um perhaps you could um you talk about you know within within our con how we work with time and what we think about it um rediscovering rest and hobbies for the sake of it and perhaps you know when we think about having more fun do do we do enough things enough activities which we only do for their own sake you just moved to yorkshire where you probably have more opportunities to go for a walk in the in the in the countryside yeah i'm really i'm having a walk yeah i'm really putting my claims to the test here because i've got no excuse left anymore not to spend a significant chunk of my time hiking on the north york moors and uh so if i don't then i really am condemned uh as a as a failure of uh embracing the moment so we shall see i've been here two weeks i've been on a couple of hikes um i'll report back later um i think that um you know this instrumental this exclusive focus on the instrumental use of time uh is sort of at its most ironic in the context of leisure because like it's if you're even treating your leisure as a means to an end solely as a means to an end then like what what's left the the certainly the sort of ancient greek speaking broadly conception of leisure was that it was the the goal of everything else so you maybe had to work um and you maybe had to do all sorts of things but but but the reason you were doing them all was so that you could get the time the leisure time that was that was sort of life uh in its highest expression which admittedly for ancient philosophers tends to mean what you should do with that time is like philosophy they were that was a so that's not this doesn't necessarily follow but so i'm sort of making the case in the book for something that the the contemporary philosopher kieran satya has described as atylic activities things that you do not because of what they're leading up to or amounting to that are not defined by some kind of end point hiking is a fun example um just because um you know anyone who has any experience of enjoying a walk in the country knows you you probably drive the car to a car park somewhere and then you either go in a loop back to the car or you walk you know a few miles to a to an extreme point and turn around and come back if you wanted to do either of those things most efficiently the simplest way would just be not to go on the hike in the first place um all you're doing is getting getting back to where you started now there are instrumental benefits you know there are you can it's a it's good for your physical fitness uh you um might be like recording your route on all these social um apps for for you know now that enable you to share your um the views that you're gazing out over but basically you hike to hike and as cetera says you know there's not going to become a you're not going to get to a point in your life where you think um okay i've done all the hiking i'd aim to do that job is complete you are going to stop but you're not going to stop because you've reached the end of a project or exhausted an activity you're just going to stop because eventually you will or your interest might change or you may be too old and frail to continue or any number of things and that kind of i think that's i think that's what the the i think that's what is crystallized in the idea of a hobby and i think it's probably why the idea of a hobby feels a little bit cringe and embarrassing in the modern world right unlike as i say but unlike side hustles which are hobbies that have a very clear instrumental value that you're going to make money out of them and they are they are cool and hip and and it's good to have a side hustle it's kind of embarrassing to have a hobby and i think that that is at least in part because they don't fit and they are sort of culturally subversive in a way uh they don't they don't fit into this idea that everything has got to be for something else and quite possibly that something else is is financial profit but not necessarily it's just it's all for something other than itself and that's not true of uh you know of going on a hike um yeah so yeah that's that's that's very cool um i've written on my notes here um painting staring which uh i've not i've not yet had the time to go and find three hours to do this but perhaps you could talk about i've i've i haven't got the the name of the lady who suggested doing it but perhaps you could talk about that and what you found in in taking three hours out of the data stairs painting yeah totally i mean this is this is the part of the book where i'm writing about patience and impatience and i think that um one way to understand the feeling of impatience that is that is uh you know as ubiquitous today as ever it's another example of the way we rail against our limitation right and in that case it's the limitation of how fast we can force the rest of the world to to go um [Music] and this idea that certain activities just take the time they take and and sort of dictate their own speed and we just have to if we want to get the benefit of them we just have to fit around that instead of trying to constantly uh accelerate them up to the level where we would feel like we were the ones in control of them there's a art historian at harvard called uh jennifer roberts who um asks all her incoming students to do this exercise where they have to select a painting or a sculpture in the cambridge boston area and go and look at it for three hours straight um [Music] i think they're allowed to take bathroom breaks but that's it right it's just you just you you you sit there stand there i think you know folding chairs are useful here and um i looked at three hours and the point is you know she knows that's a crazily long amount of time but she knows that how people react to that her insight is that um it's very easy to think that you've seen a painting just because you've looked at it for a couple of seconds uh and that the tempo of life that her students are exposed to today through technology through the hyper-competitive atmosphere at universities like harvard and all the rest of it is such that like she needs to play a role as a teacher in deliberately making the tempo be much much much much slower to sort of make them go through the discomfort of staying in that one place to the point where you you can then see things you know i mean you really do see things in a painting if you look for that sort of absurdly long amount of time and i went to do this i went to meet her harvard and i sat at in the harvard art museums and did a and looked at a painting by uh dagar uh for three hours taking notes that's loud um and you know i spent the first half hour thinking i'd totally chosen the wrong painting i should have chosen something with more to look at which was just a manifestation of the impatience right and you go through then another hour of sort of all kinds of fidgety awful discomfort but on the other side of that you i genuinely did literally see things in this painting uh that i hadn't seen until then uh i'm not i'm not using c metaphorically to mean like i had thoughts about what it could mean i literally saw shadows and facial expressions and lines that seemed to suggest areas of space that i hadn't previously seen it's extraordinary and um it's just a sort of slightly extreme example of the benefit of letting something that you're engaged with take its time i think a more day-to-day example uh stop me if you want to be on something else but more day-to-day example of this is just like reading especially kind of reading fiction people me particularly right people say these days that they don't they can't find time to read that's a very common complaint and i think it's true to some extent but mainly i don't think people mean that they don't have a half hour in a 24-hour period when they could read a book some people are that busy but i think a lot of us are not it's that when we find that half hour and sit down with say a novel we don't we're too sort of um amped up and to running too fast to to slow down to the speed that reading a novel or reading a lot of non-fiction books too um requires so your sort of the flywheel is turning so fast that it feels really unpleasant to to slow it down so naturally you know people want to read summaries and synopsis or find techniques of speed reading to to bring reading up to the speed of of the the rest of life um and i think those do have some benefits for just sort of sheer information absorption but the real experience of reading a good book is just one that like there's a little amount of acceleration you can you can bring to it but beyond that it's just it just takes the time it takes it's given by the book the speed right it's not given by you you don't get to um dictate how fast it goes i guess just finally on this topic i always think it's so fascinating how as technology has made has caused it to take much much much less time to to do things that previously took a long time uh we actually get more and more impatient rather than less impatient yeah why is it so much more frustrating to wait eight seconds for a really badly slow loading web page than like three days to be sent some information in the mail it's like it shouldn't be that way we should be like feeling so relaxed and expansive about how much time we have and the idea i explore in the book is that part of what's going on here is just that we have now thanks to uh technological developments got to the point where it really does feel like we are almost able to do everything we want instantaneously almost able to cook our food in zero seconds flat because it only takes two minutes in the microwave almost able to find any information that we want uh you know with without any perceptible time delay and so in that situation of feeling like you are very nearly uh god it's way more frustrating to run up against the remaining ways in which you aren't you know the the fact that novels still take time to consume the fact that there are some slow loading web pages the fact that it does take two whole minutes uh to heat some food in the microwave instead of zero um if you work in an office with a microwave it's always been cancelled out at like seven seconds because i'm sure people tell themselves because their food was ready but actually i think it's because they're just like they couldn't wait they couldn't bear it anymore and that's the moment at which they were like ah screw this i'm just gonna take the food out because i cannot bring myself to wait these seconds it's really you know i i this is totally anecdotal but i think that people get um more impatient and angrier in in traffic in road traffic now that so much of our life is lived on smartphones operating at broadband speeds because i feel like it the contrast between uh so much of what we can do and the material obstacles of the cars in front just gets more and more pronounced and enraging i wondered if the pandemic had in any way exasperated that because we now do even more online when we're used to food being delivered as and when we want it that when we interact with the physical world yeah those frustrations i don't know a year of living inside i think has to an extent made us even more unaccepting of the slowness of the real world um could be yeah i don't know that and i think there are also advanced i think there are also things we see afresh and appreciate and value about the concrete material world as a result of the time you know the time in the pandemic but yeah it's certainly plausible definitely yeah uh if you have any questions uh whilst watching please add them in the in the chat window um we'll get to those after i've spoken uh asked you about well let's say that we have um embraced our finitude and we've decided which big rocks we want to put into our jar what are some tips that you would give us to start embracing this lifestyle what can we what can we actively do now to kind of to to be better at this it's a really good question yeah you should end the book you speak about yes it's a really good question i am a little bit conflicted about answering it because i do think that ultimately this is about a shift in perspective it is about seeing things differently i don't mean that i expect people to sort of read my book and have a sort of instant spiritual enlightenment experience i it can be a small perspective shift i think it is a so i think it is mainly about sort of feeling your way into this limit embracing mindset and what you find then sometimes is that it's really obvious what techniques or methods you should use to implement that or take one thing i've found for example is that you know productivity techniques i experimented with years ago but did so then in the spirit of trying to become the perfect controller of my time they're perfectly useful ways to organize the day now but i'm holding them much more loosely as a result of having felt my way somewhat into this this different mindset that said i definitely think there are some approaches to organizing work and life for example that that make more sense and that go with this mindset more than more than others one whole set of them is any kind of technique or approach to work that focuses on sort of serializing on sequent or making big projects sequential on getting closer to that state of doing one thing at a time whether that's literally on the level of the individual task or on the level of major projects sort of making most of them cue and line up behind one that you're focusing on now and moving it through and finishing it so the kanban approach to workflow management that i'm sure many people be familiar with uh there's a there's a great book called personal kanban by um jim benson and tony anne barry about applying this uh kind of that kind of approach which is obviously a team approach to your individual workflow there are lots of other ways i give a very simple one in the book about well let me stop and pause the point is all these things having progress all these things have in common is that they limit your work in progress they say okay here are the 40 things that feel like they matter and here are the three or so that i'm going to give my attention to and i'm not going to move on to the others until at least one of those three is is completed so you sort of bring yourself to live with the anxiety of knowing that all these other things are going uncompleted in order to bring something uh to completion and then just quickly you know i think i think all sort of time boxing and time blocking approaches can be well adapted to this to this mindset if you say i'm going to try to ring fence two or three hours of the morning for um sort of focused work that really matters to me and i'm going to try to limit my email processing time to an hour and a half towards the end of the day in both those cases what you're saying is you're not saying i'm going to finish this project today or i'm going to get to the bottom of my email today you're going time first you're saying i'm going to dedicate this amount of time to it i'm going to stop at the end of that time that's kind of a way of thinking about your schedule that really respects the finitude of your time instead of one that goes tasks first and says i've got to get through this whole list come what may and then you find you know that you're still at your desk at 11 p.m and the list just got twice as long during the course of day anyway i think you've actually if we can bring up julie julie's question i think you've actually kind of answered this uh so based on oliver's thoughts on the negativity of distraction i'm curious to hear his take on multitasking and how we can do it in a more time efficient manner i feel like you're saying don't do multitasking yeah i mean it's a little there's a there's some there are some subtleties here there are there's research that show you know certain forms of multitasking with using different kinds of attentional channels and stuff can be that can work i don't tell people they shouldn't listen to a podcast while they're doing the vacuuming or something you can you can combine tasks meaningfully in that way when it comes to our sort of focused focused attention on on sort of mentally taxing tasks um you basically just can't multitask anyway and if you think that you are doing what you're really doing is rapidly switching between things between keeping half an eye on your email inbox and a piece of writing you're trying to do say and calling it multitasking and i think that generally what happens there i think there are personality differences i don't want to tell people they definitely should never do it but generally what happens there if you have um you know three or four or five potential destinations for your attention at any moment is that as soon as any one of them gets difficult or challenging you just bounce off to one that's a bit easier and i think this probably especially happens more on the level of projects as opposed to tasks in other words to some degree manage your moment-to-moment tasks how you like but if you are really telling yourself that say in my case it could be three articles that i really care about if i'm really telling myself that all of those three are going to be kind of moved forward roughly at the same time or during the same period of time all that happens is that the moment one of them becomes difficult because guess what meaningful and important things feel difficult and uncomfortable you just move to the other one so you add you end up managing to make no progress on them because you're just sort of escaping the difficulty at each point so um you know it's not that you can't ever combine tasks or don't ever need to keep an eye on some on your email while doing something else but that like if you see what's going on there and you become more conscious of it you're much more likely to be able to avoid this situation of like not really doing anything because what you're actually doing in those contexts is pursuing the emotional feeling of being in control taking care of business having fingers in pies uh at the expense of getting things done that that you care about brilliant look let's take peter's question is this the midlife crisis book like this do you need to have changed extreme do you need to have chased extreme productivity first and having achieved common life goals family career financial to begin seeking a new perspective on time it's such a good question there's two interpretations of it right is it is this did this book emerge from my having a midlife crisis probably in some sense and then is it only useful for people who are at that stage and i i tried very consciously in in writing this book to not make it a book that was only uh beneficial to people who'd sort of exhausted all those techniques or perhaps what i mean is to point out certain truths about how those techniques work that might um that might accelerate uh a sort of profitable kind of crisis in someone who is uh you know uh in their 30s or their late 20s rather than in their 40s like me um i think there's some truth to this right i think that that that one of the easiest ways to uh understand the limitations of this kind of uh limit denying approach to life is to pursue it very energetically for a number of years and exhaust it and and realize that a different method is is required and i also think that many of the sort of things that people achieve in the first half of adulthood um which is often things like you know establishing themselves in a career separating off from their family of origin and being part of a of their own family um you know these things are can be done with and perhaps even sometimes catalyzed by a sort of unrealistic belief in the degree of your control over your life i guess i i guess i just end up by saying that i don't think it is ever um unhelpful to to see how reality is when it comes to time when it comes to our limitations i don't think it's something that you can only understand at a certain point in life and i don't think it's something that um that it's beneficial to sort of have kept from it to have kept from you as an earlier stage of life you know i'll be honest i think it would be i would be surprised if there were sort of 16 17 year olds who who thought that this book spoke to them i would be very gratified but i think it probably is something that comes from i also think that the age at which people encounter the sort of impossible demands of the world that we've created is clearly getting lower right the age of which people say the wage in which people complain about burnout i mean this is that burnout is a thing that people encounter in their 20s now judging by all sorts of reports and books and studies um not something that you have to have got into your sort of mid 50s uh before you've before you're sort of exhausted enough to encounter it so i think that hopefully the relevance of this the age at which this book is relevant to people is is falling as the uh as the world gets uh more and more insane with respect to timing the pace of acceleration is accelerating is healthy let's take mario's tour mario's question uh thanks to the talk my question is about attention span uh is there any reliable evidence on shortened attention spans as patients in the modern world uh is it real or is it a myth did you do any research on on this attention span is a really weird concept it's a very good question attention span is a really weird concept that i um have tried to understand and don't write about in the book because it just seems extremely uh it it sort of falls apart on on closer in inspection patience i think there's good reason to believe um that um that we sort of tolerate shorter and shorter amounts of time that it takes to do things or to have information communicated to us there's all sorts of fascinating longitudinal research on like the the length of edits in movies and the length of political speeches and uh sort of things like that that at least seem to be responding to a desire for um shorter and shorter bits of focus um i think that yeah i don't i i don't think that it's the most useful way to think about what's happening to our attention to think about that we are um less and less able to focus for extended periods of time i think it is probably more helpful and certainly more clearly true anyway that we are more and more tempted to abandon those focused periods of time and that there are more and more services and devices only too willing to you know use cutting-edge technology to keep us distracted once we have left those uh those that that focus for for distraction so it's in a way you're talking about attention span there but in a way you're talking about the sense that there are other possibilities and if you find yourself in a hut on a mountainside with no internet access and nothing to do but write your novel you're more likely to write your novel not because you've suddenly developed a long attention span but because um alternatives have been taken away from you the the sort of tormenting choice of other options is gone for a while yeah i find when i really need to get something done i will leave my phone and laptop home and take a notepad and a pen to a coffee shop and that's that i can't do anything else except yeah get through that yeah uh i'd love to know um how are you thinking about teaching this to your you have a son how are you thinking about teaching this how can we how can we what should we be teaching our children about this this concept such an interesting question and i don't feel like he's four turning five so i still really don't feel like i know what i'm doing when it comes to parenting and also he keeps getting older and changing so what anything i do learn becomes out of date um i you know i have been sort of fascinated and slightly dismayed just they obviously everyone says it's about kids right they reflect your your own personality back to you in ways that are often uncomfortable you know that when he started to sort of ask what we were doing next what we're doing next and trying to like get a schedule for the day into his head i was like oh my god i've really totally inculcated productivity geekhood uh into him and i'm hoping that uh you know i i think i see that being out here in uh more spending more time in nature is is something that sort of seeps into his uh bones i tell you what i think is the the most sort of uh daunting lesson that i have learned about inculcating lessons i guess is that uh you really have to do it yourself if you want the kid to do it too in other words you if you want to be if you want your child to grow up to be someone who isn't checking their phone every three seconds you have to not check your phone every three seconds and even more weirdly i think it's true that you have to not be i mean he doesn't have a phone but you know what i mean he's already he you know he's he's very interested by screens that are in the house and that's fine but i don't want him to be completely fixated by them not only do you have to be better at yourself in their presence but you sort of have to genuinely live it in your whole life even when they're in bed it's a really strange kind of uh almost kind of uh paranormal phenomenon or something right that like um you can't just uh put them to bed and then for two hours become a completely scattered uh terrible user of time or or something like that if you really want to model those lessons so that's what i'm sort of grappling with i don't want to make it sound entirely to do with screens that's just sort of everyone's always worrying about that so much but like to be present in the moment like i feel like the very best thing i can do is to be better at that and do you think do you think writing the book as a self-confessed um time management do you think writing the book has helped you become better at you know yeah no definitely i think lots of people sometimes assume the way books get written is you sort of have a great insight and then you set it down in in writing but for me the experience of the writing this book was that i did sort of have to as i discovered what i thought about time through writing it i did have to sort of become more of that become more of that person uh partly it's just accountability right i mean if i'm going to give some talk somewhere and someone spots me like impatiently freaking out about how like long the microwave is taking then i'm kind of it's pretty embarrassing but but more generally and more authentically you know it's just like no i i understand intellectually a huge number of things to be true now about time that i previously didn't and then the long haul is kind of living into those uh intellectual realizations and i've and i've done it somewhat and i've got a long way to go wonderful well oliver thank you so much for joining us today it's been it's been genuinely insightful i can't recommend the book enough available in audio you said you've done the audio book as well so yes that's available uh i have not done one of these talks and and put as many post-it notes inside it um as ever uh so yeah genuinely recommend uh is a great read for everyone a good use of one of your four thousand weeks i think was a quote i've stolen from another review online um thank you so on behalf of everyone watching now and in the future thank you so much for joining us hopefully one day for your next book you can join us in the office i will be delightful um otherwise oliver thank you so much for joining us today thank you it's been a pleasure i really enjoyed it and great questions thank you thank you [Music]

by oliver berkman author of 4 000 weeks time and how to use it uh oliver is the author of the antidote happiness for people who can't stand positive thinking and for many years wrote a popular weekly column on psychology for the guardian this column will change your life here's a devoted following for his writing on productivity mortality the power of limits and be building a meaningful life in an age of bewilderment uh please join me in thanking oliver for joining us today oliver hi thanks very much for inviting me this is great thank you so much for coming uh well look i am genuinely excited about talking to you uh three four four thousand weeks uh i i i've so many questions so many thoughts about it perhaps you could start by telling us what does four thousand weeks represent why why the why the title of the book so four thousand weeks is extremely approximately the average human lifespan in the west expressed in terms of weeks if you live to be 80 you'll have had a few more than that as i'm sure people can figure out it's pretty straightforward mental arithmetic but it's um i i completely rounded it to a uh to a sort of punchy round number it's it's it's basically how much we can reasonably expect to get to to get to play with in terms it feels like a very small number when represented in which indeed even those who live to be a hundred it's the order of six thousand weeks it's not it's not it's not a lot right no there's something very interesting about weeks because if you express it in days well it's it's a very large number if you press it in years it's very small but we get the scent we have the feeling that a year lasts goes on forever so it doesn't really matter it's that it's that middle zone where you're expressing it in a relatively small number of a quantity that nonetheless we feel is very brief and irrelevant in the course of our lives it doesn't seem like if you waste a week of your life it ought to matter yeah that's very cool um so the book broadly uh speaks about um how do we choose what we choose so that's we can kind of touch upon some of those those subjects um you open by talking about um acknowledging and embracing the the limit embracing life and how time has perhaps had a different meaning to people over the ages perhaps you could talk about that um and how we think about time now yeah sure i mean i think par part of what i find myself doing in talking about this book is is sort of deflecting a potential interpretation of that title i mean i'm glad i've we gave this book an attention grabbing title but there's a misinterpretation i think which would be like okay this is time is incredibly short therefore the only way to make the most use of of it is to live in a kind of white knuckle um very self-conscious and and strenuous attempt to sort of eke the most out of every day and you know do extreme sports every weekend and uh and uh you know never never lose a second and i think that actually what i'm trying to get at here is that there's a huge amount of relief as well as energy and motivation and focus that comes from acknowledging how limited we are with respect to time and thus seeing all the different ways in which we can talk about this i'm sure you know especially in kind of productivity culture and time management but not only all the ways in which we we we proceed as if we might find a way to fit everything in we might find a way to become so efficient as to not have to encounter the the ramifications of being finite so it's really about a sort of dropping back down to the ground and uh making time for a handful of things that really matter and giving up this impossible struggle to sort of uh be infinite with respect to time as opposed to this kind of very exhausting and rather stressful kind of carpe diem approach which you do see in popular culture which i think ultimately is actually just another form of the of the attitude that i'm uh criticizing uh in the book to go even further into sort of unseating our conventional views of time yes you're right i think there's lots of good evidence that the example i hear in the book is english medieval peasants although i think it would also apply to many different cultures at different times in history perhaps also to some indigenous cultures today that this whole notion of time as something separate from you time is as a resource that you have to use well or that you could be guilty of wasting or that you need to sort of save through efficiency techniques the whole conceptual basis of that distinction uh i think we can confidently say just wouldn't have occurred to a kind of working class laborer in early medieval england right um time for for them and for many other people it would have followed the patterns that anthropologists call task orientation right so instead of thinking about your activities as lined up against a schedule or a timeline or a calendar or something it's the tasks themselves that would have given the rhythm to the day time would have just been the medium in which your life unfolded rather than something that you could sort of psychologically objectify and then be tormented by or try to dominate or feel hounded by and you know the productivity guru who had gone up to a medieval farmer and said like why don't you uh do all the milking for the month uh all in one day to get it out of the way because batching your tasks is a really great way to to get more things done i mean obviously that would have been lunacy and still today it's essentially you know lunacy as an approach to milking cows because those things just need doing when they need doing and crops need harvesting when they need harvesting and you know i think we all or many of us have some experience of this kind of time i think that one very obvious example is in the first few months with a newborn baby but i think that you don't have to be a parent to have been in places where that kind of sense of the schedule the sense of the timetable falls away and you're just sort of in time uh it has its disadvantages because you you can't build a sort of industrial technologically advanced society without without um that objectified idea of time but it has some big advantages as well which are a kind of peace of mind that i think is a lot harder for us to access uh today it was um you spoke about when you um time used to be measured in how long it takes to do a task so having to take instead of just using a minute or an hour you'd say all the time it takes to bring in the hair or milk the cat bring the hair milk out it actually made me think of i have a i have a five-year-old daughter and we measure time in the length of her favorite tv shows like how long would it take to get to this bus stop well at the time it takes to watch two of these shows so actually for children who don't understand minutes and hours we still use task based times i thought was quite interesting yeah no it's fascinating and even that kind of comparison like i don't think that would have been the normal way of talking my understanding of the literature is it wouldn't have been a normal way of talking about time it's just that when you had to do some comparing like there wasn't the widespread notion there wasn't the white there wasn't a sort of um widespread adoption of clocks or of time measuring devices among ordinary people so yeah you just have to grasp for some other for some other task as a as a comparator and you know people tend to think that life moved more slowly back then as another example of this but i think that probably that concept of life moving slowly would have been the thing that didn't make sense if you sort of time travel back to medieval england it's not that life moved more slowly but just like what slowly as compared to watch i mean it's just life it's just unfolding it's only a sort of post-industrialization that it is ubiquitous uh to think about life unfolding according to something that isn't life uh a time a timeline or a yardstick um you get it in ancient greece and rome like you get all sorts of things but it's that's a that's a new thing for for almost everybody in the world to be um thinking as a way of governing their lives and perhaps post internet we not only compare ourselves to how much we can family today but how much others are able or seem to be able to cram into a day and so the question of oh how do i do all of the things it's not just all of those those those big rocks that i want to accomplish but that others seem to be doing which i think uh perhaps you could talk about your dislike of the big rocks parable which for those i imagine that many those dudes but for those who don't know it's the it's it's how do you fit the big rocks the small box and the sand into a jar the idea being you have to put the big rocks in first and then the smaller things can fit around those but you dislike that for a very good reason well this is a metaphor for prioritization and it says you know if you want to have time to do everything that counts just make sure you make time first for the things that that really matter um yeah i mean i i think there is some wisdom in here but but the my basic objection is that this is a this is a rigged experiment the uh the person in the in the parable who is bringing these rocks and pebbles and sand into the classroom or seminar room or whether it's supposed to happen has only brought enough rocks uh that he knows in advance will will fit into the jar um and i don't think that our primary problem on the level of individual time management today is that we prioritize things badly although we do i think it is that there are too many big rocks there are too many things that genuinely matter and you know if we had 40 hours in a day we could still fill that time with things that genuinely matter it it isn't that if you find the right tricks and techniques you'll be able to get rid of only all the unimportant tedious stuff and then spend your life in this kind of unfolding of just pure meaningfulness and feel like you're doing everything it's like no you're gonna have to not do lots of things that do matter uh in order to make time for the things that you that you care about the most out of those out of those things let's talk about the efficiency traps so you talk about uh the the curse perhaps of clearing the decks we all come in and i've seen people block out the first hour of their calendars to clear emails you talk about how that actually creates more work right i mean this is something that i'm sure a number of people watching will be familiar with in in other contexts right this general idea which crops up as all sorts of other paradoxes the jevons paradox in in energy efficiency and a bunch of others but if you make a system more efficient without regard to any other governing value you just pursue greater efficiency in processing things through the system then all else being equal the system will fill with more and more stuff rather than bringing peace of mind and will or um or like empty time or capacity and it will um fill with with more and more junk rather than uh good stuff so applied to time management the idea here is you know if you get incredibly good at processing your email all else being equal what will happen is you'll just get more email uh because you'll reply to people and they'll reply to you and those replies will generate replies and they'll go forever you get a reputation for being responsive to email so more people will reach out to email you and just in general email unless it's stopped by some other act on your part email will just come to dominate your life more and more in direct contradiction to your motive initial motivation to uh to sort of bring email under control this is you know this is parkinson's law work expands to fill the time available for its completion um it's that thing where they widen motorways to relieve traffic congestion and it makes the uh it provides an added incentive for more drivers to use that route and so the the congestion sort of tends gradually back towards where it originally was so when i'm talking about the efficiency trap i'm talking about a thing which i think is encouraged by a lot of sort of less good productivity advice and productivity culture which is this idea that there is some inherent benefit in just getting more efficient at doing more things in a smaller amount of time firstly there's no benefit in doing things per se unless they're the good the right things to do and then secondly yeah you get into this problem where where um the more stuff that comes across your radar the the more likely you are to accept additional things to do that actually aren't worth your time because none of these incoming things will have to meet this um filter or me sort of get over this hurdle of is this worth sacrificing something else for because you've convinced yourself that you're gonna have time for for everything when i was working as a journalist on a sort of day-to-day as a feature writer at the guardian um yeah the the better i got at doing stuff the more more efficient i got at doing stuff the the more i began to realize what i was really good at was doing stuff that didn't matter and that the things that i really cared about would just get endlessly postponed while i told myself yeah i was clearing the decks which was your original question and we could talk more about that but anyway i'll stop there for now no that's really cool um and i certainly know when when i clear the decks i actually get a little um like an endorphin rush for having done something like that the element of completeness but um and i don't want to perhaps address the more difficult task um but let's talk about um you talk about finitude and pronounce that correctly uh which which i've sort of summarized is acknowledging our mortality which sounds very a bit bleak but actually when you when you accept that and think about it it can be liberating perhaps you could talk about that concept you've you've coined i mean i didn't invent the word finitude people have people do wonder about how to pronounce it all i can say is in the audiobook for this i say finitude a lot so i really i really hope that's the right uh the right pronunciation i i just mean yes i this is a consequence of the fact that we die but i don't think that this book is really about you know it's not really about death and dying and mortality and that kind of very melodramatic kind of and very difficult uh aspect of human existence it's not about suggesting that anyone can sort of completely confront their mortality i don't think i certainly don't think i have um but rather the fact that our time is limited and that we are sort of material creatures in limited time with limited energy and limited attentional bandwidth and and all the rest of it the consequence of this i'm sort of wrapping up in this word finitude to refer to the state of being limited and therefore having to make by definition you know trade-offs and to exist in a world of opportunity costs and having to make tough decisions not being able to do all the things that we are you know psychologically able to think about and imagine not being able to meet all the demands that society might throw at us there's just no reason to assume that if we can think of something or somebody can ask something of us uh that there's capacity for it in a in a human in a human life uh uh beyond a certain point there won't be and uh these kind of sacrifices will just be be built into the situation so i think what i'm saying for a big chunk of the book is that like this is such an uncomfortable feeling that we pursue all sorts of uh ultimately counterproductive activities to sort of engage in emotional avoidance to feel like we're limitless when we're not i think that a lot of uh distraction is is based on is rooted in that we could talk about that if you like and i think a lot of time management stuff and certainly the years i spent as a sort of weirdo productivity geek um still am a little bit but you know recovering maybe they were it was about trying to achieve a kind of control over my time and my projects and my work in my life that would you know that subliminally would enable you not to have me not to have to confront this i think situation yeah you do you define distraction is motivated by the desire to try to flee something painful about our experience with the present which i quite which i quite liked and um we think about um well perhaps we could talk about the attention economy and how that feeds kind of our desire to be distracted and sort of be feel like we're achieving something whereas actually we're not achieving anything sure i mean i i don't know the individual details of people watching this but i don't feel that any of you are likely to need a sort of basic introduction to the idea of of the attention economy what i'm what i'm trying to explore in the book is well two points really firstly how the firstly that attention is so fundamental to the experience of life that calling it a resource like a limited resource people talk about it is almost uh a misnomer you know it's it there's a sense in which attention just is life and and what you pay attention to over the course of your life will sum up to what your life will have been so it's an incredibly uh serious thing to be involved with either as a user of technology or as or as someone working in uh digital technology but also secondly this thing that i don't think gets us enough attention which is you know i have many many criticisms of social media platforms and algorithmically driven you know attention mining effectively but but we talk a lot as if this is a sort of force that we i mean if you if you read a lot of stuff or you watch you know the social dilemma et cetera you you might be left with the impression that the the typical moment of digital distraction is one in which you know i'm sort of working away on a piece of writing and i'm feeling thrilled by it and it's so wonderful and i'm really enjoying myself and then um like somehow the the evil tendrils of silicon valley come and sort of grab me unwillingly away from my from my work and i do think that some of the tendrils of silicon valley are evil and that we should talk critically about them but that's not what happens what happens is i'm finding the work unpleasant or intimidating or boring or difficult and i am thrilled by the opportunity to go and scroll through down my phone for a bit instead and do something to leave or to leave aside something that i thought was what really mattered to me and go and do something that by definition if it's distraction like doesn't matter to me yeah and so i'm looking in the book at the idea that basically what's going on here is that that um you know it's not a coincidence that things that matter to us induce discomfort um they bring us up against the limits of our capacities and our ability to control how time unfolds you're writing a chapter of your novel you don't know that it's going to go well you don't know you've got what it takes you don't know that people will receive it well it might be forgotten or ignored or mocked you want to have an important difficult conversation with your spouse you don't know how it's going to unfold it might leave you feeling emotionally emotionally vulnerable it might lead to an angry exchange you know you can't you don't have that control it's precisely because these things matter that they evoke these uncomfortable feelings and then i think it feels absolutely wonderful to do something uh less important instead and to sort of zone out and i think the phenomenology of the internet is a super interesting part of this because actually these days we've always been distractible for these reasons but these days not only samuel johnson wrote about it but not only do we have reason to flee the stuff we care about because of discomfort but we have a place to go when we're fleeing it that phenomenologically speaking does feel kind of limitless it does feel like um a a realm where limits don't apply where you can portray yourself how you like find out about things that are happening thousands and thousands of miles away in virtually no time at all um it's very seductive as a as a as a way not to confront the the sort of limitations of being a human creature in time but i do think that ultimately it's only by confronting some of those limitations that we that we make progress on the things that we that we care about so it's uh getting finding some way to tolerate or accommodate or get friendly with that discomfort i think is a pretty much a superpower when it comes to thriving in the modern world no no i certainly struggle that i know every time i delete myself on purpose forget my password for social media i get distracted by the news or putting on the radio or something something else um well the second half of your book uh really speaks about the concept of time and how we how we define it and how we think about it i thought i might just read a small section which really spoke to me at the beginning of chapter eight sure um there's another sense in which treating time is something that we own and get to control seems to make life worse inevitably we become obsessed with using it well whereupon we discover an unfortunate truth the more you focus on using time well the more each day begins to feel like something you have to get through on route to some karma better more fulfilling point in the future which never actually arrives this this future chasing or i think you call it like the when i finally view of ourselves i mean is it is that just part of the human condition is that something we can we can acknowledge i know i know i'm always sort of doing something to get to the next stage um how do you how how have you thought about that and how we can for one of a better phrase live more in the moment yeah such a big question we can come to that because i i have thoughts about that but um yeah i think that um i i don't i think that an instrumental approach to experience right to using to to doing things now for some future gain is absolutely sort of you know as old as humanity nothing would ever get done if people couldn't sort of persevere to to do things and building civilization would never have would never have happened i think then once we all enter into this very instrumentalized notion of time that we were talking about at the beginning where we're all trying to use not only up the resources around us but we're thinking of time as a resource to use well then again it becomes something we have to do i wouldn't have written this book if i wasn't willing to instrumentalize time in a certain in a certain sense and nobody would ever get anything done in their in their professional lives if they didn't so i'm really talking about a kind of over investment in that stance a sense that i think is driven especially by the economic system that we live in and the stage that that's at now excuse me where it becomes the only form of value it all too easily that sort of instrumental mindset just sort of forces everything else out so so in other words you come to think about every moment of time only or pretty much only in terms of its value for some future moment of time and that when it's taken to that absolute place that that clearly is self-defeating and an irrational and and unfortunate uh way to be because it's um you know by definition you're going to you're placing the val the whole value of life constantly uh at some point that is not now and it only ever is now so you're never going to kind of cash out the value of life and find value in the moment so i think it's about sort of having the ability to take both of those perspectives it's certainly i don't recommend and i certainly have never retained myself the ability to care only about this precise moment um and not where it's leading but i think that you know over investment in that we see the effects of that all around us in sort of sapping the meaning from people's lives like what is this all for because they're aware on some level that what it's all for when they get to the time when it's supposedly all four it'll all still be for something in the future from then as well and and so on it felt like trying to find the fun in the moment and perhaps we you think about childhood where you know nursery leads to reception reception leads to this year and you know you're then working towards university and university more than job is for retirement and at which point is yeah at what point are you sort of having fun in the in the moment right right um perhaps you could um you talk about you know within within our con how we work with time and what we think about it um rediscovering rest and hobbies for the sake of it and perhaps you know when we think about having more fun do do we do enough things enough activities which we only do for their own sake you just moved to yorkshire where you probably have more opportunities to go for a walk in the in the in the countryside yeah i'm really i'm having a walk yeah i'm really putting my claims to the test here because i've got no excuse left anymore not to spend a significant chunk of my time hiking on the north york moors and uh so if i don't then i really am condemned uh as a as a failure of uh embracing the moment so we shall see i've been here two weeks i've been on a couple of hikes um i'll report back later um i think that um you know this instrumental this exclusive focus on the instrumental use of time uh is sort of at its most ironic in the context of leisure because like it's if you're even treating your leisure as a means to an end solely as a means to an end then like what what's left the the certainly the sort of ancient greek speaking broadly conception of leisure was that it was the the goal of everything else so you maybe had to work um and you maybe had to do all sorts of things but but but the reason you were doing them all was so that you could get the time the leisure time that was that was sort of life uh in its highest expression which admittedly for ancient philosophers tends to mean what you should do with that time is like philosophy they were that was a so that's not this doesn't necessarily follow but so i'm sort of making the case in the book for something that the the contemporary philosopher kieran satya has described as atylic activities things that you do not because of what they're leading up to or amounting to that are not defined by some kind of end point hiking is a fun example um just because um you know anyone who has any experience of enjoying a walk in the country knows you you probably drive the car to a car park somewhere and then you either go in a loop back to the car or you walk you know a few miles to a to an extreme point and turn around and come back if you wanted to do either of those things most efficiently the simplest way would just be not to go on the hike in the first place um all you're doing is getting getting back to where you started now there are instrumental benefits you know there are you can it's a it's good for your physical fitness uh you um might be like recording your route on all these social um apps for for you know now that enable you to share your um the views that you're gazing out over but basically you hike to hike and as cetera says you know there's not going to become a you're not going to get to a point in your life where you think um okay i've done all the hiking i'd aim to do that job is complete you are going to stop but you're not going to stop because you've reached the end of a project or exhausted an activity you're just going to stop because eventually you will or your interest might change or you may be too old and frail to continue or any number of things and that kind of i think that's i think that's what the the i think that's what is crystallized in the idea of a hobby and i think it's probably why the idea of a hobby feels a little bit cringe and embarrassing in the modern world right unlike as i say but unlike side hustles which are hobbies that have a very clear instrumental value that you're going to make money out of them and they are they are cool and hip and and it's good to have a side hustle it's kind of embarrassing to have a hobby and i think that that is at least in part because they don't fit and they are sort of culturally subversive in a way uh they don't they don't fit into this idea that everything has got to be for something else and quite possibly that something else is is financial profit but not necessarily it's just it's all for something other than itself and that's not true of uh you know of going on a hike um yeah so yeah that's that's that's very cool um i've written on my notes here um painting staring which uh i've not i've not yet had the time to go and find three hours to do this but perhaps you could talk about i've i've i haven't got the the name of the lady who suggested doing it but perhaps you could talk about that and what you found in in taking three hours out of the data stairs painting yeah totally i mean this is this is the part of the book where i'm writing about patience and impatience and i think that um one way to understand the feeling of impatience that is that is uh you know as ubiquitous today as ever it's another example of the way we rail against our limitation right and in that case it's the limitation of how fast we can force the rest of the world to to go um [Music] and this idea that certain activities just take the time they take and and sort of dictate their own speed and we just have to if we want to get the benefit of them we just have to fit around that instead of trying to constantly uh accelerate them up to the level where we would feel like we were the ones in control of them there's a art historian at harvard called uh jennifer roberts who um asks all her incoming students to do this exercise where they have to select a painting or a sculpture in the cambridge boston area and go and look at it for three hours straight um [Music] i think they're allowed to take bathroom breaks but that's it right it's just you just you you you sit there stand there i think you know folding chairs are useful here and um i looked at three hours and the point is you know she knows that's a crazily long amount of time but she knows that how people react to that her insight is that um it's very easy to think that you've seen a painting just because you've looked at it for a couple of seconds uh and that the tempo of life that her students are exposed to today through technology through the hyper-competitive atmosphere at universities like harvard and all the rest of it is such that like she needs to play a role as a teacher in deliberately making the tempo be much much much much slower to sort of make them go through the discomfort of staying in that one place to the point where you you can then see things you know i mean you really do see things in a painting if you look for that sort of absurdly long amount of time and i went to do this i went to meet her harvard and i sat at in the harvard art museums and did a and looked at a painting by uh dagar uh for three hours taking notes that's loud um and you know i spent the first half hour thinking i'd totally chosen the wrong painting i should have chosen something with more to look at which was just a manifestation of the impatience right and you go through then another hour of sort of all kinds of fidgety awful discomfort but on the other side of that you i genuinely did literally see things in this painting uh that i hadn't seen until then uh i'm not i'm not using c metaphorically to mean like i had thoughts about what it could mean i literally saw shadows and facial expressions and lines that seemed to suggest areas of space that i hadn't previously seen it's extraordinary and um it's just a sort of slightly extreme example of the benefit of letting something that you're engaged with take its time i think a more day-to-day example uh stop me if you want to be on something else but more day-to-day example of this is just like reading especially kind of reading fiction people me particularly right people say these days that they don't they can't find time to read that's a very common complaint and i think it's true to some extent but mainly i don't think people mean that they don't have a half hour in a 24-hour period when they could read a book some people are that busy but i think a lot of us are not it's that when we find that half hour and sit down with say a novel we don't we're too sort of um amped up and to running too fast to to slow down to the speed that reading a novel or reading a lot of non-fiction books too um requires so your sort of the flywheel is turning so fast that it feels really unpleasant to to slow it down so naturally you know people want to read summaries and synopsis or find techniques of speed reading to to bring reading up to the speed of of the the rest of life um and i think those do have some benefits for just sort of sheer information absorption but the real experience of reading a good book is just one that like there's a little amount of acceleration you can you can bring to it but beyond that it's just it just takes the time it takes it's given by the book the speed right it's not given by you you don't get to um dictate how fast it goes i guess just finally on this topic i always think it's so fascinating how as technology has made has caused it to take much much much less time to to do things that previously took a long time uh we actually get more and more impatient rather than less impatient yeah why is it so much more frustrating to wait eight seconds for a really badly slow loading web page than like three days to be sent some information in the mail it's like it shouldn't be that way we should be like feeling so relaxed and expansive about how much time we have and the idea i explore in the book is that part of what's going on here is just that we have now thanks to uh technological developments got to the point where it really does feel like we are almost able to do everything we want instantaneously almost able to cook our food in zero seconds flat because it only takes two minutes in the microwave almost able to find any information that we want uh you know with without any perceptible time delay and so in that situation of feeling like you are very nearly uh god it's way more frustrating to run up against the remaining ways in which you aren't you know the the fact that novels still take time to consume the fact that there are some slow loading web pages the fact that it does take two whole minutes uh to heat some food in the microwave instead of zero um if you work in an office with a microwave it's always been cancelled out at like seven seconds because i'm sure people tell themselves because their food was ready but actually i think it's because they're just like they couldn't wait they couldn't bear it anymore and that's the moment at which they were like ah screw this i'm just gonna take the food out because i cannot bring myself to wait these seconds it's really you know i i this is totally anecdotal but i think that people get um more impatient and angrier in in traffic in road traffic now that so much of our life is lived on smartphones operating at broadband speeds because i feel like it the contrast between uh so much of what we can do and the material obstacles of the cars in front just gets more and more pronounced and enraging i wondered if the pandemic had in any way exasperated that because we now do even more online when we're used to food being delivered as and when we want it that when we interact with the physical world yeah those frustrations i don't know a year of living inside i think has to an extent made us even more unaccepting of the slowness of the real world um could be yeah i don't know that and i think there are also advanced i think there are also things we see afresh and appreciate and value about the concrete material world as a result of the time you know the time in the pandemic but yeah it's certainly plausible definitely yeah uh if you have any questions uh whilst watching please add them in the in the chat window um we'll get to those after i've spoken uh asked you about well let's say that we have um embraced our finitude and we've decided which big rocks we want to put into our jar what are some tips that you would give us to start embracing this lifestyle what can we what can we actively do now to kind of to to be better at this it's a really good question yeah you should end the book you speak about yes it's a really good question i am a little bit conflicted about answering it because i do think that ultimately this is about a shift in perspective it is about seeing things differently i don't mean that i expect people to sort of read my book and have a sort of instant spiritual enlightenment experience i it can be a small perspective shift i think it is a so i think it is mainly about sort of feeling your way into this limit embracing mindset and what you find then sometimes is that it's really obvious what techniques or methods you should use to implement that or take one thing i've found for example is that you know productivity techniques i experimented with years ago but did so then in the spirit of trying to become the perfect controller of my time they're perfectly useful ways to organize the day now but i'm holding them much more loosely as a result of having felt my way somewhat into this this different mindset that said i definitely think there are some approaches to organizing work and life for example that that make more sense and that go with this mindset more than more than others one whole set of them is any kind of technique or approach to work that focuses on sort of serializing on sequent or making big projects sequential on getting closer to that state of doing one thing at a time whether that's literally on the level of the individual task or on the level of major projects sort of making most of them cue and line up behind one that you're focusing on now and moving it through and finishing it so the kanban approach to workflow management that i'm sure many people be familiar with uh there's a there's a great book called personal kanban by um jim benson and tony anne barry about applying this uh kind of that kind of approach which is obviously a team approach to your individual workflow there are lots of other ways i give a very simple one in the book about well let me stop and pause the point is all these things having progress all these things have in common is that they limit your work in progress they say okay here are the 40 things that feel like they matter and here are the three or so that i'm going to give my attention to and i'm not going to move on to the others until at least one of those three is is completed so you sort of bring yourself to live with the anxiety of knowing that all these other things are going uncompleted in order to bring something uh to completion and then just quickly you know i think i think all sort of time boxing and time blocking approaches can be well adapted to this to this mindset if you say i'm going to try to ring fence two or three hours of the morning for um sort of focused work that really matters to me and i'm going to try to limit my email processing time to an hour and a half towards the end of the day in both those cases what you're saying is you're not saying i'm going to finish this project today or i'm going to get to the bottom of my email today you're going time first you're saying i'm going to dedicate this amount of time to it i'm going to stop at the end of that time that's kind of a way of thinking about your schedule that really respects the finitude of your time instead of one that goes tasks first and says i've got to get through this whole list come what may and then you find you know that you're still at your desk at 11 p.m and the list just got twice as long during the course of day anyway i think you've actually if we can bring up julie julie's question i think you've actually kind of answered this uh so based on oliver's thoughts on the negativity of distraction i'm curious to hear his take on multitasking and how we can do it in a more time efficient manner i feel like you're saying don't do multitasking yeah i mean it's a little there's a there's some there are some subtleties here there are there's research that show you know certain forms of multitasking with using different kinds of attentional channels and stuff can be that can work i don't tell people they shouldn't listen to a podcast while they're doing the vacuuming or something you can you can combine tasks meaningfully in that way when it comes to our sort of focused focused attention on on sort of mentally taxing tasks um you basically just can't multitask anyway and if you think that you are doing what you're really doing is rapidly switching between things between keeping half an eye on your email inbox and a piece of writing you're trying to do say and calling it multitasking and i think that generally what happens there i think there are personality differences i don't want to tell people they definitely should never do it but generally what happens there if you have um you know three or four or five potential destinations for your attention at any moment is that as soon as any one of them gets difficult or challenging you just bounce off to one that's a bit easier and i think this probably especially happens more on the level of projects as opposed to tasks in other words to some degree manage your moment-to-moment tasks how you like but if you are really telling yourself that say in my case it could be three articles that i really care about if i'm really telling myself that all of those three are going to be kind of moved forward roughly at the same time or during the same period of time all that happens is that the moment one of them becomes difficult because guess what meaningful and important things feel difficult and uncomfortable you just move to the other one so you add you end up managing to make no progress on them because you're just sort of escaping the difficulty at each point so um you know it's not that you can't ever combine tasks or don't ever need to keep an eye on some on your email while doing something else but that like if you see what's going on there and you become more conscious of it you're much more likely to be able to avoid this situation of like not really doing anything because what you're actually doing in those contexts is pursuing the emotional feeling of being in control taking care of business having fingers in pies uh at the expense of getting things done that that you care about brilliant look let's take peter's question is this the midlife crisis book like this do you need to have changed extreme do you need to have chased extreme productivity first and having achieved common life goals family career financial to begin seeking a new perspective on time it's such a good question there's two interpretations of it right is it is this did this book emerge from my having a midlife crisis probably in some sense and then is it only useful for people who are at that stage and i i tried very consciously in in writing this book to not make it a book that was only uh beneficial to people who'd sort of exhausted all those techniques or perhaps what i mean is to point out certain truths about how those techniques work that might um that might accelerate uh a sort of profitable kind of crisis in someone who is uh you know uh in their 30s or their late 20s rather than in their 40s like me um i think there's some truth to this right i think that that that one of the easiest ways to uh understand the limitations of this kind of uh limit denying approach to life is to pursue it very energetically for a number of years and exhaust it and and realize that a different method is is required and i also think that many of the sort of things that people achieve in the first half of adulthood um which is often things like you know establishing themselves in a career separating off from their family of origin and being part of a of their own family um you know these things are can be done with and perhaps even sometimes catalyzed by a sort of unrealistic belief in the degree of your control over your life i guess i i guess i just end up by saying that i don't think it is ever um unhelpful to to see how reality is when it comes to time when it comes to our limitations i don't think it's something that you can only understand at a certain point in life and i don't think it's something that um that it's beneficial to sort of have kept from it to have kept from you as an earlier stage of life you know i'll be honest i think it would be i would be surprised if there were sort of 16 17 year olds who who thought that this book spoke to them i would be very gratified but i think it probably is something that comes from i also think that the age at which people encounter the sort of impossible demands of the world that we've created is clearly getting lower right the age of which people say the wage in which people complain about burnout i mean this is that burnout is a thing that people encounter in their 20s now judging by all sorts of reports and books and studies um not something that you have to have got into your sort of mid 50s uh before you've before you're sort of exhausted enough to encounter it so i think that hopefully the relevance of this the age at which this book is relevant to people is is falling as the uh as the world gets uh more and more insane with respect to timing the pace of acceleration is accelerating is healthy let's take mario's tour mario's question uh thanks to the talk my question is about attention span uh is there any reliable evidence on shortened attention spans as patients in the modern world uh is it real or is it a myth did you do any research on on this attention span is a really weird concept it's a very good question attention span is a really weird concept that i um have tried to understand and don't write about in the book because it just seems extremely uh it it sort of falls apart on on closer in inspection patience i think there's good reason to believe um that um that we sort of tolerate shorter and shorter amounts of time that it takes to do things or to have information communicated to us there's all sorts of fascinating longitudinal research on like the the length of edits in movies and the length of political speeches and uh sort of things like that that at least seem to be responding to a desire for um shorter and shorter bits of focus um i think that yeah i don't i i don't think that it's the most useful way to think about what's happening to our attention to think about that we are um less and less able to focus for extended periods of time i think it is probably more helpful and certainly more clearly true anyway that we are more and more tempted to abandon those focused periods of time and that there are more and more services and devices only too willing to you know use cutting-edge technology to keep us distracted once we have left those uh those that that focus for for distraction so it's in a way you're talking about attention span there but in a way you're talking about the sense that there are other possibilities and if you find yourself in a hut on a mountainside with no internet access and nothing to do but write your novel you're more likely to write your novel not because you've suddenly developed a long attention span but because um alternatives have been taken away from you the the sort of tormenting choice of other options is gone for a while yeah i find when i really need to get something done i will leave my phone and laptop home and take a notepad and a pen to a coffee shop and that's that i can't do anything else except yeah get through that yeah uh i'd love to know um how are you thinking about teaching this to your you have a son how are you thinking about teaching this how can we how can we what should we be teaching our children about this this concept such an interesting question and i don't feel like he's four turning five so i still really don't feel like i know what i'm doing when it comes to parenting and also he keeps getting older and changing so what anything i do learn becomes out of date um i you know i have been sort of fascinated and slightly dismayed just they obviously everyone says it's about kids right they reflect your your own personality back to you in ways that are often uncomfortable you know that when he started to sort of ask what we were doing next what we're doing next and trying to like get a schedule for the day into his head i was like oh my god i've really totally inculcated productivity geekhood uh into him and i'm hoping that uh you know i i think i see that being out here in uh more spending more time in nature is is something that sort of seeps into his uh bones i tell you what i think is the the most sort of uh daunting lesson that i have learned about inculcating lessons i guess is that uh you really have to do it yourself if you want the kid to do it too in other words you if you want to be if you want your child to grow up to be someone who isn't checking their phone every three seconds you have to not check your phone every three seconds and even more weirdly i think it's true that you have to not be i mean he doesn't have a phone but you know what i mean he's already he you know he's he's very interested by screens that are in the house and that's fine but i don't want him to be completely fixated by them not only do you have to be better at yourself in their presence but you sort of have to genuinely live it in your whole life even when they're in bed it's a really strange kind of uh almost kind of uh paranormal phenomenon or something right that like um you can't just uh put them to bed and then for two hours become a completely scattered uh terrible user of time or or something like that if you really want to model those lessons so that's what i'm sort of grappling with i don't want to make it sound entirely to do with screens that's just sort of everyone's always worrying about that so much but like to be present in the moment like i feel like the very best thing i can do is to be better at that and do you think do you think writing the book as a self-confessed um time management do you think writing the book has helped you become better at you know yeah no definitely i think lots of people sometimes assume the way books get written is you sort of have a great insight and then you set it down in in writing but for me the experience of the writing this book was that i did sort of have to as i discovered what i thought about time through writing it i did have to sort of become more of that become more of that person uh partly it's just accountability right i mean if i'm going to give some talk somewhere and someone spots me like impatiently freaking out about how like long the microwave is taking then i'm kind of it's pretty embarrassing but but more generally and more authentically you know it's just like no i i understand intellectually a huge number of things to be true now about time that i previously didn't and then the long haul is kind of living into those uh intellectual realizations and i've and i've done it somewhat and i've got a long way to go wonderful well oliver thank you so much for joining us today it's been it's been genuinely insightful i can't recommend the book enough available in audio you said you've done the audio book as well so yes that's available uh i have not done one of these talks and and put as many post-it notes inside it um as ever uh so yeah genuinely recommend uh is a great read for everyone a good use of one of your four thousand weeks i think was a quote i've stolen from another review online um thank you so on behalf of everyone watching now and in the future thank you so much for joining us hopefully one day for your next book you can join us in the office i will be delightful um otherwise oliver thank you so much for joining us today thank you it's been a pleasure i really enjoyed it and great questions thank you thank you [Music]

at each of those activities and ask yourself what is the absolute bare minimum i can do so i can make time for what matters most can you clean your house once a week and stop clinging when you feel it's 80 cling and still feel satisfied can you cut the lawn half as frequently and still feel like you're managing your yard can you take twice as long to respond to email without angering anyone you'll probably find that doing just enough and being good enough at most tasks will allow you to stay on top of your responsibilities and create time for what matters most your time is limited so reduce your standards for most activities make some trade-offs and embrace strategic underachievement in most areas so you can spend most of your time being excellent in a select few areas john acuff author of finish says when you decide in advance what things you're going to bomb you remove the sting of shame now that we've dealt with existential overwhelm and have a way to avoid efficiency traps it's time to enrich your remaining weeks the busier you get trying to fill your remaining weeks with activity the faster life will pass you by but you can subjectively slow down time eliminate busyness and savor your remaining weeks by embracing your finiteness and conducting last time reflections you and i don't know when our life is going to end so it's best that we assume that every experience is happening for the last time this might sound gloomy on the surface but when you experience each activity as if it's the last time you're going to experience it you stop rushing from activity to activity and so can your experience when you treat a kiss with your partner like it's the last kiss you'll have with a cup of coffee you're enjoying is the last cup of coffee you'll ever have or the song you're listening to is the last time you get to enjoy music you'll get lost in the moment and have a richer experience and stop worrying about the passage of time many of us assume that because we've done something a thousand times we will do it a thousand times more so everything feels routine and we stop paying attention to what we're doing but if you stop taking things for granted and start assuming that everything you're doing you're doing for the last time even the most mundane experiences can be filled with beauty and enjoyment in the end most time management systems create existential overwhelm efficiency traps and a never-ending sense of busyness which leads to unnecessary stress and erodes what time we have left on this planet but we can live happy and productive lives by embracing our finiteness and working with an open and closed list embracing strategic underachievement to make time for what matters and practicing last time reflections that was the core message that i gathered from four thousand weeks by oliver berkman this is a hard hitting time management book that will make you rethink your relationship with time i highly recommend it if you would like a one-page pdf summary of insights that i gathered from this book just click the link below and i'll be happy to email it to you if you already subscribe to the free productivity game

                "content": "a few years ago i arrived at an art gallery that's part of harvard university in the united states i sat down on a folding chair in front of this painting which is called cotton merchants in new orleans by edgar dager and i looked at it for three hours straight i think this might legitimately prompt a question in some people's minds something along the lines of what in the name of all that is holy would you want to go and do that for i didn't do it because i love art galleries because i kind of don't love art galleries i find it so exhausting that thing you end up doing where you shuffle from painting to painting wondering if you've spent a sufficiently respectable amount of time in front of one of them to move on to the next and looking at one painting for three hours straight is kind of torture it's not um it's not boring it's agony you might remember some research from a few years ago that suggested that about 45 percent of people if you put them in a room on their own with nothing except a machine they can use to administer electric shocks to themselves would rather self-administer electric shocks than just sit there and you probably thought if you saw that you probably thought these people are crazy i'm telling you try to spend three hours looking at cotton merchants in new orleans by edgardaga and you will start craving some of that sweet sweet voltage now the reason i was there was because i was trying to develop a skill i've become convinced is tantamount to a superpower in the in the modern world i think it's the missing piece of the puzzle when it comes to living happier less overwhelmed lives when it comes to finally getting around to the things we care about the most maybe even when it comes to addressing some of our most pressing social and political problems the trouble is it's like the least sexy sounding superpower you can possibly imagine it's nothing to do with passion and inspiration and creativity and all that stuff it's the skill you've been railing against ever since you were four years old and your parents told you you needed to show more of it i'm talking about patience it's a superpower but i don't think there's going to be a successful uh superhero franchise anytime soon based around the adventures of a character called incredibly patient man lucky for you this is a ted talk a format designed for an era when nobody has any patience at all and 10 minutes from now you will know everything that i know about patients a lot of my work has focused on this idea of our daily struggles with time and how we can find some more sanity in that relationship and we talk a lot here a lot don't we about distraction busyness overwhelm burnout i don't think we pay enough attention to the lens of impatience which i define as the feeling that you need to make the world move faster than you actually can make it move so for example there's a little bit of the world that is my five-year-old son there's the speed at which i feel i need him to move when we're putting on his clothes to leave the house there's the speed at which he actually does move and then there's the the friction the discrepancy between the two there's a huge amount of evidence to suggest how impatient we've become as a society but my favorite example is the estimate that amazon would lose 1.6 billion dollars a year if it's home page loaded one second more slowly than it does because that's how impatient we've become so for example i think a lot of what we think of as overwhelm busyness or at least the pain of that is actually impatience it's the feeling that we need to have our tasks go faster than they actually can go if we're to avoid drowning in our responsibilities a lot of the anger that we see all around us today i think is ultimately impatient i used to live in new york city where the moment any driver encounters a traffic jam they just lean on their horns you know and it's not because they think that honking is going to solve the problem of traffic congestion in new york that honk is just an existential howl of rage about the fact that they can't make that bit of reality move as fast as they think they need it to and likewise we talk a lot about distraction i think distractibility is very often in patients too people say they're too distractible to sit down with a good book i think they mean that when we try to let ourselves read a book give ourselves over to the time that reading a book takes it's too painful to slow down to the time that that requires and perhaps you've noticed this bizarre irony that all the technology we've developed to save ourselves time ends up making us feel more impatient this should not be what happens by any sane logic right in a world with 747s and dishwashers and email and smartphones we ought to all feel much much more relaxed because of all the time that has been freed up but of course that's not what happens anyone who's ever worked in any office with a communal kitchen knows that thing where you arrive to use the microwave and you find seven seconds left on the clock by the last person so you have to cancel it and reset to use it yourself it's not because the last person reached that point and made a very judicious decision that their leftover lasagna was at exactly the right level of heatedness no it's because they got seven seconds from when the dinger was due to ding and they just couldn't bear the waiting any longer so in a roundabout way that's what i was doing on this folding chair at the art museum at harvard i'd noticed all this impatience in myself and i wanted to try to reconnect to a sense of patience this exercise the three-hour exercise comes from an art historian at harvard professor jennifer roberts and she has all her incoming students do it right they have to choose a painting or a sculpture and go and look at it for three hours straight she knows that this is torture but her argument is that in a world conditioned for hurry a world that's so committed to the idea that we have to do everything as fast as we possibly can you actually need these kinds of structures you need to be able to force yourself to slow down to let the thing take the time it takes because it's all too easy to think that just by looking at a painting for a few seconds you've thereby seen it really seen it in fact seeing a painting is something where you don't get to dictate the schedule it just takes the time that it takes and professor roberts makes this fascinating point about patients that part of the reason we think about it is so yucky and boring is because we associate it with with passivity with a lack of power we think of for example young women in victorian times urged to cultivate the virtue of patients basically just to reconcile themselves to the fact that their societal role was to stay home and not be ambitious and do needlework and wait while their husbands did more exciting things in the public sphere but as society accelerates patience actually becomes a form of power it becomes the ability to resist the urge to go along with all the internal and external pressures that are prompting us to go faster and faster it becomes the ability to benefit from experiences that you would not have if you just went as fast as everyone else it becomes subversive and i think certain great figures in history have long understood this right look at patience in the the work and the example of martin luther king or mahatma gandhi this is not patience as uh resigning yourself to your fate it's the opposite it's the patience to wait out the oppressor until finally victory can be achieved but it may be the case that this is a kind of power that we all need to try to seize now the problem is it is not a remotely comfortable uh power to try to seize uh 40 minutes into my time on the chair at harvard i was just squirming in my seat i was so annoyed that i hadn't chosen a different painting i was furious that the idiot who was making me do this stupid stunt even though that idiot was myself i looked at my watch at one point i was convinced i must be about halfway through my three hours and 17 minutes i think it's worth stopping to ask why should it feel so painful to give a painting or a book or a five-year-old or a relationship problem or a business dilemma you know the time that it requires i guess the sort of grand unifying thesis of my work on time is that we have a very hard time as human beings with our finitude with the fact that we only get on average about 4 000 weeks on the planet so there's always going to be more to do than we possibly can do and with the fact that we have so little control over that time we don't know how the future is going to unfold we can never feel secure about what's coming and so we're constantly engaging in all these futile and stress-inducing attempts to make ourselves feel more in control of our time than we really are and hurrying through life trying to make reality go faster is one way a really good way to try to acquire that feeling because it feels like doesn't it if you could just go fast enough you could finally reach that sort of serene and commanding position of of mastery of your time now it doesn't work because the supply of things to do is infinite so you're never going to get through it no matter how far you get go how fast you go but it feels like it might and so it's it's comforting whereas patience requires facing the truth that you're limited that you don't get to dictate the speed of reality and it involves the painful confrontation with the fact that you just have to let certain things take the time they take so in a moment i'll close out here by giving you three examples of how i think you can harness the power of patients in your own life and why it's a the pain of patience is a price so worth paying not just in art appreciation but first of all just for the record this is what happens when you spend three hours looking at uh cotton merchants in new orleans by edgar dager on a folding chair at the harvard art museums it's really uncomfortable for a while i mean really uncomfortable but what happens eventually is that you sort of surrender to the discomfort you stop trying to run away from the present into the future and that is when the painting starts to give up its secrets so if you're me you start to literally see things you haven't seen before like the sort of ghostly translucency of the figure on the right or the way that the furniture the lines of the the objects seem to pass through the bodies of the of the characters in the painting all sorts of things like this and then eventually you're sort of sucked into the scene in the painting it's like you're there it's like you can feel the humidity and the claustrophobia and the watchfulness on the faces of the men and and taste the dust in the air and hear the creak of the floorboards it's like when you surrender the attempt to dictate the speed of the experience that's when the real experience can begin so i promised you quickly three tools and the first of these is to practice creative waiting the poet john keats called this negative capability he's talking about the ability to stay in that space of uh not knowing of not having a solution instead of always anxiously racing forward so that you get any solution at all and he thought that this explained the genius of william shakespeare i'm going to use an example from the other end of the spectrum household repairs the idea is that when you face some challenge like i did the other day when the water supply to our dishwasher came loose and there was a leak that i couldn't figure out just see what happens if you just stop and look so the old me would have opened the cupboard under the sink and just like stabbed around in there hoping to almost solve the problem by chance but now i knew what i had to do is what i did do i got on my back and i inserted my head into the cupboard under the sink and i just started tracing the pipes and the connectors and five minutes in the fix was incredibly obvious by being willing to go more slowly towards the solution i actually ended up going more quickly to a solution and if that works for shakespeare and fixing my dishwasher i venture to suggest that it works for pretty much everything for our relationships with our kids our business and creative troubles and and all the rest of it number two is to embrace the power of stopping you hear endlessly in sort of creativity circles about how important it is to just get started and that's true but the american psychologist robert boyce when he was studying the writing practices of academics he discovered something very interesting which is that the ones who produce the most writing who developed the most accomplished body of work they were also really good at stopping if they decided to work for say 90 minutes on writing in a given day they did their 19 minutes they got up and walked away that way they didn't turn writing into this huge intimidating problematic thing in their lives boyce that that urge to keep on going when time is up it's very often just impatience it's the feeling that you've really got to get this finished now or that you're worried you might never feel as inspired again so you've got to harness the time if instead you can bring yourself when you're pursuing a creative calling or developing a habit to get up and walk away after even a very short time that's the way to build this muscle of patience that will keep you coming back and back and back and producing the most over the long term and then finally learn to do one thing at a time you don't need me to tell you that multitasking doesn't work we can't never hear the end of that these days but it's interesting to me i think that the reason it doesn't work is because it is ultimately another kind of impatience there's that feeling isn't there that if you have a finger in every pie you have multiple projects on the go or you're literally doing multiple tasks at the same time that you're getting through stuff as fast as you need to get through it you're going to achieve that state of total control over your time totally doesn't work because actually what happens is the moment any task gets difficult you just bounce off to another task instead so you never go through the difficult and challenging parts of any project so what you have to do instead i'm convinced is tolerate the anxiety of neglecting almost everything on your to-do list keeping it waiting outside the door while you do one thing finish it go and get one more thing it's not pleasant but it is the way ultimately to focus and get more done that you actually care about getting done and that just to finish i mean i think that's the most important point here a lot of this is incredibly painful i'm not even convinced that anything i'm saying here is a recipe for a happier life it actually sort of it actually hurts to slow down to the speed of reality it doesn't feel good i think that it can start to feel good but we should stop expecting that for example when you first sit down to try to focus on a good book that it's going to feel great our minds are conditioned to go much much faster than that or even stopping to rest don't expect the first day of a beach holiday to feel as delightful as you expect because it pushes back against everything that we're conditioned to do instead or listening really listening to other people the sovereign act of patience perhaps in in relationships as opposed to just waiting till they finish talking so you can say the thing that you were planning to say i don't think that ever gets easy i think it it's kind of it kind of sucks so i don't think it's a recipe of happiness i think that it is a recipe for a much more meaningful life because i think if we can enter into this mode of living where we have slowed back down to the speed at which reality actually unfolds if we can surrender a little bit that craving to dictate how fast the whole of the rest of the world goes we will find that we live more fully that we spend more time doing the things we really care about the most and that we get to appreciate a little bit more this absurd and ridiculous gift that we all get of having any time on the planet at all thank you very much [Applause] you",

by oliver berkman author of 4 000 weeks time and how to use it uh oliver is the author of the antidote happiness for people who can't stand positive thinking and for many years wrote a popular weekly column on psychology for the guardian this column will change your life here's a devoted following for his writing on productivity mortality the power of limits and be building a meaningful life in an age of bewilderment uh please join me in thanking oliver for joining us today oliver hi thanks very much for inviting me this is great thank you so much for coming uh well look i am genuinely excited about talking to you uh three four four thousand weeks uh i i i've so many questions so many thoughts about it perhaps you could start by telling us what does four thousand weeks represent why why the why the title of the book so four thousand weeks is extremely approximately the average human lifespan in the west expressed in terms of weeks if you live to be 80 you'll have had a few more than that as i'm sure people can figure out it's pretty straightforward mental arithmetic but it's um i i completely rounded it to a uh to a sort of punchy round number it's it's it's basically how much we can reasonably expect to get to to get to play with in terms it feels like a very small number when represented in which indeed even those who live to be a hundred it's the order of six thousand weeks it's not it's not it's not a lot right no there's something very interesting about weeks because if you express it in days well it's it's a very large number if you press it in years it's very small but we get the scent we have the feeling that a year lasts goes on forever so it doesn't really matter it's that it's that middle zone where you're expressing it in a relatively small number of a quantity that nonetheless we feel is very brief and irrelevant in the course of our lives it doesn't seem like if you waste a week of your life it ought to matter yeah that's very cool um so the book broadly uh speaks about um how do we choose what we choose so that's we can kind of touch upon some of those those subjects um you open by talking about um acknowledging and embracing the the limit embracing life and how time has perhaps had a different meaning to people over the ages perhaps you could talk about that um and how we think about time now yeah sure i mean i think par part of what i find myself doing in talking about this book is is sort of deflecting a potential interpretation of that title i mean i'm glad i've we gave this book an attention grabbing title but there's a misinterpretation i think which would be like okay this is time is incredibly short therefore the only way to make the most use of of it is to live in a kind of white knuckle um very self-conscious and and strenuous attempt to sort of eke the most out of every day and you know do extreme sports every weekend and uh and uh you know never never lose a second and i think that actually what i'm trying to get at here is that there's a huge amount of relief as well as energy and motivation and focus that comes from acknowledging how limited we are with respect to time and thus seeing all the different ways in which we can talk about this i'm sure you know especially in kind of productivity culture and time management but not only all the ways in which we we we proceed as if we might find a way to fit everything in we might find a way to become so efficient as to not have to encounter the the ramifications of being finite so it's really about a sort of dropping back down to the ground and uh making time for a handful of things that really matter and giving up this impossible struggle to sort of uh be infinite with respect to time as opposed to this kind of very exhausting and rather stressful kind of carpe diem approach which you do see in popular culture which i think ultimately is actually just another form of the of the attitude that i'm uh criticizing uh in the book to go even further into sort of unseating our conventional views of time yes you're right i think there's lots of good evidence that the example i hear in the book is english medieval peasants although i think it would also apply to many different cultures at different times in history perhaps also to some indigenous cultures today that this whole notion of time as something separate from you time is as a resource that you have to use well or that you could be guilty of wasting or that you need to sort of save through efficiency techniques the whole conceptual basis of that distinction uh i think we can confidently say just wouldn't have occurred to a kind of working class laborer in early medieval england right um time for for them and for many other people it would have followed the patterns that anthropologists call task orientation right so instead of thinking about your activities as lined up against a schedule or a timeline or a calendar or something it's the tasks themselves that would have given the rhythm to the day time would have just been the medium in which your life unfolded rather than something that you could sort of psychologically objectify and then be tormented by or try to dominate or feel hounded by and you know the productivity guru who had gone up to a medieval farmer and said like why don't you uh do all the milking for the month uh all in one day to get it out of the way because batching your tasks is a really great way to to get more things done i mean obviously that would have been lunacy and still today it's essentially you know lunacy as an approach to milking cows because those things just need doing when they need doing and crops need harvesting when they need harvesting and you know i think we all or many of us have some experience of this kind of time i think that one very obvious example is in the first few months with a newborn baby but i think that you don't have to be a parent to have been in places where that kind of sense of the schedule the sense of the timetable falls away and you're just sort of in time uh it has its disadvantages because you you can't build a sort of industrial technologically advanced society without without um that objectified idea of time but it has some big advantages as well which are a kind of peace of mind that i think is a lot harder for us to access uh today it was um you spoke about when you um time used to be measured in how long it takes to do a task so having to take instead of just using a minute or an hour you'd say all the time it takes to bring in the hair or milk the cat bring the hair milk out it actually made me think of i have a i have a five-year-old daughter and we measure time in the length of her favorite tv shows like how long would it take to get to this bus stop well at the time it takes to watch two of these shows so actually for children who don't understand minutes and hours we still use task based times i thought was quite interesting yeah no it's fascinating and even that kind of comparison like i don't think that would have been the normal way of talking my understanding of the literature is it wouldn't have been a normal way of talking about time it's just that when you had to do some comparing like there wasn't the widespread notion there wasn't the white there wasn't a sort of um widespread adoption of clocks or of time measuring devices among ordinary people so yeah you just have to grasp for some other for some other task as a as a comparator and you know people tend to think that life moved more slowly back then as another example of this but i think that probably that concept of life moving slowly would have been the thing that didn't make sense if you sort of time travel back to medieval england it's not that life moved more slowly but just like what slowly as compared to watch i mean it's just life it's just unfolding it's only a sort of post-industrialization that it is ubiquitous uh to think about life unfolding according to something that isn't life uh a time a timeline or a yardstick um you get it in ancient greece and rome like you get all sorts of things but it's that's a that's a new thing for for almost everybody in the world to be um thinking as a way of governing their lives and perhaps post internet we not only compare ourselves to how much we can family today but how much others are able or seem to be able to cram into a day and so the question of oh how do i do all of the things it's not just all of those those those big rocks that i want to accomplish but that others seem to be doing which i think uh perhaps you could talk about your dislike of the big rocks parable which for those i imagine that many those dudes but for those who don't know it's the it's it's how do you fit the big rocks the small box and the sand into a jar the idea being you have to put the big rocks in first and then the smaller things can fit around those but you dislike that for a very good reason well this is a metaphor for prioritization and it says you know if you want to have time to do everything that counts just make sure you make time first for the things that that really matter um yeah i mean i i think there is some wisdom in here but but the my basic objection is that this is a this is a rigged experiment the uh the person in the in the parable who is bringing these rocks and pebbles and sand into the classroom or seminar room or whether it's supposed to happen has only brought enough rocks uh that he knows in advance will will fit into the jar um and i don't think that our primary problem on the level of individual time management today is that we prioritize things badly although we do i think it is that there are too many big rocks there are too many things that genuinely matter and you know if we had 40 hours in a day we could still fill that time with things that genuinely matter it it isn't that if you find the right tricks and techniques you'll be able to get rid of only all the unimportant tedious stuff and then spend your life in this kind of unfolding of just pure meaningfulness and feel like you're doing everything it's like no you're gonna have to not do lots of things that do matter uh in order to make time for the things that you that you care about the most out of those out of those things let's talk about the efficiency traps so you talk about uh the the curse perhaps of clearing the decks we all come in and i've seen people block out the first hour of their calendars to clear emails you talk about how that actually creates more work right i mean this is something that i'm sure a number of people watching will be familiar with in in other contexts right this general idea which crops up as all sorts of other paradoxes the jevons paradox in in energy efficiency and a bunch of others but if you make a system more efficient without regard to any other governing value you just pursue greater efficiency in processing things through the system then all else being equal the system will fill with more and more stuff rather than bringing peace of mind and will or um or like empty time or capacity and it will um fill with with more and more junk rather than uh good stuff so applied to time management the idea here is you know if you get incredibly good at processing your email all else being equal what will happen is you'll just get more email uh because you'll reply to people and they'll reply to you and those replies will generate replies and they'll go forever you get a reputation for being responsive to email so more people will reach out to email you and just in general email unless it's stopped by some other act on your part email will just come to dominate your life more and more in direct contradiction to your motive initial motivation to uh to sort of bring email under control this is you know this is parkinson's law work expands to fill the time available for its completion um it's that thing where they widen motorways to relieve traffic congestion and it makes the uh it provides an added incentive for more drivers to use that route and so the the congestion sort of tends gradually back towards where it originally was so when i'm talking about the efficiency trap i'm talking about a thing which i think is encouraged by a lot of sort of less good productivity advice and productivity culture which is this idea that there is some inherent benefit in just getting more efficient at doing more things in a smaller amount of time firstly there's no benefit in doing things per se unless they're the good the right things to do and then secondly yeah you get into this problem where where um the more stuff that comes across your radar the the more likely you are to accept additional things to do that actually aren't worth your time because none of these incoming things will have to meet this um filter or me sort of get over this hurdle of is this worth sacrificing something else for because you've convinced yourself that you're gonna have time for for everything when i was working as a journalist on a sort of day-to-day as a feature writer at the guardian um yeah the the better i got at doing stuff the more more efficient i got at doing stuff the the more i began to realize what i was really good at was doing stuff that didn't matter and that the things that i really cared about would just get endlessly postponed while i told myself yeah i was clearing the decks which was your original question and we could talk more about that but anyway i'll stop there for now no that's really cool um and i certainly know when when i clear the decks i actually get a little um like an endorphin rush for having done something like that the element of completeness but um and i don't want to perhaps address the more difficult task um but let's talk about um you talk about finitude and pronounce that correctly uh which which i've sort of summarized is acknowledging our mortality which sounds very a bit bleak but actually when you when you accept that and think about it it can be liberating perhaps you could talk about that concept you've you've coined i mean i didn't invent the word finitude people have people do wonder about how to pronounce it all i can say is in the audiobook for this i say finitude a lot so i really i really hope that's the right uh the right pronunciation i i just mean yes i this is a consequence of the fact that we die but i don't think that this book is really about you know it's not really about death and dying and mortality and that kind of very melodramatic kind of and very difficult uh aspect of human existence it's not about suggesting that anyone can sort of completely confront their mortality i don't think i certainly don't think i have um but rather the fact that our time is limited and that we are sort of material creatures in limited time with limited energy and limited attentional bandwidth and and all the rest of it the consequence of this i'm sort of wrapping up in this word finitude to refer to the state of being limited and therefore having to make by definition you know trade-offs and to exist in a world of opportunity costs and having to make tough decisions not being able to do all the things that we are you know psychologically able to think about and imagine not being able to meet all the demands that society might throw at us there's just no reason to assume that if we can think of something or somebody can ask something of us uh that there's capacity for it in a in a human in a human life uh uh beyond a certain point there won't be and uh these kind of sacrifices will just be be built into the situation so i think what i'm saying for a big chunk of the book is that like this is such an uncomfortable feeling that we pursue all sorts of uh ultimately counterproductive activities to sort of engage in emotional avoidance to feel like we're limitless when we're not i think that a lot of uh distraction is is based on is rooted in that we could talk about that if you like and i think a lot of time management stuff and certainly the years i spent as a sort of weirdo productivity geek um still am a little bit but you know recovering maybe they were it was about trying to achieve a kind of control over my time and my projects and my work in my life that would you know that subliminally would enable you not to have me not to have to confront this i think situation yeah you do you define distraction is motivated by the desire to try to flee something painful about our experience with the present which i quite which i quite liked and um we think about um well perhaps we could talk about the attention economy and how that feeds kind of our desire to be distracted and sort of be feel like we're achieving something whereas actually we're not achieving anything sure i mean i i don't know the individual details of people watching this but i don't feel that any of you are likely to need a sort of basic introduction to the idea of of the attention economy what i'm what i'm trying to explore in the book is well two points really firstly how the firstly that attention is so fundamental to the experience of life that calling it a resource like a limited resource people talk about it is almost uh a misnomer you know it's it there's a sense in which attention just is life and and what you pay attention to over the course of your life will sum up to what your life will have been so it's an incredibly uh serious thing to be involved with either as a user of technology or as or as someone working in uh digital technology but also secondly this thing that i don't think gets us enough attention which is you know i have many many criticisms of social media platforms and algorithmically driven you know attention mining effectively but but we talk a lot as if this is a sort of force that we i mean if you if you read a lot of stuff or you watch you know the social dilemma et cetera you you might be left with the impression that the the typical moment of digital distraction is one in which you know i'm sort of working away on a piece of writing and i'm feeling thrilled by it and it's so wonderful and i'm really enjoying myself and then um like somehow the the evil tendrils of silicon valley come and sort of grab me unwillingly away from my from my work and i do think that some of the tendrils of silicon valley are evil and that we should talk critically about them but that's not what happens what happens is i'm finding the work unpleasant or intimidating or boring or difficult and i am thrilled by the opportunity to go and scroll through down my phone for a bit instead and do something to leave or to leave aside something that i thought was what really mattered to me and go and do something that by definition if it's distraction like doesn't matter to me yeah and so i'm looking in the book at the idea that basically what's going on here is that that um you know it's not a coincidence that things that matter to us induce discomfort um they bring us up against the limits of our capacities and our ability to control how time unfolds you're writing a chapter of your novel you don't know that it's going to go well you don't know you've got what it takes you don't know that people will receive it well it might be forgotten or ignored or mocked you want to have an important difficult conversation with your spouse you don't know how it's going to unfold it might leave you feeling emotionally emotionally vulnerable it might lead to an angry exchange you know you can't you don't have that control it's precisely because these things matter that they evoke these uncomfortable feelings and then i think it feels absolutely wonderful to do something uh less important instead and to sort of zone out and i think the phenomenology of the internet is a super interesting part of this because actually these days we've always been distractible for these reasons but these days not only samuel johnson wrote about it but not only do we have reason to flee the stuff we care about because of discomfort but we have a place to go when we're fleeing it that phenomenologically speaking does feel kind of limitless it does feel like um a a realm where limits don't apply where you can portray yourself how you like find out about things that are happening thousands and thousands of miles away in virtually no time at all um it's very seductive as a as a as a way not to confront the the sort of limitations of being a human creature in time but i do think that ultimately it's only by confronting some of those limitations that we that we make progress on the things that we that we care about so it's uh getting finding some way to tolerate or accommodate or get friendly with that discomfort i think is a pretty much a superpower when it comes to thriving in the modern world no no i certainly struggle that i know every time i delete myself on purpose forget my password for social media i get distracted by the news or putting on the radio or something something else um well the second half of your book uh really speaks about the concept of time and how we how we define it and how we think about it i thought i might just read a small section which really spoke to me at the beginning of chapter eight sure um there's another sense in which treating time is something that we own and get to control seems to make life worse inevitably we become obsessed with using it well whereupon we discover an unfortunate truth the more you focus on using time well the more each day begins to feel like something you have to get through on route to some karma better more fulfilling point in the future which never actually arrives this this future chasing or i think you call it like the when i finally view of ourselves i mean is it is that just part of the human condition is that something we can we can acknowledge i know i know i'm always sort of doing something to get to the next stage um how do you how how have you thought about that and how we can for one of a better phrase live more in the moment yeah such a big question we can come to that because i i have thoughts about that but um yeah i think that um i i don't i think that an instrumental approach to experience right to using to to doing things now for some future gain is absolutely sort of you know as old as humanity nothing would ever get done if people couldn't sort of persevere to to do things and building civilization would never have would never have happened i think then once we all enter into this very instrumentalized notion of time that we were talking about at the beginning where we're all trying to use not only up the resources around us but we're thinking of time as a resource to use well then again it becomes something we have to do i wouldn't have written this book if i wasn't willing to instrumentalize time in a certain in a certain sense and nobody would ever get anything done in their in their professional lives if they didn't so i'm really talking about a kind of over investment in that stance a sense that i think is driven especially by the economic system that we live in and the stage that that's at now excuse me where it becomes the only form of value it all too easily that sort of instrumental mindset just sort of forces everything else out so so in other words you come to think about every moment of time only or pretty much only in terms of its value for some future moment of time and that when it's taken to that absolute place that that clearly is self-defeating and an irrational and and unfortunate uh way to be because it's um you know by definition you're going to you're placing the val the whole value of life constantly uh at some point that is not now and it only ever is now so you're never going to kind of cash out the value of life and find value in the moment so i think it's about sort of having the ability to take both of those perspectives it's certainly i don't recommend and i certainly have never retained myself the ability to care only about this precise moment um and not where it's leading but i think that you know over investment in that we see the effects of that all around us in sort of sapping the meaning from people's lives like what is this all for because they're aware on some level that what it's all for when they get to the time when it's supposedly all four it'll all still be for something in the future from then as well and and so on it felt like trying to find the fun in the moment and perhaps we you think about childhood where you know nursery leads to reception reception leads to this year and you know you're then working towards university and university more than job is for retirement and at which point is yeah at what point are you sort of having fun in the in the moment right right um perhaps you could um you talk about you know within within our con how we work with time and what we think about it um rediscovering rest and hobbies for the sake of it and perhaps you know when we think about having more fun do do we do enough things enough activities which we only do for their own sake you just moved to yorkshire where you probably have more opportunities to go for a walk in the in the in the countryside yeah i'm really i'm having a walk yeah i'm really putting my claims to the test here because i've got no excuse left anymore not to spend a significant chunk of my time hiking on the north york moors and uh so if i don't then i really am condemned uh as a as a failure of uh embracing the moment so we shall see i've been here two weeks i've been on a couple of hikes um i'll report back later um i think that um you know this instrumental this exclusive focus on the instrumental use of time uh is sort of at its most ironic in the context of leisure because like it's if you're even treating your leisure as a means to an end solely as a means to an end then like what what's left the the certainly the sort of ancient greek speaking broadly conception of leisure was that it was the the goal of everything else so you maybe had to work um and you maybe had to do all sorts of things but but but the reason you were doing them all was so that you could get the time the leisure time that was that was sort of life uh in its highest expression which admittedly for ancient philosophers tends to mean what you should do with that time is like philosophy they were that was a so that's not this doesn't necessarily follow but so i'm sort of making the case in the book for something that the the contemporary philosopher kieran satya has described as atylic activities things that you do not because of what they're leading up to or amounting to that are not defined by some kind of end point hiking is a fun example um just because um you know anyone who has any experience of enjoying a walk in the country knows you you probably drive the car to a car park somewhere and then you either go in a loop back to the car or you walk you know a few miles to a to an extreme point and turn around and come back if you wanted to do either of those things most efficiently the simplest way would just be not to go on the hike in the first place um all you're doing is getting getting back to where you started now there are instrumental benefits you know there are you can it's a it's good for your physical fitness uh you um might be like recording your route on all these social um apps for for you know now that enable you to share your um the views that you're gazing out over but basically you hike to hike and as cetera says you know there's not going to become a you're not going to get to a point in your life where you think um okay i've done all the hiking i'd aim to do that job is complete you are going to stop but you're not going to stop because you've reached the end of a project or exhausted an activity you're just going to stop because eventually you will or your interest might change or you may be too old and frail to continue or any number of things and that kind of i think that's i think that's what the the i think that's what is crystallized in the idea of a hobby and i think it's probably why the idea of a hobby feels a little bit cringe and embarrassing in the modern world right unlike as i say but unlike side hustles which are hobbies that have a very clear instrumental value that you're going to make money out of them and they are they are cool and hip and and it's good to have a side hustle it's kind of embarrassing to have a hobby and i think that that is at least in part because they don't fit and they are sort of culturally subversive in a way uh they don't they don't fit into this idea that everything has got to be for something else and quite possibly that something else is is financial profit but not necessarily it's just it's all for something other than itself and that's not true of uh you know of going on a hike um yeah so yeah that's that's that's very cool um i've written on my notes here um painting staring which uh i've not i've not yet had the time to go and find three hours to do this but perhaps you could talk about i've i've i haven't got the the name of the lady who suggested doing it but perhaps you could talk about that and what you found in in taking three hours out of the data stairs painting yeah totally i mean this is this is the part of the book where i'm writing about patience and impatience and i think that um one way to understand the feeling of impatience that is that is uh you know as ubiquitous today as ever it's another example of the way we rail against our limitation right and in that case it's the limitation of how fast we can force the rest of the world to to go um [Music] and this idea that certain activities just take the time they take and and sort of dictate their own speed and we just have to if we want to get the benefit of them we just have to fit around that instead of trying to constantly uh accelerate them up to the level where we would feel like we were the ones in control of them there's a art historian at harvard called uh jennifer roberts who um asks all her incoming students to do this exercise where they have to select a painting or a sculpture in the cambridge boston area and go and look at it for three hours straight um [Music] i think they're allowed to take bathroom breaks but that's it right it's just you just you you you sit there stand there i think you know folding chairs are useful here and um i looked at three hours and the point is you know she knows that's a crazily long amount of time but she knows that how people react to that her insight is that um it's very easy to think that you've seen a painting just because you've looked at it for a couple of seconds uh and that the tempo of life that her students are exposed to today through technology through the hyper-competitive atmosphere at universities like harvard and all the rest of it is such that like she needs to play a role as a teacher in deliberately making the tempo be much much much much slower to sort of make them go through the discomfort of staying in that one place to the point where you you can then see things you know i mean you really do see things in a painting if you look for that sort of absurdly long amount of time and i went to do this i went to meet her harvard and i sat at in the harvard art museums and did a and looked at a painting by uh dagar uh for three hours taking notes that's loud um and you know i spent the first half hour thinking i'd totally chosen the wrong painting i should have chosen something with more to look at which was just a manifestation of the impatience right and you go through then another hour of sort of all kinds of fidgety awful discomfort but on the other side of that you i genuinely did literally see things in this painting uh that i hadn't seen until then uh i'm not i'm not using c metaphorically to mean like i had thoughts about what it could mean i literally saw shadows and facial expressions and lines that seemed to suggest areas of space that i hadn't previously seen it's extraordinary and um it's just a sort of slightly extreme example of the benefit of letting something that you're engaged with take its time i think a more day-to-day example uh stop me if you want to be on something else but more day-to-day example of this is just like reading especially kind of reading fiction people me particularly right people say these days that they don't they can't find time to read that's a very common complaint and i think it's true to some extent but mainly i don't think people mean that they don't have a half hour in a 24-hour period when they could read a book some people are that busy but i think a lot of us are not it's that when we find that half hour and sit down with say a novel we don't we're too sort of um amped up and to running too fast to to slow down to the speed that reading a novel or reading a lot of non-fiction books too um requires so your sort of the flywheel is turning so fast that it feels really unpleasant to to slow it down so naturally you know people want to read summaries and synopsis or find techniques of speed reading to to bring reading up to the speed of of the the rest of life um and i think those do have some benefits for just sort of sheer information absorption but the real experience of reading a good book is just one that like there's a little amount of acceleration you can you can bring to it but beyond that it's just it just takes the time it takes it's given by the book the speed right it's not given by you you don't get to um dictate how fast it goes i guess just finally on this topic i always think it's so fascinating how as technology has made has caused it to take much much much less time to to do things that previously took a long time uh we actually get more and more impatient rather than less impatient yeah why is it so much more frustrating to wait eight seconds for a really badly slow loading web page than like three days to be sent some information in the mail it's like it shouldn't be that way we should be like feeling so relaxed and expansive about how much time we have and the idea i explore in the book is that part of what's going on here is just that we have now thanks to uh technological developments got to the point where it really does feel like we are almost able to do everything we want instantaneously almost able to cook our food in zero seconds flat because it only takes two minutes in the microwave almost able to find any information that we want uh you know with without any perceptible time delay and so in that situation of feeling like you are very nearly uh god it's way more frustrating to run up against the remaining ways in which you aren't you know the the fact that novels still take time to consume the fact that there are some slow loading web pages the fact that it does take two whole minutes uh to heat some food in the microwave instead of zero um if you work in an office with a microwave it's always been cancelled out at like seven seconds because i'm sure people tell themselves because their food was ready but actually i think it's because they're just like they couldn't wait they couldn't bear it anymore and that's the moment at which they were like ah screw this i'm just gonna take the food out because i cannot bring myself to wait these seconds it's really you know i i this is totally anecdotal but i think that people get um more impatient and angrier in in traffic in road traffic now that so much of our life is lived on smartphones operating at broadband speeds because i feel like it the contrast between uh so much of what we can do and the material obstacles of the cars in front just gets more and more pronounced and enraging i wondered if the pandemic had in any way exasperated that because we now do even more online when we're used to food being delivered as and when we want it that when we interact with the physical world yeah those frustrations i don't know a year of living inside i think has to an extent made us even more unaccepting of the slowness of the real world um could be yeah i don't know that and i think there are also advanced i think there are also things we see afresh and appreciate and value about the concrete material world as a result of the time you know the time in the pandemic but yeah it's certainly plausible definitely yeah uh if you have any questions uh whilst watching please add them in the in the chat window um we'll get to those after i've spoken uh asked you about well let's say that we have um embraced our finitude and we've decided which big rocks we want to put into our jar what are some tips that you would give us to start embracing this lifestyle what can we what can we actively do now to kind of to to be better at this it's a really good question yeah you should end the book you speak about yes it's a really good question i am a little bit conflicted about answering it because i do think that ultimately this is about a shift in perspective it is about seeing things differently i don't mean that i expect people to sort of read my book and have a sort of instant spiritual enlightenment experience i it can be a small perspective shift i think it is a so i think it is mainly about sort of feeling your way into this limit embracing mindset and what you find then sometimes is that it's really obvious what techniques or methods you should use to implement that or take one thing i've found for example is that you know productivity techniques i experimented with years ago but did so then in the spirit of trying to become the perfect controller of my time they're perfectly useful ways to organize the day now but i'm holding them much more loosely as a result of having felt my way somewhat into this this different mindset that said i definitely think there are some approaches to organizing work and life for example that that make more sense and that go with this mindset more than more than others one whole set of them is any kind of technique or approach to work that focuses on sort of serializing on sequent or making big projects sequential on getting closer to that state of doing one thing at a time whether that's literally on the level of the individual task or on the level of major projects sort of making most of them cue and line up behind one that you're focusing on now and moving it through and finishing it so the kanban approach to workflow management that i'm sure many people be familiar with uh there's a there's a great book called personal kanban by um jim benson and tony anne barry about applying this uh kind of that kind of approach which is obviously a team approach to your individual workflow there are lots of other ways i give a very simple one in the book about well let me stop and pause the point is all these things having progress all these things have in common is that they limit your work in progress they say okay here are the 40 things that feel like they matter and here are the three or so that i'm going to give my attention to and i'm not going to move on to the others until at least one of those three is is completed so you sort of bring yourself to live with the anxiety of knowing that all these other things are going uncompleted in order to bring something uh to completion and then just quickly you know i think i think all sort of time boxing and time blocking approaches can be well adapted to this to this mindset if you say i'm going to try to ring fence two or three hours of the morning for um sort of focused work that really matters to me and i'm going to try to limit my email processing time to an hour and a half towards the end of the day in both those cases what you're saying is you're not saying i'm going to finish this project today or i'm going to get to the bottom of my email today you're going time first you're saying i'm going to dedicate this amount of time to it i'm going to stop at the end of that time that's kind of a way of thinking about your schedule that really respects the finitude of your time instead of one that goes tasks first and says i've got to get through this whole list come what may and then you find you know that you're still at your desk at 11 p.m and the list just got twice as long during the course of day anyway i think you've actually if we can bring up julie julie's question i think you've actually kind of answered this uh so based on oliver's thoughts on the negativity of distraction i'm curious to hear his take on multitasking and how we can do it in a more time efficient manner i feel like you're saying don't do multitasking yeah i mean it's a little there's a there's some there are some subtleties here there are there's research that show you know certain forms of multitasking with using different kinds of attentional channels and stuff can be that can work i don't tell people they shouldn't listen to a podcast while they're doing the vacuuming or something you can you can combine tasks meaningfully in that way when it comes to our sort of focused focused attention on on sort of mentally taxing tasks um you basically just can't multitask anyway and if you think that you are doing what you're really doing is rapidly switching between things between keeping half an eye on your email inbox and a piece of writing you're trying to do say and calling it multitasking and i think that generally what happens there i think there are personality differences i don't want to tell people they definitely should never do it but generally what happens there if you have um you know three or four or five potential destinations for your attention at any moment is that as soon as any one of them gets difficult or challenging you just bounce off to one that's a bit easier and i think this probably especially happens more on the level of projects as opposed to tasks in other words to some degree manage your moment-to-moment tasks how you like but if you are really telling yourself that say in my case it could be three articles that i really care about if i'm really telling myself that all of those three are going to be kind of moved forward roughly at the same time or during the same period of time all that happens is that the moment one of them becomes difficult because guess what meaningful and important things feel difficult and uncomfortable you just move to the other one so you add you end up managing to make no progress on them because you're just sort of escaping the difficulty at each point so um you know it's not that you can't ever combine tasks or don't ever need to keep an eye on some on your email while doing something else but that like if you see what's going on there and you become more conscious of it you're much more likely to be able to avoid this situation of like not really doing anything because what you're actually doing in those contexts is pursuing the emotional feeling of being in control taking care of business having fingers in pies uh at the expense of getting things done that that you care about brilliant look let's take peter's question is this the midlife crisis book like this do you need to have changed extreme do you need to have chased extreme productivity first and having achieved common life goals family career financial to begin seeking a new perspective on time it's such a good question there's two interpretations of it right is it is this did this book emerge from my having a midlife crisis probably in some sense and then is it only useful for people who are at that stage and i i tried very consciously in in writing this book to not make it a book that was only uh beneficial to people who'd sort of exhausted all those techniques or perhaps what i mean is to point out certain truths about how those techniques work that might um that might accelerate uh a sort of profitable kind of crisis in someone who is uh you know uh in their 30s or their late 20s rather than in their 40s like me um i think there's some truth to this right i think that that that one of the easiest ways to uh understand the limitations of this kind of uh limit denying approach to life is to pursue it very energetically for a number of years and exhaust it and and realize that a different method is is required and i also think that many of the sort of things that people achieve in the first half of adulthood um which is often things like you know establishing themselves in a career separating off from their family of origin and being part of a of their own family um you know these things are can be done with and perhaps even sometimes catalyzed by a sort of unrealistic belief in the degree of your control over your life i guess i i guess i just end up by saying that i don't think it is ever um unhelpful to to see how reality is when it comes to time when it comes to our limitations i don't think it's something that you can only understand at a certain point in life and i don't think it's something that um that it's beneficial to sort of have kept from it to have kept from you as an earlier stage of life you know i'll be honest i think it would be i would be surprised if there were sort of 16 17 year olds who who thought that this book spoke to them i would be very gratified but i think it probably is something that comes from i also think that the age at which people encounter the sort of impossible demands of the world that we've created is clearly getting lower right the age of which people say the wage in which people complain about burnout i mean this is that burnout is a thing that people encounter in their 20s now judging by all sorts of reports and books and studies um not something that you have to have got into your sort of mid 50s uh before you've before you're sort of exhausted enough to encounter it so i think that hopefully the relevance of this the age at which this book is relevant to people is is falling as the uh as the world gets uh more and more insane with respect to timing the pace of acceleration is accelerating is healthy let's take mario's tour mario's question uh thanks to the talk my question is about attention span uh is there any reliable evidence on shortened attention spans as patients in the modern world uh is it real or is it a myth did you do any research on on this attention span is a really weird concept it's a very good question attention span is a really weird concept that i um have tried to understand and don't write about in the book because it just seems extremely uh it it sort of falls apart on on closer in inspection patience i think there's good reason to believe um that um that we sort of tolerate shorter and shorter amounts of time that it takes to do things or to have information communicated to us there's all sorts of fascinating longitudinal research on like the the length of edits in movies and the length of political speeches and uh sort of things like that that at least seem to be responding to a desire for um shorter and shorter bits of focus um i think that yeah i don't i i don't think that it's the most useful way to think about what's happening to our attention to think about that we are um less and less able to focus for extended periods of time i think it is probably more helpful and certainly more clearly true anyway that we are more and more tempted to abandon those focused periods of time and that there are more and more services and devices only too willing to you know use cutting-edge technology to keep us distracted once we have left those uh those that that focus for for distraction so it's in a way you're talking about attention span there but in a way you're talking about the sense that there are other possibilities and if you find yourself in a hut on a mountainside with no internet access and nothing to do but write your novel you're more likely to write your novel not because you've suddenly developed a long attention span but because um alternatives have been taken away from you the the sort of tormenting choice of other options is gone for a while yeah i find when i really need to get something done i will leave my phone and laptop home and take a notepad and a pen to a coffee shop and that's that i can't do anything else except yeah get through that yeah uh i'd love to know um how are you thinking about teaching this to your you have a son how are you thinking about teaching this how can we how can we what should we be teaching our children about this this concept such an interesting question and i don't feel like he's four turning five so i still really don't feel like i know what i'm doing when it comes to parenting and also he keeps getting older and changing so what anything i do learn becomes out of date um i you know i have been sort of fascinated and slightly dismayed just they obviously everyone says it's about kids right they reflect your your own personality back to you in ways that are often uncomfortable you know that when he started to sort of ask what we were doing next what we're doing next and trying to like get a schedule for the day into his head i was like oh my god i've really totally inculcated productivity geekhood uh into him and i'm hoping that uh you know i i think i see that being out here in uh more spending more time in nature is is something that sort of seeps into his uh bones i tell you what i think is the the most sort of uh daunting lesson that i have learned about inculcating lessons i guess is that uh you really have to do it yourself if you want the kid to do it too in other words you if you want to be if you want your child to grow up to be someone who isn't checking their phone every three seconds you have to not check your phone every three seconds and even more weirdly i think it's true that you have to not be i mean he doesn't have a phone but you know what i mean he's already he you know he's he's very interested by screens that are in the house and that's fine but i don't want him to be completely fixated by them not only do you have to be better at yourself in their presence but you sort of have to genuinely live it in your whole life even when they're in bed it's a really strange kind of uh almost kind of uh paranormal phenomenon or something right that like um you can't just uh put them to bed and then for two hours become a completely scattered uh terrible user of time or or something like that if you really want to model those lessons so that's what i'm sort of grappling with i don't want to make it sound entirely to do with screens that's just sort of everyone's always worrying about that so much but like to be present in the moment like i feel like the very best thing i can do is to be better at that and do you think do you think writing the book as a self-confessed um time management do you think writing the book has helped you become better at you know yeah no definitely i think lots of people sometimes assume the way books get written is you sort of have a great insight and then you set it down in in writing but for me the experience of the writing this book was that i did sort of have to as i discovered what i thought about time through writing it i did have to sort of become more of that become more of that person uh partly it's just accountability right i mean if i'm going to give some talk somewhere and someone spots me like impatiently freaking out about how like long the microwave is taking then i'm kind of it's pretty embarrassing but but more generally and more authentically you know it's just like no i i understand intellectually a huge number of things to be true now about time that i previously didn't and then the long haul is kind of living into those uh intellectual realizations and i've and i've done it somewhat and i've got a long way to go wonderful well oliver thank you so much for joining us today it's been it's been genuinely insightful i can't recommend the book enough available in audio you said you've done the audio book as well so yes that's available uh i have not done one of these talks and and put as many post-it notes inside it um as ever uh so yeah genuinely recommend uh is a great read for everyone a good use of one of your four thousand weeks i think was a quote i've stolen from another review online um thank you so on behalf of everyone watching now and in the future thank you so much for joining us hopefully one day for your next book you can join us in the office i will be delightful um otherwise oliver thank you so much for joining us today thank you it's been a pleasure i really enjoyed it and great questions thank you thank you [Music]

by oliver berkman author of 4 000 weeks time and how to use it uh oliver is the author of the antidote happiness for people who can't stand positive thinking and for many years wrote a popular weekly column on psychology for the guardian this column will change your life here's a devoted following for his writing on productivity mortality the power of limits and be building a meaningful life in an age of bewilderment uh please join me in thanking oliver for joining us today oliver hi thanks very much for inviting me this is great thank you so much for coming uh well look i am genuinely excited about talking to you uh three four four thousand weeks uh i i i've so many questions so many thoughts about it perhaps you could start by telling us what does four thousand weeks represent why why the why the title of the book so four thousand weeks is extremely approximately the average human lifespan in the west expressed in terms of weeks if you live to be 80 you'll have had a few more than that as i'm sure people can figure out it's pretty straightforward mental arithmetic but it's um i i completely rounded it to a uh to a sort of punchy round number it's it's it's basically how much we can reasonably expect to get to to get to play with in terms it feels like a very small number when represented in which indeed even those who live to be a hundred it's the order of six thousand weeks it's not it's not it's not a lot right no there's something very interesting about weeks because if you express it in days well it's it's a very large number if you press it in years it's very small but we get the scent we have the feeling that a year lasts goes on forever so it doesn't really matter it's that it's that middle zone where you're expressing it in a relatively small number of a quantity that nonetheless we feel is very brief and irrelevant in the course of our lives it doesn't seem like if you waste a week of your life it ought to matter yeah that's very cool um so the book broadly uh speaks about um how do we choose what we choose so that's we can kind of touch upon some of those those subjects um you open by talking about um acknowledging and embracing the the limit embracing life and how time has perhaps had a different meaning to people over the ages perhaps you could talk about that um and how we think about time now yeah sure i mean i think par part of what i find myself doing in talking about this book is is sort of deflecting a potential interpretation of that title i mean i'm glad i've we gave this book an attention grabbing title but there's a misinterpretation i think which would be like okay this is time is incredibly short therefore the only way to make the most use of of it is to live in a kind of white knuckle um very self-conscious and and strenuous attempt to sort of eke the most out of every day and you know do extreme sports every weekend and uh and uh you know never never lose a second and i think that actually what i'm trying to get at here is that there's a huge amount of relief as well as energy and motivation and focus that comes from acknowledging how limited we are with respect to time and thus seeing all the different ways in which we can talk about this i'm sure you know especially in kind of productivity culture and time management but not only all the ways in which we we we proceed as if we might find a way to fit everything in we might find a way to become so efficient as to not have to encounter the the ramifications of being finite so it's really about a sort of dropping back down to the ground and uh making time for a handful of things that really matter and giving up this impossible struggle to sort of uh be infinite with respect to time as opposed to this kind of very exhausting and rather stressful kind of carpe diem approach which you do see in popular culture which i think ultimately is actually just another form of the of the attitude that i'm uh criticizing uh in the book to go even further into sort of unseating our conventional views of time yes you're right i think there's lots of good evidence that the example i hear in the book is english medieval peasants although i think it would also apply to many different cultures at different times in history perhaps also to some indigenous cultures today that this whole notion of time as something separate from you time is as a resource that you have to use well or that you could be guilty of wasting or that you need to sort of save through efficiency techniques the whole conceptual basis of that distinction uh i think we can confidently say just wouldn't have occurred to a kind of working class laborer in early medieval england right um time for for them and for many other people it would have followed the patterns that anthropologists call task orientation right so instead of thinking about your activities as lined up against a schedule or a timeline or a calendar or something it's the tasks themselves that would have given the rhythm to the day time would have just been the medium in which your life unfolded rather than something that you could sort of psychologically objectify and then be tormented by or try to dominate or feel hounded by and you know the productivity guru who had gone up to a medieval farmer and said like why don't you uh do all the milking for the month uh all in one day to get it out of the way because batching your tasks is a really great way to to get more things done i mean obviously that would have been lunacy and still today it's essentially you know lunacy as an approach to milking cows because those things just need doing when they need doing and crops need harvesting when they need harvesting and you know i think we all or many of us have some experience of this kind of time i think that one very obvious example is in the first few months with a newborn baby but i think that you don't have to be a parent to have been in places where that kind of sense of the schedule the sense of the timetable falls away and you're just sort of in time uh it has its disadvantages because you you can't build a sort of industrial technologically advanced society without without um that objectified idea of time but it has some big advantages as well which are a kind of peace of mind that i think is a lot harder for us to access uh today it was um you spoke about when you um time used to be measured in how long it takes to do a task so having to take instead of just using a minute or an hour you'd say all the time it takes to bring in the hair or milk the cat bring the hair milk out it actually made me think of i have a i have a five-year-old daughter and we measure time in the length of her favorite tv shows like how long would it take to get to this bus stop well at the time it takes to watch two of these shows so actually for children who don't understand minutes and hours we still use task based times i thought was quite interesting yeah no it's fascinating and even that kind of comparison like i don't think that would have been the normal way of talking my understanding of the literature is it wouldn't have been a normal way of talking about time it's just that when you had to do some comparing like there wasn't the widespread notion there wasn't the white there wasn't a sort of um widespread adoption of clocks or of time measuring devices among ordinary people so yeah you just have to grasp for some other for some other task as a as a comparator and you know people tend to think that life moved more slowly back then as another example of this but i think that probably that concept of life moving slowly would have been the thing that didn't make sense if you sort of time travel back to medieval england it's not that life moved more slowly but just like what slowly as compared to watch i mean it's just life it's just unfolding it's only a sort of post-industrialization that it is ubiquitous uh to think about life unfolding according to something that isn't life uh a time a timeline or a yardstick um you get it in ancient greece and rome like you get all sorts of things but it's that's a that's a new thing for for almost everybody in the world to be um thinking as a way of governing their lives and perhaps post internet we not only compare ourselves to how much we can family today but how much others are able or seem to be able to cram into a day and so the question of oh how do i do all of the things it's not just all of those those those big rocks that i want to accomplish but that others seem to be doing which i think uh perhaps you could talk about your dislike of the big rocks parable which for those i imagine that many those dudes but for those who don't know it's the it's it's how do you fit the big rocks the small box and the sand into a jar the idea being you have to put the big rocks in first and then the smaller things can fit around those but you dislike that for a very good reason well this is a metaphor for prioritization and it says you know if you want to have time to do everything that counts just make sure you make time first for the things that that really matter um yeah i mean i i think there is some wisdom in here but but the my basic objection is that this is a this is a rigged experiment the uh the person in the in the parable who is bringing these rocks and pebbles and sand into the classroom or seminar room or whether it's supposed to happen has only brought enough rocks uh that he knows in advance will will fit into the jar um and i don't think that our primary problem on the level of individual time management today is that we prioritize things badly although we do i think it is that there are too many big rocks there are too many things that genuinely matter and you know if we had 40 hours in a day we could still fill that time with things that genuinely matter it it isn't that if you find the right tricks and techniques you'll be able to get rid of only all the unimportant tedious stuff and then spend your life in this kind of unfolding of just pure meaningfulness and feel like you're doing everything it's like no you're gonna have to not do lots of things that do matter uh in order to make time for the things that you that you care about the most out of those out of those things let's talk about the efficiency traps so you talk about uh the the curse perhaps of clearing the decks we all come in and i've seen people block out the first hour of their calendars to clear emails you talk about how that actually creates more work right i mean this is something that i'm sure a number of people watching will be familiar with in in other contexts right this general idea which crops up as all sorts of other paradoxes the jevons paradox in in energy efficiency and a bunch of others but if you make a system more efficient without regard to any other governing value you just pursue greater efficiency in processing things through the system then all else being equal the system will fill with more and more stuff rather than bringing peace of mind and will or um or like empty time or capacity and it will um fill with with more and more junk rather than uh good stuff so applied to time management the idea here is you know if you get incredibly good at processing your email all else being equal what will happen is you'll just get more email uh because you'll reply to people and they'll reply to you and those replies will generate replies and they'll go forever you get a reputation for being responsive to email so more people will reach out to email you and just in general email unless it's stopped by some other act on your part email will just come to dominate your life more and more in direct contradiction to your motive initial motivation to uh to sort of bring email under control this is you know this is parkinson's law work expands to fill the time available for its completion um it's that thing where they widen motorways to relieve traffic congestion and it makes the uh it provides an added incentive for more drivers to use that route and so the the congestion sort of tends gradually back towards where it originally was so when i'm talking about the efficiency trap i'm talking about a thing which i think is encouraged by a lot of sort of less good productivity advice and productivity culture which is this idea that there is some inherent benefit in just getting more efficient at doing more things in a smaller amount of time firstly there's no benefit in doing things per se unless they're the good the right things to do and then secondly yeah you get into this problem where where um the more stuff that comes across your radar the the more likely you are to accept additional things to do that actually aren't worth your time because none of these incoming things will have to meet this um filter or me sort of get over this hurdle of is this worth sacrificing something else for because you've convinced yourself that you're gonna have time for for everything when i was working as a journalist on a sort of day-to-day as a feature writer at the guardian um yeah the the better i got at doing stuff the more more efficient i got at doing stuff the the more i began to realize what i was really good at was doing stuff that didn't matter and that the things that i really cared about would just get endlessly postponed while i told myself yeah i was clearing the decks which was your original question and we could talk more about that but anyway i'll stop there for now no that's really cool um and i certainly know when when i clear the decks i actually get a little um like an endorphin rush for having done something like that the element of completeness but um and i don't want to perhaps address the more difficult task um but let's talk about um you talk about finitude and pronounce that correctly uh which which i've sort of summarized is acknowledging our mortality which sounds very a bit bleak but actually when you when you accept that and think about it it can be liberating perhaps you could talk about that concept you've you've coined i mean i didn't invent the word finitude people have people do wonder about how to pronounce it all i can say is in the audiobook for this i say finitude a lot so i really i really hope that's the right uh the right pronunciation i i just mean yes i this is a consequence of the fact that we die but i don't think that this book is really about you know it's not really about death and dying and mortality and that kind of very melodramatic kind of and very difficult uh aspect of human existence it's not about suggesting that anyone can sort of completely confront their mortality i don't think i certainly don't think i have um but rather the fact that our time is limited and that we are sort of material creatures in limited time with limited energy and limited attentional bandwidth and and all the rest of it the consequence of this i'm sort of wrapping up in this word finitude to refer to the state of being limited and therefore having to make by definition you know trade-offs and to exist in a world of opportunity costs and having to make tough decisions not being able to do all the things that we are you know psychologically able to think about and imagine not being able to meet all the demands that society might throw at us there's just no reason to assume that if we can think of something or somebody can ask something of us uh that there's capacity for it in a in a human in a human life uh uh beyond a certain point there won't be and uh these kind of sacrifices will just be be built into the situation so i think what i'm saying for a big chunk of the book is that like this is such an uncomfortable feeling that we pursue all sorts of uh ultimately counterproductive activities to sort of engage in emotional avoidance to feel like we're limitless when we're not i think that a lot of uh distraction is is based on is rooted in that we could talk about that if you like and i think a lot of time management stuff and certainly the years i spent as a sort of weirdo productivity geek um still am a little bit but you know recovering maybe they were it was about trying to achieve a kind of control over my time and my projects and my work in my life that would you know that subliminally would enable you not to have me not to have to confront this i think situation yeah you do you define distraction is motivated by the desire to try to flee something painful about our experience with the present which i quite which i quite liked and um we think about um well perhaps we could talk about the attention economy and how that feeds kind of our desire to be distracted and sort of be feel like we're achieving something whereas actually we're not achieving anything sure i mean i i don't know the individual details of people watching this but i don't feel that any of you are likely to need a sort of basic introduction to the idea of of the attention economy what i'm what i'm trying to explore in the book is well two points really firstly how the firstly that attention is so fundamental to the experience of life that calling it a resource like a limited resource people talk about it is almost uh a misnomer you know it's it there's a sense in which attention just is life and and what you pay attention to over the course of your life will sum up to what your life will have been so it's an incredibly uh serious thing to be involved with either as a user of technology or as or as someone working in uh digital technology but also secondly this thing that i don't think gets us enough attention which is you know i have many many criticisms of social media platforms and algorithmically driven you know attention mining effectively but but we talk a lot as if this is a sort of force that we i mean if you if you read a lot of stuff or you watch you know the social dilemma et cetera you you might be left with the impression that the the typical moment of digital distraction is one in which you know i'm sort of working away on a piece of writing and i'm feeling thrilled by it and it's so wonderful and i'm really enjoying myself and then um like somehow the the evil tendrils of silicon valley come and sort of grab me unwillingly away from my from my work and i do think that some of the tendrils of silicon valley are evil and that we should talk critically about them but that's not what happens what happens is i'm finding the work unpleasant or intimidating or boring or difficult and i am thrilled by the opportunity to go and scroll through down my phone for a bit instead and do something to leave or to leave aside something that i thought was what really mattered to me and go and do something that by definition if it's distraction like doesn't matter to me yeah and so i'm looking in the book at the idea that basically what's going on here is that that um you know it's not a coincidence that things that matter to us induce discomfort um they bring us up against the limits of our capacities and our ability to control how time unfolds you're writing a chapter of your novel you don't know that it's going to go well you don't know you've got what it takes you don't know that people will receive it well it might be forgotten or ignored or mocked you want to have an important difficult conversation with your spouse you don't know how it's going to unfold it might leave you feeling emotionally emotionally vulnerable it might lead to an angry exchange you know you can't you don't have that control it's precisely because these things matter that they evoke these uncomfortable feelings and then i think it feels absolutely wonderful to do something uh less important instead and to sort of zone out and i think the phenomenology of the internet is a super interesting part of this because actually these days we've always been distractible for these reasons but these days not only samuel johnson wrote about it but not only do we have reason to flee the stuff we care about because of discomfort but we have a place to go when we're fleeing it that phenomenologically speaking does feel kind of limitless it does feel like um a a realm where limits don't apply where you can portray yourself how you like find out about things that are happening thousands and thousands of miles away in virtually no time at all um it's very seductive as a as a as a way not to confront the the sort of limitations of being a human creature in time but i do think that ultimately it's only by confronting some of those limitations that we that we make progress on the things that we that we care about so it's uh getting finding some way to tolerate or accommodate or get friendly with that discomfort i think is a pretty much a superpower when it comes to thriving in the modern world no no i certainly struggle that i know every time i delete myself on purpose forget my password for social media i get distracted by the news or putting on the radio or something something else um well the second half of your book uh really speaks about the concept of time and how we how we define it and how we think about it i thought i might just read a small section which really spoke to me at the beginning of chapter eight sure um there's another sense in which treating time is something that we own and get to control seems to make life worse inevitably we become obsessed with using it well whereupon we discover an unfortunate truth the more you focus on using time well the more each day begins to feel like something you have to get through on route to some karma better more fulfilling point in the future which never actually arrives this this future chasing or i think you call it like the when i finally view of ourselves i mean is it is that just part of the human condition is that something we can we can acknowledge i know i know i'm always sort of doing something to get to the next stage um how do you how how have you thought about that and how we can for one of a better phrase live more in the moment yeah such a big question we can come to that because i i have thoughts about that but um yeah i think that um i i don't i think that an instrumental approach to experience right to using to to doing things now for some future gain is absolutely sort of you know as old as humanity nothing would ever get done if people couldn't sort of persevere to to do things and building civilization would never have would never have happened i think then once we all enter into this very instrumentalized notion of time that we were talking about at the beginning where we're all trying to use not only up the resources around us but we're thinking of time as a resource to use well then again it becomes something we have to do i wouldn't have written this book if i wasn't willing to instrumentalize time in a certain in a certain sense and nobody would ever get anything done in their in their professional lives if they didn't so i'm really talking about a kind of over investment in that stance a sense that i think is driven especially by the economic system that we live in and the stage that that's at now excuse me where it becomes the only form of value it all too easily that sort of instrumental mindset just sort of forces everything else out so so in other words you come to think about every moment of time only or pretty much only in terms of its value for some future moment of time and that when it's taken to that absolute place that that clearly is self-defeating and an irrational and and unfortunate uh way to be because it's um you know by definition you're going to you're placing the val the whole value of life constantly uh at some point that is not now and it only ever is now so you're never going to kind of cash out the value of life and find value in the moment so i think it's about sort of having the ability to take both of those perspectives it's certainly i don't recommend and i certainly have never retained myself the ability to care only about this precise moment um and not where it's leading but i think that you know over investment in that we see the effects of that all around us in sort of sapping the meaning from people's lives like what is this all for because they're aware on some level that what it's all for when they get to the time when it's supposedly all four it'll all still be for something in the future from then as well and and so on it felt like trying to find the fun in the moment and perhaps we you think about childhood where you know nursery leads to reception reception leads to this year and you know you're then working towards university and university more than job is for retirement and at which point is yeah at what point are you sort of having fun in the in the moment right right um perhaps you could um you talk about you know within within our con how we work with time and what we think about it um rediscovering rest and hobbies for the sake of it and perhaps you know when we think about having more fun do do we do enough things enough activities which we only do for their own sake you just moved to yorkshire where you probably have more opportunities to go for a walk in the in the in the countryside yeah i'm really i'm having a walk yeah i'm really putting my claims to the test here because i've got no excuse left anymore not to spend a significant chunk of my time hiking on the north york moors and uh so if i don't then i really am condemned uh as a as a failure of uh embracing the moment so we shall see i've been here two weeks i've been on a couple of hikes um i'll report back later um i think that um you know this instrumental this exclusive focus on the instrumental use of time uh is sort of at its most ironic in the context of leisure because like it's if you're even treating your leisure as a means to an end solely as a means to an end then like what what's left the the certainly the sort of ancient greek speaking broadly conception of leisure was that it was the the goal of everything else so you maybe had to work um and you maybe had to do all sorts of things but but but the reason you were doing them all was so that you could get the time the leisure time that was that was sort of life uh in its highest expression which admittedly for ancient philosophers tends to mean what you should do with that time is like philosophy they were that was a so that's not this doesn't necessarily follow but so i'm sort of making the case in the book for something that the the contemporary philosopher kieran satya has described as atylic activities things that you do not because of what they're leading up to or amounting to that are not defined by some kind of end point hiking is a fun example um just because um you know anyone who has any experience of enjoying a walk in the country knows you you probably drive the car to a car park somewhere and then you either go in a loop back to the car or you walk you know a few miles to a to an extreme point and turn around and come back if you wanted to do either of those things most efficiently the simplest way would just be not to go on the hike in the first place um all you're doing is getting getting back to where you started now there are instrumental benefits you know there are you can it's a it's good for your physical fitness uh you um might be like recording your route on all these social um apps for for you know now that enable you to share your um the views that you're gazing out over but basically you hike to hike and as cetera says you know there's not going to become a you're not going to get to a point in your life where you think um okay i've done all the hiking i'd aim to do that job is complete you are going to stop but you're not going to stop because you've reached the end of a project or exhausted an activity you're just going to stop because eventually you will or your interest might change or you may be too old and frail to continue or any number of things and that kind of i think that's i think that's what the the i think that's what is crystallized in the idea of a hobby and i think it's probably why the idea of a hobby feels a little bit cringe and embarrassing in the modern world right unlike as i say but unlike side hustles which are hobbies that have a very clear instrumental value that you're going to make money out of them and they are they are cool and hip and and it's good to have a side hustle it's kind of embarrassing to have a hobby and i think that that is at least in part because they don't fit and they are sort of culturally subversive in a way uh they don't they don't fit into this idea that everything has got to be for something else and quite possibly that something else is is financial profit but not necessarily it's just it's all for something other than itself and that's not true of uh you know of going on a hike um yeah so yeah that's that's that's very cool um i've written on my notes here um painting staring which uh i've not i've not yet had the time to go and find three hours to do this but perhaps you could talk about i've i've i haven't got the the name of the lady who suggested doing it but perhaps you could talk about that and what you found in in taking three hours out of the data stairs painting yeah totally i mean this is this is the part of the book where i'm writing about patience and impatience and i think that um one way to understand the feeling of impatience that is that is uh you know as ubiquitous today as ever it's another example of the way we rail against our limitation right and in that case it's the limitation of how fast we can force the rest of the world to to go um [Music] and this idea that certain activities just take the time they take and and sort of dictate their own speed and we just have to if we want to get the benefit of them we just have to fit around that instead of trying to constantly uh accelerate them up to the level where we would feel like we were the ones in control of them there's a art historian at harvard called uh jennifer roberts who um asks all her incoming students to do this exercise where they have to select a painting or a sculpture in the cambridge boston area and go and look at it for three hours straight um [Music] i think they're allowed to take bathroom breaks but that's it right it's just you just you you you sit there stand there i think you know folding chairs are useful here and um i looked at three hours and the point is you know she knows that's a crazily long amount of time but she knows that how people react to that her insight is that um it's very easy to think that you've seen a painting just because you've looked at it for a couple of seconds uh and that the tempo of life that her students are exposed to today through technology through the hyper-competitive atmosphere at universities like harvard and all the rest of it is such that like she needs to play a role as a teacher in deliberately making the tempo be much much much much slower to sort of make them go through the discomfort of staying in that one place to the point where you you can then see things you know i mean you really do see things in a painting if you look for that sort of absurdly long amount of time and i went to do this i went to meet her harvard and i sat at in the harvard art museums and did a and looked at a painting by uh dagar uh for three hours taking notes that's loud um and you know i spent the first half hour thinking i'd totally chosen the wrong painting i should have chosen something with more to look at which was just a manifestation of the impatience right and you go through then another hour of sort of all kinds of fidgety awful discomfort but on the other side of that you i genuinely did literally see things in this painting uh that i hadn't seen until then uh i'm not i'm not using c metaphorically to mean like i had thoughts about what it could mean i literally saw shadows and facial expressions and lines that seemed to suggest areas of space that i hadn't previously seen it's extraordinary and um it's just a sort of slightly extreme example of the benefit of letting something that you're engaged with take its time i think a more day-to-day example uh stop me if you want to be on something else but more day-to-day example of this is just like reading especially kind of reading fiction people me particularly right people say these days that they don't they can't find time to read that's a very common complaint and i think it's true to some extent but mainly i don't think people mean that they don't have a half hour in a 24-hour period when they could read a book some people are that busy but i think a lot of us are not it's that when we find that half hour and sit down with say a novel we don't we're too sort of um amped up and to running too fast to to slow down to the speed that reading a novel or reading a lot of non-fiction books too um requires so your sort of the flywheel is turning so fast that it feels really unpleasant to to slow it down so naturally you know people want to read summaries and synopsis or find techniques of speed reading to to bring reading up to the speed of of the the rest of life um and i think those do have some benefits for just sort of sheer information absorption but the real experience of reading a good book is just one that like there's a little amount of acceleration you can you can bring to it but beyond that it's just it just takes the time it takes it's given by the book the speed right it's not given by you you don't get to um dictate how fast it goes i guess just finally on this topic i always think it's so fascinating how as technology has made has caused it to take much much much less time to to do things that previously took a long time uh we actually get more and more impatient rather than less impatient yeah why is it so much more frustrating to wait eight seconds for a really badly slow loading web page than like three days to be sent some information in the mail it's like it shouldn't be that way we should be like feeling so relaxed and expansive about how much time we have and the idea i explore in the book is that part of what's going on here is just that we have now thanks to uh technological developments got to the point where it really does feel like we are almost able to do everything we want instantaneously almost able to cook our food in zero seconds flat because it only takes two minutes in the microwave almost able to find any information that we want uh you know with without any perceptible time delay and so in that situation of feeling like you are very nearly uh god it's way more frustrating to run up against the remaining ways in which you aren't you know the the fact that novels still take time to consume the fact that there are some slow loading web pages the fact that it does take two whole minutes uh to heat some food in the microwave instead of zero um if you work in an office with a microwave it's always been cancelled out at like seven seconds because i'm sure people tell themselves because their food was ready but actually i think it's because they're just like they couldn't wait they couldn't bear it anymore and that's the moment at which they were like ah screw this i'm just gonna take the food out because i cannot bring myself to wait these seconds it's really you know i i this is totally anecdotal but i think that people get um more impatient and angrier in in traffic in road traffic now that so much of our life is lived on smartphones operating at broadband speeds because i feel like it the contrast between uh so much of what we can do and the material obstacles of the cars in front just gets more and more pronounced and enraging i wondered if the pandemic had in any way exasperated that because we now do even more online when we're used to food being delivered as and when we want it that when we interact with the physical world yeah those frustrations i don't know a year of living inside i think has to an extent made us even more unaccepting of the slowness of the real world um could be yeah i don't know that and i think there are also advanced i think there are also things we see afresh and appreciate and value about the concrete material world as a result of the time you know the time in the pandemic but yeah it's certainly plausible definitely yeah uh if you have any questions uh whilst watching please add them in the in the chat window um we'll get to those after i've spoken uh asked you about well let's say that we have um embraced our finitude and we've decided which big rocks we want to put into our jar what are some tips that you would give us to start embracing this lifestyle what can we what can we actively do now to kind of to to be better at this it's a really good question yeah you should end the book you speak about yes it's a really good question i am a little bit conflicted about answering it because i do think that ultimately this is about a shift in perspective it is about seeing things differently i don't mean that i expect people to sort of read my book and have a sort of instant spiritual enlightenment experience i it can be a small perspective shift i think it is a so i think it is mainly about sort of feeling your way into this limit embracing mindset and what you find then sometimes is that it's really obvious what techniques or methods you should use to implement that or take one thing i've found for example is that you know productivity techniques i experimented with years ago but did so then in the spirit of trying to become the perfect controller of my time they're perfectly useful ways to organize the day now but i'm holding them much more loosely as a result of having felt my way somewhat into this this different mindset that said i definitely think there are some approaches to organizing work and life for example that that make more sense and that go with this mindset more than more than others one whole set of them is any kind of technique or approach to work that focuses on sort of serializing on sequent or making big projects sequential on getting closer to that state of doing one thing at a time whether that's literally on the level of the individual task or on the level of major projects sort of making most of them cue and line up behind one that you're focusing on now and moving it through and finishing it so the kanban approach to workflow management that i'm sure many people be familiar with uh there's a there's a great book called personal kanban by um jim benson and tony anne barry about applying this uh kind of that kind of approach which is obviously a team approach to your individual workflow there are lots of other ways i give a very simple one in the book about well let me stop and pause the point is all these things having progress all these things have in common is that they limit your work in progress they say okay here are the 40 things that feel like they matter and here are the three or so that i'm going to give my attention to and i'm not going to move on to the others until at least one of those three is is completed so you sort of bring yourself to live with the anxiety of knowing that all these other things are going uncompleted in order to bring something uh to completion and then just quickly you know i think i think all sort of time boxing and time blocking approaches can be well adapted to this to this mindset if you say i'm going to try to ring fence two or three hours of the morning for um sort of focused work that really matters to me and i'm going to try to limit my email processing time to an hour and a half towards the end of the day in both those cases what you're saying is you're not saying i'm going to finish this project today or i'm going to get to the bottom of my email today you're going time first you're saying i'm going to dedicate this amount of time to it i'm going to stop at the end of that time that's kind of a way of thinking about your schedule that really respects the finitude of your time instead of one that goes tasks first and says i've got to get through this whole list come what may and then you find you know that you're still at your desk at 11 p.m and the list just got twice as long during the course of day anyway i think you've actually if we can bring up julie julie's question i think you've actually kind of answered this uh so based on oliver's thoughts on the negativity of distraction i'm curious to hear his take on multitasking and how we can do it in a more time efficient manner i feel like you're saying don't do multitasking yeah i mean it's a little there's a there's some there are some subtleties here there are there's research that show you know certain forms of multitasking with using different kinds of attentional channels and stuff can be that can work i don't tell people they shouldn't listen to a podcast while they're doing the vacuuming or something you can you can combine tasks meaningfully in that way when it comes to our sort of focused focused attention on on sort of mentally taxing tasks um you basically just can't multitask anyway and if you think that you are doing what you're really doing is rapidly switching between things between keeping half an eye on your email inbox and a piece of writing you're trying to do say and calling it multitasking and i think that generally what happens there i think there are personality differences i don't want to tell people they definitely should never do it but generally what happens there if you have um you know three or four or five potential destinations for your attention at any moment is that as soon as any one of them gets difficult or challenging you just bounce off to one that's a bit easier and i think this probably especially happens more on the level of projects as opposed to tasks in other words to some degree manage your moment-to-moment tasks how you like but if you are really telling yourself that say in my case it could be three articles that i really care about if i'm really telling myself that all of those three are going to be kind of moved forward roughly at the same time or during the same period of time all that happens is that the moment one of them becomes difficult because guess what meaningful and important things feel difficult and uncomfortable you just move to the other one so you add you end up managing to make no progress on them because you're just sort of escaping the difficulty at each point so um you know it's not that you can't ever combine tasks or don't ever need to keep an eye on some on your email while doing something else but that like if you see what's going on there and you become more conscious of it you're much more likely to be able to avoid this situation of like not really doing anything because what you're actually doing in those contexts is pursuing the emotional feeling of being in control taking care of business having fingers in pies uh at the expense of getting things done that that you care about brilliant look let's take peter's question is this the midlife crisis book like this do you need to have changed extreme do you need to have chased extreme productivity first and having achieved common life goals family career financial to begin seeking a new perspective on time it's such a good question there's two interpretations of it right is it is this did this book emerge from my having a midlife crisis probably in some sense and then is it only useful for people who are at that stage and i i tried very consciously in in writing this book to not make it a book that was only uh beneficial to people who'd sort of exhausted all those techniques or perhaps what i mean is to point out certain truths about how those techniques work that might um that might accelerate uh a sort of profitable kind of crisis in someone who is uh you know uh in their 30s or their late 20s rather than in their 40s like me um i think there's some truth to this right i think that that that one of the easiest ways to uh understand the limitations of this kind of uh limit denying approach to life is to pursue it very energetically for a number of years and exhaust it and and realize that a different method is is required and i also think that many of the sort of things that people achieve in the first half of adulthood um which is often things like you know establishing themselves in a career separating off from their family of origin and being part of a of their own family um you know these things are can be done with and perhaps even sometimes catalyzed by a sort of unrealistic belief in the degree of your control over your life i guess i i guess i just end up by saying that i don't think it is ever um unhelpful to to see how reality is when it comes to time when it comes to our limitations i don't think it's something that you can only understand at a certain point in life and i don't think it's something that um that it's beneficial to sort of have kept from it to have kept from you as an earlier stage of life you know i'll be honest i think it would be i would be surprised if there were sort of 16 17 year olds who who thought that this book spoke to them i would be very gratified but i think it probably is something that comes from i also think that the age at which people encounter the sort of impossible demands of the world that we've created is clearly getting lower right the age of which people say the wage in which people complain about burnout i mean this is that burnout is a thing that people encounter in their 20s now judging by all sorts of reports and books and studies um not something that you have to have got into your sort of mid 50s uh before you've before you're sort of exhausted enough to encounter it so i think that hopefully the relevance of this the age at which this book is relevant to people is is falling as the uh as the world gets uh more and more insane with respect to timing the pace of acceleration is accelerating is healthy let's take mario's tour mario's question uh thanks to the talk my question is about attention span uh is there any reliable evidence on shortened attention spans as patients in the modern world uh is it real or is it a myth did you do any research on on this attention span is a really weird concept it's a very good question attention span is a really weird concept that i um have tried to understand and don't write about in the book because it just seems extremely uh it it sort of falls apart on on closer in inspection patience i think there's good reason to believe um that um that we sort of tolerate shorter and shorter amounts of time that it takes to do things or to have information communicated to us there's all sorts of fascinating longitudinal research on like the the length of edits in movies and the length of political speeches and uh sort of things like that that at least seem to be responding to a desire for um shorter and shorter bits of focus um i think that yeah i don't i i don't think that it's the most useful way to think about what's happening to our attention to think about that we are um less and less able to focus for extended periods of time i think it is probably more helpful and certainly more clearly true anyway that we are more and more tempted to abandon those focused periods of time and that there are more and more services and devices only too willing to you know use cutting-edge technology to keep us distracted once we have left those uh those that that focus for for distraction so it's in a way you're talking about attention span there but in a way you're talking about the sense that there are other possibilities and if you find yourself in a hut on a mountainside with no internet access and nothing to do but write your novel you're more likely to write your novel not because you've suddenly developed a long attention span but because um alternatives have been taken away from you the the sort of tormenting choice of other options is gone for a while yeah i find when i really need to get something done i will leave my phone and laptop home and take a notepad and a pen to a coffee shop and that's that i can't do anything else except yeah get through that yeah uh i'd love to know um how are you thinking about teaching this to your you have a son how are you thinking about teaching this how can we how can we what should we be teaching our children about this this concept such an interesting question and i don't feel like he's four turning five so i still really don't feel like i know what i'm doing when it comes to parenting and also he keeps getting older and changing so what anything i do learn becomes out of date um i you know i have been sort of fascinated and slightly dismayed just they obviously everyone says it's about kids right they reflect your your own personality back to you in ways that are often uncomfortable you know that when he started to sort of ask what we were doing next what we're doing next and trying to like get a schedule for the day into his head i was like oh my god i've really totally inculcated productivity geekhood uh into him and i'm hoping that uh you know i i think i see that being out here in uh more spending more time in nature is is something that sort of seeps into his uh bones i tell you what i think is the the most sort of uh daunting lesson that i have learned about inculcating lessons i guess is that uh you really have to do it yourself if you want the kid to do it too in other words you if you want to be if you want your child to grow up to be someone who isn't checking their phone every three seconds you have to not check your phone every three seconds and even more weirdly i think it's true that you have to not be i mean he doesn't have a phone but you know what i mean he's already he you know he's he's very interested by screens that are in the house and that's fine but i don't want him to be completely fixated by them not only do you have to be better at yourself in their presence but you sort of have to genuinely live it in your whole life even when they're in bed it's a really strange kind of uh almost kind of uh paranormal phenomenon or something right that like um you can't just uh put them to bed and then for two hours become a completely scattered uh terrible user of time or or something like that if you really want to model those lessons so that's what i'm sort of grappling with i don't want to make it sound entirely to do with screens that's just sort of everyone's always worrying about that so much but like to be present in the moment like i feel like the very best thing i can do is to be better at that and do you think do you think writing the book as a self-confessed um time management do you think writing the book has helped you become better at you know yeah no definitely i think lots of people sometimes assume the way books get written is you sort of have a great insight and then you set it down in in writing but for me the experience of the writing this book was that i did sort of have to as i discovered what i thought about time through writing it i did have to sort of become more of that become more of that person uh partly it's just accountability right i mean if i'm going to give some talk somewhere and someone spots me like impatiently freaking out about how like long the microwave is taking then i'm kind of it's pretty embarrassing but but more generally and more authentically you know it's just like no i i understand intellectually a huge number of things to be true now about time that i previously didn't and then the long haul is kind of living into those uh intellectual realizations and i've and i've done it somewhat and i've got a long way to go wonderful well oliver thank you so much for joining us today it's been it's been genuinely insightful i can't recommend the book enough available in audio you said you've done the audio book as well so yes that's available uh i have not done one of these talks and and put as many post-it notes inside it um as ever uh so yeah genuinely recommend uh is a great read for everyone a good use of one of your four thousand weeks i think was a quote i've stolen from another review online um thank you so on behalf of everyone watching now and in the future thank you so much for joining us hopefully one day for your next book you can join us in the office i will be delightful um otherwise oliver thank you so much for joining us today thank you it's been a pleasure i really enjoyed it and great questions thank you thank you [Music]

by oliver berkman author of 4 000 weeks time and how to use it uh oliver is the author of the antidote happiness for people who can't stand positive thinking and for many years wrote a popular weekly column on psychology for the guardian this column will change your life here's a devoted following for his writing on productivity mortality the power of limits and be building a meaningful life in an age of bewilderment uh please join me in thanking oliver for joining us today oliver hi thanks very much for inviting me this is great thank you so much for coming uh well look i am genuinely excited about talking to you uh three four four thousand weeks uh i i i've so many questions so many thoughts about it perhaps you could start by telling us what does four thousand weeks represent why why the why the title of the book so four thousand weeks is extremely approximately the average human lifespan in the west expressed in terms of weeks if you live to be 80 you'll have had a few more than that as i'm sure people can figure out it's pretty straightforward mental arithmetic but it's um i i completely rounded it to a uh to a sort of punchy round number it's it's it's basically how much we can reasonably expect to get to to get to play with in terms it feels like a very small number when represented in which indeed even those who live to be a hundred it's the order of six thousand weeks it's not it's not it's not a lot right no there's something very interesting about weeks because if you express it in days well it's it's a very large number if you press it in years it's very small but we get the scent we have the feeling that a year lasts goes on forever so it doesn't really matter it's that it's that middle zone where you're expressing it in a relatively small number of a quantity that nonetheless we feel is very brief and irrelevant in the course of our lives it doesn't seem like if you waste a week of your life it ought to matter yeah that's very cool um so the book broadly uh speaks about um how do we choose what we choose so that's we can kind of touch upon some of those those subjects um you open by talking about um acknowledging and embracing the the limit embracing life and how time has perhaps had a different meaning to people over the ages perhaps you could talk about that um and how we think about time now yeah sure i mean i think par part of what i find myself doing in talking about this book is is sort of deflecting a potential interpretation of that title i mean i'm glad i've we gave this book an attention grabbing title but there's a misinterpretation i think which would be like okay this is time is incredibly short therefore the only way to make the most use of of it is to live in a kind of white knuckle um very self-conscious and and strenuous attempt to sort of eke the most out of every day and you know do extreme sports every weekend and uh and uh you know never never lose a second and i think that actually what i'm trying to get at here is that there's a huge amount of relief as well as energy and motivation and focus that comes from acknowledging how limited we are with respect to time and thus seeing all the different ways in which we can talk about this i'm sure you know especially in kind of productivity culture and time management but not only all the ways in which we we we proceed as if we might find a way to fit everything in we might find a way to become so efficient as to not have to encounter the the ramifications of being finite so it's really about a sort of dropping back down to the ground and uh making time for a handful of things that really matter and giving up this impossible struggle to sort of uh be infinite with respect to time as opposed to this kind of very exhausting and rather stressful kind of carpe diem approach which you do see in popular culture which i think ultimately is actually just another form of the of the attitude that i'm uh criticizing uh in the book to go even further into sort of unseating our conventional views of time yes you're right i think there's lots of good evidence that the example i hear in the book is english medieval peasants although i think it would also apply to many different cultures at different times in history perhaps also to some indigenous cultures today that this whole notion of time as something separate from you time is as a resource that you have to use well or that you could be guilty of wasting or that you need to sort of save through efficiency techniques the whole conceptual basis of that distinction uh i think we can confidently say just wouldn't have occurred to a kind of working class laborer in early medieval england right um time for for them and for many other people it would have followed the patterns that anthropologists call task orientation right so instead of thinking about your activities as lined up against a schedule or a timeline or a calendar or something it's the tasks themselves that would have given the rhythm to the day time would have just been the medium in which your life unfolded rather than something that you could sort of psychologically objectify and then be tormented by or try to dominate or feel hounded by and you know the productivity guru who had gone up to a medieval farmer and said like why don't you uh do all the milking for the month uh all in one day to get it out of the way because batching your tasks is a really great way to to get more things done i mean obviously that would have been lunacy and still today it's essentially you know lunacy as an approach to milking cows because those things just need doing when they need doing and crops need harvesting when they need harvesting and you know i think we all or many of us have some experience of this kind of time i think that one very obvious example is in the first few months with a newborn baby but i think that you don't have to be a parent to have been in places where that kind of sense of the schedule the sense of the timetable falls away and you're just sort of in time uh it has its disadvantages because you you can't build a sort of industrial technologically advanced society without without um that objectified idea of time but it has some big advantages as well which are a kind of peace of mind that i think is a lot harder for us to access uh today it was um you spoke about when you um time used to be measured in how long it takes to do a task so having to take instead of just using a minute or an hour you'd say all the time it takes to bring in the hair or milk the cat bring the hair milk out it actually made me think of i have a i have a five-year-old daughter and we measure time in the length of her favorite tv shows like how long would it take to get to this bus stop well at the time it takes to watch two of these shows so actually for children who don't understand minutes and hours we still use task based times i thought was quite interesting yeah no it's fascinating and even that kind of comparison like i don't think that would have been the normal way of talking my understanding of the literature is it wouldn't have been a normal way of talking about time it's just that when you had to do some comparing like there wasn't the widespread notion there wasn't the white there wasn't a sort of um widespread adoption of clocks or of time measuring devices among ordinary people so yeah you just have to grasp for some other for some other task as a as a comparator and you know people tend to think that life moved more slowly back then as another example of this but i think that probably that concept of life moving slowly would have been the thing that didn't make sense if you sort of time travel back to medieval england it's not that life moved more slowly but just like what slowly as compared to watch i mean it's just life it's just unfolding it's only a sort of post-industrialization that it is ubiquitous uh to think about life unfolding according to something that isn't life uh a time a timeline or a yardstick um you get it in ancient greece and rome like you get all sorts of things but it's that's a that's a new thing for for almost everybody in the world to be um thinking as a way of governing their lives and perhaps post internet we not only compare ourselves to how much we can family today but how much others are able or seem to be able to cram into a day and so the question of oh how do i do all of the things it's not just all of those those those big rocks that i want to accomplish but that others seem to be doing which i think uh perhaps you could talk about your dislike of the big rocks parable which for those i imagine that many those dudes but for those who don't know it's the it's it's how do you fit the big rocks the small box and the sand into a jar the idea being you have to put the big rocks in first and then the smaller things can fit around those but you dislike that for a very good reason well this is a metaphor for prioritization and it says you know if you want to have time to do everything that counts just make sure you make time first for the things that that really matter um yeah i mean i i think there is some wisdom in here but but the my basic objection is that this is a this is a rigged experiment the uh the person in the in the parable who is bringing these rocks and pebbles and sand into the classroom or seminar room or whether it's supposed to happen has only brought enough rocks uh that he knows in advance will will fit into the jar um and i don't think that our primary problem on the level of individual time management today is that we prioritize things badly although we do i think it is that there are too many big rocks there are too many things that genuinely matter and you know if we had 40 hours in a day we could still fill that time with things that genuinely matter it it isn't that if you find the right tricks and techniques you'll be able to get rid of only all the unimportant tedious stuff and then spend your life in this kind of unfolding of just pure meaningfulness and feel like you're doing everything it's like no you're gonna have to not do lots of things that do matter uh in order to make time for the things that you that you care about the most out of those out of those things let's talk about the efficiency traps so you talk about uh the the curse perhaps of clearing the decks we all come in and i've seen people block out the first hour of their calendars to clear emails you talk about how that actually creates more work right i mean this is something that i'm sure a number of people watching will be familiar with in in other contexts right this general idea which crops up as all sorts of other paradoxes the jevons paradox in in energy efficiency and a bunch of others but if you make a system more efficient without regard to any other governing value you just pursue greater efficiency in processing things through the system then all else being equal the system will fill with more and more stuff rather than bringing peace of mind and will or um or like empty time or capacity and it will um fill with with more and more junk rather than uh good stuff so applied to time management the idea here is you know if you get incredibly good at processing your email all else being equal what will happen is you'll just get more email uh because you'll reply to people and they'll reply to you and those replies will generate replies and they'll go forever you get a reputation for being responsive to email so more people will reach out to email you and just in general email unless it's stopped by some other act on your part email will just come to dominate your life more and more in direct contradiction to your motive initial motivation to uh to sort of bring email under control this is you know this is parkinson's law work expands to fill the time available for its completion um it's that thing where they widen motorways to relieve traffic congestion and it makes the uh it provides an added incentive for more drivers to use that route and so the the congestion sort of tends gradually back towards where it originally was so when i'm talking about the efficiency trap i'm talking about a thing which i think is encouraged by a lot of sort of less good productivity advice and productivity culture which is this idea that there is some inherent benefit in just getting more efficient at doing more things in a smaller amount of time firstly there's no benefit in doing things per se unless they're the good the right things to do and then secondly yeah you get into this problem where where um the more stuff that comes across your radar the the more likely you are to accept additional things to do that actually aren't worth your time because none of these incoming things will have to meet this um filter or me sort of get over this hurdle of is this worth sacrificing something else for because you've convinced yourself that you're gonna have time for for everything when i was working as a journalist on a sort of day-to-day as a feature writer at the guardian um yeah the the better i got at doing stuff the more more efficient i got at doing stuff the the more i began to realize what i was really good at was doing stuff that didn't matter and that the things that i really cared about would just get endlessly postponed while i told myself yeah i was clearing the decks which was your original question and we could talk more about that but anyway i'll stop there for now no that's really cool um and i certainly know when when i clear the decks i actually get a little um like an endorphin rush for having done something like that the element of completeness but um and i don't want to perhaps address the more difficult task um but let's talk about um you talk about finitude and pronounce that correctly uh which which i've sort of summarized is acknowledging our mortality which sounds very a bit bleak but actually when you when you accept that and think about it it can be liberating perhaps you could talk about that concept you've you've coined i mean i didn't invent the word finitude people have people do wonder about how to pronounce it all i can say is in the audiobook for this i say finitude a lot so i really i really hope that's the right uh the right pronunciation i i just mean yes i this is a consequence of the fact that we die but i don't think that this book is really about you know it's not really about death and dying and mortality and that kind of very melodramatic kind of and very difficult uh aspect of human existence it's not about suggesting that anyone can sort of completely confront their mortality i don't think i certainly don't think i have um but rather the fact that our time is limited and that we are sort of material creatures in limited time with limited energy and limited attentional bandwidth and and all the rest of it the consequence of this i'm sort of wrapping up in this word finitude to refer to the state of being limited and therefore having to make by definition you know trade-offs and to exist in a world of opportunity costs and having to make tough decisions not being able to do all the things that we are you know psychologically able to think about and imagine not being able to meet all the demands that society might throw at us there's just no reason to assume that if we can think of something or somebody can ask something of us uh that there's capacity for it in a in a human in a human life uh uh beyond a certain point there won't be and uh these kind of sacrifices will just be be built into the situation so i think what i'm saying for a big chunk of the book is that like this is such an uncomfortable feeling that we pursue all sorts of uh ultimately counterproductive activities to sort of engage in emotional avoidance to feel like we're limitless when we're not i think that a lot of uh distraction is is based on is rooted in that we could talk about that if you like and i think a lot of time management stuff and certainly the years i spent as a sort of weirdo productivity geek um still am a little bit but you know recovering maybe they were it was about trying to achieve a kind of control over my time and my projects and my work in my life that would you know that subliminally would enable you not to have me not to have to confront this i think situation yeah you do you define distraction is motivated by the desire to try to flee something painful about our experience with the present which i quite which i quite liked and um we think about um well perhaps we could talk about the attention economy and how that feeds kind of our desire to be distracted and sort of be feel like we're achieving something whereas actually we're not achieving anything sure i mean i i don't know the individual details of people watching this but i don't feel that any of you are likely to need a sort of basic introduction to the idea of of the attention economy what i'm what i'm trying to explore in the book is well two points really firstly how the firstly that attention is so fundamental to the experience of life that calling it a resource like a limited resource people talk about it is almost uh a misnomer you know it's it there's a sense in which attention just is life and and what you pay attention to over the course of your life will sum up to what your life will have been so it's an incredibly uh serious thing to be involved with either as a user of technology or as or as someone working in uh digital technology but also secondly this thing that i don't think gets us enough attention which is you know i have many many criticisms of social media platforms and algorithmically driven you know attention mining effectively but but we talk a lot as if this is a sort of force that we i mean if you if you read a lot of stuff or you watch you know the social dilemma et cetera you you might be left with the impression that the the typical moment of digital distraction is one in which you know i'm sort of working away on a piece of writing and i'm feeling thrilled by it and it's so wonderful and i'm really enjoying myself and then um like somehow the the evil tendrils of silicon valley come and sort of grab me unwillingly away from my from my work and i do think that some of the tendrils of silicon valley are evil and that we should talk critically about them but that's not what happens what happens is i'm finding the work unpleasant or intimidating or boring or difficult and i am thrilled by the opportunity to go and scroll through down my phone for a bit instead and do something to leave or to leave aside something that i thought was what really mattered to me and go and do something that by definition if it's distraction like doesn't matter to me yeah and so i'm looking in the book at the idea that basically what's going on here is that that um you know it's not a coincidence that things that matter to us induce discomfort um they bring us up against the limits of our capacities and our ability to control how time unfolds you're writing a chapter of your novel you don't know that it's going to go well you don't know you've got what it takes you don't know that people will receive it well it might be forgotten or ignored or mocked you want to have an important difficult conversation with your spouse you don't know how it's going to unfold it might leave you feeling emotionally emotionally vulnerable it might lead to an angry exchange you know you can't you don't have that control it's precisely because these things matter that they evoke these uncomfortable feelings and then i think it feels absolutely wonderful to do something uh less important instead and to sort of zone out and i think the phenomenology of the internet is a super interesting part of this because actually these days we've always been distractible for these reasons but these days not only samuel johnson wrote about it but not only do we have reason to flee the stuff we care about because of discomfort but we have a place to go when we're fleeing it that phenomenologically speaking does feel kind of limitless it does feel like um a a realm where limits don't apply where you can portray yourself how you like find out about things that are happening thousands and thousands of miles away in virtually no time at all um it's very seductive as a as a as a way not to confront the the sort of limitations of being a human creature in time but i do think that ultimately it's only by confronting some of those limitations that we that we make progress on the things that we that we care about so it's uh getting finding some way to tolerate or accommodate or get friendly with that discomfort i think is a pretty much a superpower when it comes to thriving in the modern world no no i certainly struggle that i know every time i delete myself on purpose forget my password for social media i get distracted by the news or putting on the radio or something something else um well the second half of your book uh really speaks about the concept of time and how we how we define it and how we think about it i thought i might just read a small section which really spoke to me at the beginning of chapter eight sure um there's another sense in which treating time is something that we own and get to control seems to make life worse inevitably we become obsessed with using it well whereupon we discover an unfortunate truth the more you focus on using time well the more each day begins to feel like something you have to get through on route to some karma better more fulfilling point in the future which never actually arrives this this future chasing or i think you call it like the when i finally view of ourselves i mean is it is that just part of the human condition is that something we can we can acknowledge i know i know i'm always sort of doing something to get to the next stage um how do you how how have you thought about that and how we can for one of a better phrase live more in the moment yeah such a big question we can come to that because i i have thoughts about that but um yeah i think that um i i don't i think that an instrumental approach to experience right to using to to doing things now for some future gain is absolutely sort of you know as old as humanity nothing would ever get done if people couldn't sort of persevere to to do things and building civilization would never have would never have happened i think then once we all enter into this very instrumentalized notion of time that we were talking about at the beginning where we're all trying to use not only up the resources around us but we're thinking of time as a resource to use well then again it becomes something we have to do i wouldn't have written this book if i wasn't willing to instrumentalize time in a certain in a certain sense and nobody would ever get anything done in their in their professional lives if they didn't so i'm really talking about a kind of over investment in that stance a sense that i think is driven especially by the economic system that we live in and the stage that that's at now excuse me where it becomes the only form of value it all too easily that sort of instrumental mindset just sort of forces everything else out so so in other words you come to think about every moment of time only or pretty much only in terms of its value for some future moment of time and that when it's taken to that absolute place that that clearly is self-defeating and an irrational and and unfortunate uh way to be because it's um you know by definition you're going to you're placing the val the whole value of life constantly uh at some point that is not now and it only ever is now so you're never going to kind of cash out the value of life and find value in the moment so i think it's about sort of having the ability to take both of those perspectives it's certainly i don't recommend and i certainly have never retained myself the ability to care only about this precise moment um and not where it's leading but i think that you know over investment in that we see the effects of that all around us in sort of sapping the meaning from people's lives like what is this all for because they're aware on some level that what it's all for when they get to the time when it's supposedly all four it'll all still be for something in the future from then as well and and so on it felt like trying to find the fun in the moment and perhaps we you think about childhood where you know nursery leads to reception reception leads to this year and you know you're then working towards university and university more than job is for retirement and at which point is yeah at what point are you sort of having fun in the in the moment right right um perhaps you could um you talk about you know within within our con how we work with time and what we think about it um rediscovering rest and hobbies for the sake of it and perhaps you know when we think about having more fun do do we do enough things enough activities which we only do for their own sake you just moved to yorkshire where you probably have more opportunities to go for a walk in the in the in the countryside yeah i'm really i'm having a walk yeah i'm really putting my claims to the test here because i've got no excuse left anymore not to spend a significant chunk of my time hiking on the north york moors and uh so if i don't then i really am condemned uh as a as a failure of uh embracing the moment so we shall see i've been here two weeks i've been on a couple of hikes um i'll report back later um i think that um you know this instrumental this exclusive focus on the instrumental use of time uh is sort of at its most ironic in the context of leisure because like it's if you're even treating your leisure as a means to an end solely as a means to an end then like what what's left the the certainly the sort of ancient greek speaking broadly conception of leisure was that it was the the goal of everything else so you maybe had to work um and you maybe had to do all sorts of things but but but the reason you were doing them all was so that you could get the time the leisure time that was that was sort of life uh in its highest expression which admittedly for ancient philosophers tends to mean what you should do with that time is like philosophy they were that was a so that's not this doesn't necessarily follow but so i'm sort of making the case in the book for something that the the contemporary philosopher kieran satya has described as atylic activities things that you do not because of what they're leading up to or amounting to that are not defined by some kind of end point hiking is a fun example um just because um you know anyone who has any experience of enjoying a walk in the country knows you you probably drive the car to a car park somewhere and then you either go in a loop back to the car or you walk you know a few miles to a to an extreme point and turn around and come back if you wanted to do either of those things most efficiently the simplest way would just be not to go on the hike in the first place um all you're doing is getting getting back to where you started now there are instrumental benefits you know there are you can it's a it's good for your physical fitness uh you um might be like recording your route on all these social um apps for for you know now that enable you to share your um the views that you're gazing out over but basically you hike to hike and as cetera says you know there's not going to become a you're not going to get to a point in your life where you think um okay i've done all the hiking i'd aim to do that job is complete you are going to stop but you're not going to stop because you've reached the end of a project or exhausted an activity you're just going to stop because eventually you will or your interest might change or you may be too old and frail to continue or any number of things and that kind of i think that's i think that's what the the i think that's what is crystallized in the idea of a hobby and i think it's probably why the idea of a hobby feels a little bit cringe and embarrassing in the modern world right unlike as i say but unlike side hustles which are hobbies that have a very clear instrumental value that you're going to make money out of them and they are they are cool and hip and and it's good to have a side hustle it's kind of embarrassing to have a hobby and i think that that is at least in part because they don't fit and they are sort of culturally subversive in a way uh they don't they don't fit into this idea that everything has got to be for something else and quite possibly that something else is is financial profit but not necessarily it's just it's all for something other than itself and that's not true of uh you know of going on a hike um yeah so yeah that's that's that's very cool um i've written on my notes here um painting staring which uh i've not i've not yet had the time to go and find three hours to do this but perhaps you could talk about i've i've i haven't got the the name of the lady who suggested doing it but perhaps you could talk about that and what you found in in taking three hours out of the data stairs painting yeah totally i mean this is this is the part of the book where i'm writing about patience and impatience and i think that um one way to understand the feeling of impatience that is that is uh you know as ubiquitous today as ever it's another example of the way we rail against our limitation right and in that case it's the limitation of how fast we can force the rest of the world to to go um [Music] and this idea that certain activities just take the time they take and and sort of dictate their own speed and we just have to if we want to get the benefit of them we just have to fit around that instead of trying to constantly uh accelerate them up to the level where we would feel like we were the ones in control of them there's a art historian at harvard called uh jennifer roberts who um asks all her incoming students to do this exercise where they have to select a painting or a sculpture in the cambridge boston area and go and look at it for three hours straight um [Music] i think they're allowed to take bathroom breaks but that's it right it's just you just you you you sit there stand there i think you know folding chairs are useful here and um i looked at three hours and the point is you know she knows that's a crazily long amount of time but she knows that how people react to that her insight is that um it's very easy to think that you've seen a painting just because you've looked at it for a couple of seconds uh and that the tempo of life that her students are exposed to today through technology through the hyper-competitive atmosphere at universities like harvard and all the rest of it is such that like she needs to play a role as a teacher in deliberately making the tempo be much much much much slower to sort of make them go through the discomfort of staying in that one place to the point where you you can then see things you know i mean you really do see things in a painting if you look for that sort of absurdly long amount of time and i went to do this i went to meet her harvard and i sat at in the harvard art museums and did a and looked at a painting by uh dagar uh for three hours taking notes that's loud um and you know i spent the first half hour thinking i'd totally chosen the wrong painting i should have chosen something with more to look at which was just a manifestation of the impatience right and you go through then another hour of sort of all kinds of fidgety awful discomfort but on the other side of that you i genuinely did literally see things in this painting uh that i hadn't seen until then uh i'm not i'm not using c metaphorically to mean like i had thoughts about what it could mean i literally saw shadows and facial expressions and lines that seemed to suggest areas of space that i hadn't previously seen it's extraordinary and um it's just a sort of slightly extreme example of the benefit of letting something that you're engaged with take its time i think a more day-to-day example uh stop me if you want to be on something else but more day-to-day example of this is just like reading especially kind of reading fiction people me particularly right people say these days that they don't they can't find time to read that's a very common complaint and i think it's true to some extent but mainly i don't think people mean that they don't have a half hour in a 24-hour period when they could read a book some people are that busy but i think a lot of us are not it's that when we find that half hour and sit down with say a novel we don't we're too sort of um amped up and to running too fast to to slow down to the speed that reading a novel or reading a lot of non-fiction books too um requires so your sort of the flywheel is turning so fast that it feels really unpleasant to to slow it down so naturally you know people want to read summaries and synopsis or find techniques of speed reading to to bring reading up to the speed of of the the rest of life um and i think those do have some benefits for just sort of sheer information absorption but the real experience of reading a good book is just one that like there's a little amount of acceleration you can you can bring to it but beyond that it's just it just takes the time it takes it's given by the book the speed right it's not given by you you don't get to um dictate how fast it goes i guess just finally on this topic i always think it's so fascinating how as technology has made has caused it to take much much much less time to to do things that previously took a long time uh we actually get more and more impatient rather than less impatient yeah why is it so much more frustrating to wait eight seconds for a really badly slow loading web page than like three days to be sent some information in the mail it's like it shouldn't be that way we should be like feeling so relaxed and expansive about how much time we have and the idea i explore in the book is that part of what's going on here is just that we have now thanks to uh technological developments got to the point where it really does feel like we are almost able to do everything we want instantaneously almost able to cook our food in zero seconds flat because it only takes two minutes in the microwave almost able to find any information that we want uh you know with without any perceptible time delay and so in that situation of feeling like you are very nearly uh god it's way more frustrating to run up against the remaining ways in which you aren't you know the the fact that novels still take time to consume the fact that there are some slow loading web pages the fact that it does take two whole minutes uh to heat some food in the microwave instead of zero um if you work in an office with a microwave it's always been cancelled out at like seven seconds because i'm sure people tell themselves because their food was ready but actually i think it's because they're just like they couldn't wait they couldn't bear it anymore and that's the moment at which they were like ah screw this i'm just gonna take the food out because i cannot bring myself to wait these seconds it's really you know i i this is totally anecdotal but i think that people get um more impatient and angrier in in traffic in road traffic now that so much of our life is lived on smartphones operating at broadband speeds because i feel like it the contrast between uh so much of what we can do and the material obstacles of the cars in front just gets more and more pronounced and enraging i wondered if the pandemic had in any way exasperated that because we now do even more online when we're used to food being delivered as and when we want it that when we interact with the physical world yeah those frustrations i don't know a year of living inside i think has to an extent made us even more unaccepting of the slowness of the real world um could be yeah i don't know that and i think there are also advanced i think there are also things we see afresh and appreciate and value about the concrete material world as a result of the time you know the time in the pandemic but yeah it's certainly plausible definitely yeah uh if you have any questions uh whilst watching please add them in the in the chat window um we'll get to those after i've spoken uh asked you about well let's say that we have um embraced our finitude and we've decided which big rocks we want to put into our jar what are some tips that you would give us to start embracing this lifestyle what can we what can we actively do now to kind of to to be better at this it's a really good question yeah you should end the book you speak about yes it's a really good question i am a little bit conflicted about answering it because i do think that ultimately this is about a shift in perspective it is about seeing things differently i don't mean that i expect people to sort of read my book and have a sort of instant spiritual enlightenment experience i it can be a small perspective shift i think it is a so i think it is mainly about sort of feeling your way into this limit embracing mindset and what you find then sometimes is that it's really obvious what techniques or methods you should use to implement that or take one thing i've found for example is that you know productivity techniques i experimented with years ago but did so then in the spirit of trying to become the perfect controller of my time they're perfectly useful ways to organize the day now but i'm holding them much more loosely as a result of having felt my way somewhat into this this different mindset that said i definitely think there are some approaches to organizing work and life for example that that make more sense and that go with this mindset more than more than others one whole set of them is any kind of technique or approach to work that focuses on sort of serializing on sequent or making big projects sequential on getting closer to that state of doing one thing at a time whether that's literally on the level of the individual task or on the level of major projects sort of making most of them cue and line up behind one that you're focusing on now and moving it through and finishing it so the kanban approach to workflow management that i'm sure many people be familiar with uh there's a there's a great book called personal kanban by um jim benson and tony anne barry about applying this uh kind of that kind of approach which is obviously a team approach to your individual workflow there are lots of other ways i give a very simple one in the book about well let me stop and pause the point is all these things having progress all these things have in common is that they limit your work in progress they say okay here are the 40 things that feel like they matter and here are the three or so that i'm going to give my attention to and i'm not going to move on to the others until at least one of those three is is completed so you sort of bring yourself to live with the anxiety of knowing that all these other things are going uncompleted in order to bring something uh to completion and then just quickly you know i think i think all sort of time boxing and time blocking approaches can be well adapted to this to this mindset if you say i'm going to try to ring fence two or three hours of the morning for um sort of focused work that really matters to me and i'm going to try to limit my email processing time to an hour and a half towards the end of the day in both those cases what you're saying is you're not saying i'm going to finish this project today or i'm going to get to the bottom of my email today you're going time first you're saying i'm going to dedicate this amount of time to it i'm going to stop at the end of that time that's kind of a way of thinking about your schedule that really respects the finitude of your time instead of one that goes tasks first and says i've got to get through this whole list come what may and then you find you know that you're still at your desk at 11 p.m and the list just got twice as long during the course of day anyway i think you've actually if we can bring up julie julie's question i think you've actually kind of answered this uh so based on oliver's thoughts on the negativity of distraction i'm curious to hear his take on multitasking and how we can do it in a more time efficient manner i feel like you're saying don't do multitasking yeah i mean it's a little there's a there's some there are some subtleties here there are there's research that show you know certain forms of multitasking with using different kinds of attentional channels and stuff can be that can work i don't tell people they shouldn't listen to a podcast while they're doing the vacuuming or something you can you can combine tasks meaningfully in that way when it comes to our sort of focused focused attention on on sort of mentally taxing tasks um you basically just can't multitask anyway and if you think that you are doing what you're really doing is rapidly switching between things between keeping half an eye on your email inbox and a piece of writing you're trying to do say and calling it multitasking and i think that generally what happens there i think there are personality differences i don't want to tell people they definitely should never do it but generally what happens there if you have um you know three or four or five potential destinations for your attention at any moment is that as soon as any one of them gets difficult or challenging you just bounce off to one that's a bit easier and i think this probably especially happens more on the level of projects as opposed to tasks in other words to some degree manage your moment-to-moment tasks how you like but if you are really telling yourself that say in my case it could be three articles that i really care about if i'm really telling myself that all of those three are going to be kind of moved forward roughly at the same time or during the same period of time all that happens is that the moment one of them becomes difficult because guess what meaningful and important things feel difficult and uncomfortable you just move to the other one so you add you end up managing to make no progress on them because you're just sort of escaping the difficulty at each point so um you know it's not that you can't ever combine tasks or don't ever need to keep an eye on some on your email while doing something else but that like if you see what's going on there and you become more conscious of it you're much more likely to be able to avoid this situation of like not really doing anything because what you're actually doing in those contexts is pursuing the emotional feeling of being in control taking care of business having fingers in pies uh at the expense of getting things done that that you care about brilliant look let's take peter's question is this the midlife crisis book like this do you need to have changed extreme do you need to have chased extreme productivity first and having achieved common life goals family career financial to begin seeking a new perspective on time it's such a good question there's two interpretations of it right is it is this did this book emerge from my having a midlife crisis probably in some sense and then is it only useful for people who are at that stage and i i tried very consciously in in writing this book to not make it a book that was only uh beneficial to people who'd sort of exhausted all those techniques or perhaps what i mean is to point out certain truths about how those techniques work that might um that might accelerate uh a sort of profitable kind of crisis in someone who is uh you know uh in their 30s or their late 20s rather than in their 40s like me um i think there's some truth to this right i think that that that one of the easiest ways to uh understand the limitations of this kind of uh limit denying approach to life is to pursue it very energetically for a number of years and exhaust it and and realize that a different method is is required and i also think that many of the sort of things that people achieve in the first half of adulthood um which is often things like you know establishing themselves in a career separating off from their family of origin and being part of a of their own family um you know these things are can be done with and perhaps even sometimes catalyzed by a sort of unrealistic belief in the degree of your control over your life i guess i i guess i just end up by saying that i don't think it is ever um unhelpful to to see how reality is when it comes to time when it comes to our limitations i don't think it's something that you can only understand at a certain point in life and i don't think it's something that um that it's beneficial to sort of have kept from it to have kept from you as an earlier stage of life you know i'll be honest i think it would be i would be surprised if there were sort of 16 17 year olds who who thought that this book spoke to them i would be very gratified but i think it probably is something that comes from i also think that the age at which people encounter the sort of impossible demands of the world that we've created is clearly getting lower right the age of which people say the wage in which people complain about burnout i mean this is that burnout is a thing that people encounter in their 20s now judging by all sorts of reports and books and studies um not something that you have to have got into your sort of mid 50s uh before you've before you're sort of exhausted enough to encounter it so i think that hopefully the relevance of this the age at which this book is relevant to people is is falling as the uh as the world gets uh more and more insane with respect to timing the pace of acceleration is accelerating is healthy let's take mario's tour mario's question uh thanks to the talk my question is about attention span uh is there any reliable evidence on shortened attention spans as patients in the modern world uh is it real or is it a myth did you do any research on on this attention span is a really weird concept it's a very good question attention span is a really weird concept that i um have tried to understand and don't write about in the book because it just seems extremely uh it it sort of falls apart on on closer in inspection patience i think there's good reason to believe um that um that we sort of tolerate shorter and shorter amounts of time that it takes to do things or to have information communicated to us there's all sorts of fascinating longitudinal research on like the the length of edits in movies and the length of political speeches and uh sort of things like that that at least seem to be responding to a desire for um shorter and shorter bits of focus um i think that yeah i don't i i don't think that it's the most useful way to think about what's happening to our attention to think about that we are um less and less able to focus for extended periods of time i think it is probably more helpful and certainly more clearly true anyway that we are more and more tempted to abandon those focused periods of time and that there are more and more services and devices only too willing to you know use cutting-edge technology to keep us distracted once we have left those uh those that that focus for for distraction so it's in a way you're talking about attention span there but in a way you're talking about the sense that there are other possibilities and if you find yourself in a hut on a mountainside with no internet access and nothing to do but write your novel you're more likely to write your novel not because you've suddenly developed a long attention span but because um alternatives have been taken away from you the the sort of tormenting choice of other options is gone for a while yeah i find when i really need to get something done i will leave my phone and laptop home and take a notepad and a pen to a coffee shop and that's that i can't do anything else except yeah get through that yeah uh i'd love to know um how are you thinking about teaching this to your you have a son how are you thinking about teaching this how can we how can we what should we be teaching our children about this this concept such an interesting question and i don't feel like he's four turning five so i still really don't feel like i know what i'm doing when it comes to parenting and also he keeps getting older and changing so what anything i do learn becomes out of date um i you know i have been sort of fascinated and slightly dismayed just they obviously everyone says it's about kids right they reflect your your own personality back to you in ways that are often uncomfortable you know that when he started to sort of ask what we were doing next what we're doing next and trying to like get a schedule for the day into his head i was like oh my god i've really totally inculcated productivity geekhood uh into him and i'm hoping that uh you know i i think i see that being out here in uh more spending more time in nature is is something that sort of seeps into his uh bones i tell you what i think is the the most sort of uh daunting lesson that i have learned about inculcating lessons i guess is that uh you really have to do it yourself if you want the kid to do it too in other words you if you want to be if you want your child to grow up to be someone who isn't checking their phone every three seconds you have to not check your phone every three seconds and even more weirdly i think it's true that you have to not be i mean he doesn't have a phone but you know what i mean he's already he you know he's he's very interested by screens that are in the house and that's fine but i don't want him to be completely fixated by them not only do you have to be better at yourself in their presence but you sort of have to genuinely live it in your whole life even when they're in bed it's a really strange kind of uh almost kind of uh paranormal phenomenon or something right that like um you can't just uh put them to bed and then for two hours become a completely scattered uh terrible user of time or or something like that if you really want to model those lessons so that's what i'm sort of grappling with i don't want to make it sound entirely to do with screens that's just sort of everyone's always worrying about that so much but like to be present in the moment like i feel like the very best thing i can do is to be better at that and do you think do you think writing the book as a self-confessed um time management do you think writing the book has helped you become better at you know yeah no definitely i think lots of people sometimes assume the way books get written is you sort of have a great insight and then you set it down in in writing but for me the experience of the writing this book was that i did sort of have to as i discovered what i thought about time through writing it i did have to sort of become more of that become more of that person uh partly it's just accountability right i mean if i'm going to give some talk somewhere and someone spots me like impatiently freaking out about how like long the microwave is taking then i'm kind of it's pretty embarrassing but but more generally and more authentically you know it's just like no i i understand intellectually a huge number of things to be true now about time that i previously didn't and then the long haul is kind of living into those uh intellectual realizations and i've and i've done it somewhat and i've got a long way to go wonderful well oliver thank you so much for joining us today it's been it's been genuinely insightful i can't recommend the book enough available in audio you said you've done the audio book as well so yes that's available uh i have not done one of these talks and and put as many post-it notes inside it um as ever uh so yeah genuinely recommend uh is a great read for everyone a good use of one of your four thousand weeks i think was a quote i've stolen from another review online um thank you so on behalf of everyone watching now and in the future thank you so much for joining us hopefully one day for your next book you can join us in the office i will be delightful um otherwise oliver thank you so much for joining us today thank you it's been a pleasure i really enjoyed it and great questions thank you thank you [Music]

by oliver berkman author of 4 000 weeks time and how to use it uh oliver is the author of the antidote happiness for people who can't stand positive thinking and for many years wrote a popular weekly column on psychology for the guardian this column will change your life here's a devoted following for his writing on productivity mortality the power of limits and be building a meaningful life in an age of bewilderment uh please join me in thanking oliver for joining us today oliver hi thanks very much for inviting me this is great thank you so much for coming uh well look i am genuinely excited about talking to you uh three four four thousand weeks uh i i i've so many questions so many thoughts about it perhaps you could start by telling us what does four thousand weeks represent why why the why the title of the book so four thousand weeks is extremely approximately the average human lifespan in the west expressed in terms of weeks if you live to be 80 you'll have had a few more than that as i'm sure people can figure out it's pretty straightforward mental arithmetic but it's um i i completely rounded it to a uh to a sort of punchy round number it's it's it's basically how much we can reasonably expect to get to to get to play with in terms it feels like a very small number when represented in which indeed even those who live to be a hundred it's the order of six thousand weeks it's not it's not it's not a lot right no there's something very interesting about weeks because if you express it in days well it's it's a very large number if you press it in years it's very small but we get the scent we have the feeling that a year lasts goes on forever so it doesn't really matter it's that it's that middle zone where you're expressing it in a relatively small number of a quantity that nonetheless we feel is very brief and irrelevant in the course of our lives it doesn't seem like if you waste a week of your life it ought to matter yeah that's very cool um so the book broadly uh speaks about um how do we choose what we choose so that's we can kind of touch upon some of those those subjects um you open by talking about um acknowledging and embracing the the limit embracing life and how time has perhaps had a different meaning to people over the ages perhaps you could talk about that um and how we think about time now yeah sure i mean i think par part of what i find myself doing in talking about this book is is sort of deflecting a potential interpretation of that title i mean i'm glad i've we gave this book an attention grabbing title but there's a misinterpretation i think which would be like okay this is time is incredibly short therefore the only way to make the most use of of it is to live in a kind of white knuckle um very self-conscious and and strenuous attempt to sort of eke the most out of every day and you know do extreme sports every weekend and uh and uh you know never never lose a second and i think that actually what i'm trying to get at here is that there's a huge amount of relief as well as energy and motivation and focus that comes from acknowledging how limited we are with respect to time and thus seeing all the different ways in which we can talk about this i'm sure you know especially in kind of productivity culture and time management but not only all the ways in which we we we proceed as if we might find a way to fit everything in we might find a way to become so efficient as to not have to encounter the the ramifications of being finite so it's really about a sort of dropping back down to the ground and uh making time for a handful of things that really matter and giving up this impossible struggle to sort of uh be infinite with respect to time as opposed to this kind of very exhausting and rather stressful kind of carpe diem approach which you do see in popular culture which i think ultimately is actually just another form of the of the attitude that i'm uh criticizing uh in the book to go even further into sort of unseating our conventional views of time yes you're right i think there's lots of good evidence that the example i hear in the book is english medieval peasants although i think it would also apply to many different cultures at different times in history perhaps also to some indigenous cultures today that this whole notion of time as something separate from you time is as a resource that you have to use well or that you could be guilty of wasting or that you need to sort of save through efficiency techniques the whole conceptual basis of that distinction uh i think we can confidently say just wouldn't have occurred to a kind of working class laborer in early medieval england right um time for for them and for many other people it would have followed the patterns that anthropologists call task orientation right so instead of thinking about your activities as lined up against a schedule or a timeline or a calendar or something it's the tasks themselves that would have given the rhythm to the day time would have just been the medium in which your life unfolded rather than something that you could sort of psychologically objectify and then be tormented by or try to dominate or feel hounded by and you know the productivity guru who had gone up to a medieval farmer and said like why don't you uh do all the milking for the month uh all in one day to get it out of the way because batching your tasks is a really great way to to get more things done i mean obviously that would have been lunacy and still today it's essentially you know lunacy as an approach to milking cows because those things just need doing when they need doing and crops need harvesting when they need harvesting and you know i think we all or many of us have some experience of this kind of time i think that one very obvious example is in the first few months with a newborn baby but i think that you don't have to be a parent to have been in places where that kind of sense of the schedule the sense of the timetable falls away and you're just sort of in time uh it has its disadvantages because you you can't build a sort of industrial technologically advanced society without without um that objectified idea of time but it has some big advantages as well which are a kind of peace of mind that i think is a lot harder for us to access uh today it was um you spoke about when you um time used to be measured in how long it takes to do a task so having to take instead of just using a minute or an hour you'd say all the time it takes to bring in the hair or milk the cat bring the hair milk out it actually made me think of i have a i have a five-year-old daughter and we measure time in the length of her favorite tv shows like how long would it take to get to this bus stop well at the time it takes to watch two of these shows so actually for children who don't understand minutes and hours we still use task based times i thought was quite interesting yeah no it's fascinating and even that kind of comparison like i don't think that would have been the normal way of talking my understanding of the literature is it wouldn't have been a normal way of talking about time it's just that when you had to do some comparing like there wasn't the widespread notion there wasn't the white there wasn't a sort of um widespread adoption of clocks or of time measuring devices among ordinary people so yeah you just have to grasp for some other for some other task as a as a comparator and you know people tend to think that life moved more slowly back then as another example of this but i think that probably that concept of life moving slowly would have been the thing that didn't make sense if you sort of time travel back to medieval england it's not that life moved more slowly but just like what slowly as compared to watch i mean it's just life it's just unfolding it's only a sort of post-industrialization that it is ubiquitous uh to think about life unfolding according to something that isn't life uh a time a timeline or a yardstick um you get it in ancient greece and rome like you get all sorts of things but it's that's a that's a new thing for for almost everybody in the world to be um thinking as a way of governing their lives and perhaps post internet we not only compare ourselves to how much we can family today but how much others are able or seem to be able to cram into a day and so the question of oh how do i do all of the things it's not just all of those those those big rocks that i want to accomplish but that others seem to be doing which i think uh perhaps you could talk about your dislike of the big rocks parable which for those i imagine that many those dudes but for those who don't know it's the it's it's how do you fit the big rocks the small box and the sand into a jar the idea being you have to put the big rocks in first and then the smaller things can fit around those but you dislike that for a very good reason well this is a metaphor for prioritization and it says you know if you want to have time to do everything that counts just make sure you make time first for the things that that really matter um yeah i mean i i think there is some wisdom in here but but the my basic objection is that this is a this is a rigged experiment the uh the person in the in the parable who is bringing these rocks and pebbles and sand into the classroom or seminar room or whether it's supposed to happen has only brought enough rocks uh that he knows in advance will will fit into the jar um and i don't think that our primary problem on the level of individual time management today is that we prioritize things badly although we do i think it is that there are too many big rocks there are too many things that genuinely matter and you know if we had 40 hours in a day we could still fill that time with things that genuinely matter it it isn't that if you find the right tricks and techniques you'll be able to get rid of only all the unimportant tedious stuff and then spend your life in this kind of unfolding of just pure meaningfulness and feel like you're doing everything it's like no you're gonna have to not do lots of things that do matter uh in order to make time for the things that you that you care about the most out of those out of those things let's talk about the efficiency traps so you talk about uh the the curse perhaps of clearing the decks we all come in and i've seen people block out the first hour of their calendars to clear emails you talk about how that actually creates more work right i mean this is something that i'm sure a number of people watching will be familiar with in in other contexts right this general idea which crops up as all sorts of other paradoxes the jevons paradox in in energy efficiency and a bunch of others but if you make a system more efficient without regard to any other governing value you just pursue greater efficiency in processing things through the system then all else being equal the system will fill with more and more stuff rather than bringing peace of mind and will or um or like empty time or capacity and it will um fill with with more and more junk rather than uh good stuff so applied to time management the idea here is you know if you get incredibly good at processing your email all else being equal what will happen is you'll just get more email uh because you'll reply to people and they'll reply to you and those replies will generate replies and they'll go forever you get a reputation for being responsive to email so more people will reach out to email you and just in general email unless it's stopped by some other act on your part email will just come to dominate your life more and more in direct contradiction to your motive initial motivation to uh to sort of bring email under control this is you know this is parkinson's law work expands to fill the time available for its completion um it's that thing where they widen motorways to relieve traffic congestion and it makes the uh it provides an added incentive for more drivers to use that route and so the the congestion sort of tends gradually back towards where it originally was so when i'm talking about the efficiency trap i'm talking about a thing which i think is encouraged by a lot of sort of less good productivity advice and productivity culture which is this idea that there is some inherent benefit in just getting more efficient at doing more things in a smaller amount of time firstly there's no benefit in doing things per se unless they're the good the right things to do and then secondly yeah you get into this problem where where um the more stuff that comes across your radar the the more likely you are to accept additional things to do that actually aren't worth your time because none of these incoming things will have to meet this um filter or me sort of get over this hurdle of is this worth sacrificing something else for because you've convinced yourself that you're gonna have time for for everything when i was working as a journalist on a sort of day-to-day as a feature writer at the guardian um yeah the the better i got at doing stuff the more more efficient i got at doing stuff the the more i began to realize what i was really good at was doing stuff that didn't matter and that the things that i really cared about would just get endlessly postponed while i told myself yeah i was clearing the decks which was your original question and we could talk more about that but anyway i'll stop there for now no that's really cool um and i certainly know when when i clear the decks i actually get a little um like an endorphin rush for having done something like that the element of completeness but um and i don't want to perhaps address the more difficult task um but let's talk about um you talk about finitude and pronounce that correctly uh which which i've sort of summarized is acknowledging our mortality which sounds very a bit bleak but actually when you when you accept that and think about it it can be liberating perhaps you could talk about that concept you've you've coined i mean i didn't invent the word finitude people have people do wonder about how to pronounce it all i can say is in the audiobook for this i say finitude a lot so i really i really hope that's the right uh the right pronunciation i i just mean yes i this is a consequence of the fact that we die but i don't think that this book is really about you know it's not really about death and dying and mortality and that kind of very melodramatic kind of and very difficult uh aspect of human existence it's not about suggesting that anyone can sort of completely confront their mortality i don't think i certainly don't think i have um but rather the fact that our time is limited and that we are sort of material creatures in limited time with limited energy and limited attentional bandwidth and and all the rest of it the consequence of this i'm sort of wrapping up in this word finitude to refer to the state of being limited and therefore having to make by definition you know trade-offs and to exist in a world of opportunity costs and having to make tough decisions not being able to do all the things that we are you know psychologically able to think about and imagine not being able to meet all the demands that society might throw at us there's just no reason to assume that if we can think of something or somebody can ask something of us uh that there's capacity for it in a in a human in a human life uh uh beyond a certain point there won't be and uh these kind of sacrifices will just be be built into the situation so i think what i'm saying for a big chunk of the book is that like this is such an uncomfortable feeling that we pursue all sorts of uh ultimately counterproductive activities to sort of engage in emotional avoidance to feel like we're limitless when we're not i think that a lot of uh distraction is is based on is rooted in that we could talk about that if you like and i think a lot of time management stuff and certainly the years i spent as a sort of weirdo productivity geek um still am a little bit but you know recovering maybe they were it was about trying to achieve a kind of control over my time and my projects and my work in my life that would you know that subliminally would enable you not to have me not to have to confront this i think situation yeah you do you define distraction is motivated by the desire to try to flee something painful about our experience with the present which i quite which i quite liked and um we think about um well perhaps we could talk about the attention economy and how that feeds kind of our desire to be distracted and sort of be feel like we're achieving something whereas actually we're not achieving anything sure i mean i i don't know the individual details of people watching this but i don't feel that any of you are likely to need a sort of basic introduction to the idea of of the attention economy what i'm what i'm trying to explore in the book is well two points really firstly how the firstly that attention is so fundamental to the experience of life that calling it a resource like a limited resource people talk about it is almost uh a misnomer you know it's it there's a sense in which attention just is life and and what you pay attention to over the course of your life will sum up to what your life will have been so it's an incredibly uh serious thing to be involved with either as a user of technology or as or as someone working in uh digital technology but also secondly this thing that i don't think gets us enough attention which is you know i have many many criticisms of social media platforms and algorithmically driven you know attention mining effectively but but we talk a lot as if this is a sort of force that we i mean if you if you read a lot of stuff or you watch you know the social dilemma et cetera you you might be left with the impression that the the typical moment of digital distraction is one in which you know i'm sort of working away on a piece of writing and i'm feeling thrilled by it and it's so wonderful and i'm really enjoying myself and then um like somehow the the evil tendrils of silicon valley come and sort of grab me unwillingly away from my from my work and i do think that some of the tendrils of silicon valley are evil and that we should talk critically about them but that's not what happens what happens is i'm finding the work unpleasant or intimidating or boring or difficult and i am thrilled by the opportunity to go and scroll through down my phone for a bit instead and do something to leave or to leave aside something that i thought was what really mattered to me and go and do something that by definition if it's distraction like doesn't matter to me yeah and so i'm looking in the book at the idea that basically what's going on here is that that um you know it's not a coincidence that things that matter to us induce discomfort um they bring us up against the limits of our capacities and our ability to control how time unfolds you're writing a chapter of your novel you don't know that it's going to go well you don't know you've got what it takes you don't know that people will receive it well it might be forgotten or ignored or mocked you want to have an important difficult conversation with your spouse you don't know how it's going to unfold it might leave you feeling emotionally emotionally vulnerable it might lead to an angry exchange you know you can't you don't have that control it's precisely because these things matter that they evoke these uncomfortable feelings and then i think it feels absolutely wonderful to do something uh less important instead and to sort of zone out and i think the phenomenology of the internet is a super interesting part of this because actually these days we've always been distractible for these reasons but these days not only samuel johnson wrote about it but not only do we have reason to flee the stuff we care about because of discomfort but we have a place to go when we're fleeing it that phenomenologically speaking does feel kind of limitless it does feel like um a a realm where limits don't apply where you can portray yourself how you like find out about things that are happening thousands and thousands of miles away in virtually no time at all um it's very seductive as a as a as a way not to confront the the sort of limitations of being a human creature in time but i do think that ultimately it's only by confronting some of those limitations that we that we make progress on the things that we that we care about so it's uh getting finding some way to tolerate or accommodate or get friendly with that discomfort i think is a pretty much a superpower when it comes to thriving in the modern world no no i certainly struggle that i know every time i delete myself on purpose forget my password for social media i get distracted by the news or putting on the radio or something something else um well the second half of your book uh really speaks about the concept of time and how we how we define it and how we think about it i thought i might just read a small section which really spoke to me at the beginning of chapter eight sure um there's another sense in which treating time is something that we own and get to control seems to make life worse inevitably we become obsessed with using it well whereupon we discover an unfortunate truth the more you focus on using time well the more each day begins to feel like something you have to get through on route to some karma better more fulfilling point in the future which never actually arrives this this future chasing or i think you call it like the when i finally view of ourselves i mean is it is that just part of the human condition is that something we can we can acknowledge i know i know i'm always sort of doing something to get to the next stage um how do you how how have you thought about that and how we can for one of a better phrase live more in the moment yeah such a big question we can come to that because i i have thoughts about that but um yeah i think that um i i don't i think that an instrumental approach to experience right to using to to doing things now for some future gain is absolutely sort of you know as old as humanity nothing would ever get done if people couldn't sort of persevere to to do things and building civilization would never have would never have happened i think then once we all enter into this very instrumentalized notion of time that we were talking about at the beginning where we're all trying to use not only up the resources around us but we're thinking of time as a resource to use well then again it becomes something we have to do i wouldn't have written this book if i wasn't willing to instrumentalize time in a certain in a certain sense and nobody would ever get anything done in their in their professional lives if they didn't so i'm really talking about a kind of over investment in that stance a sense that i think is driven especially by the economic system that we live in and the stage that that's at now excuse me where it becomes the only form of value it all too easily that sort of instrumental mindset just sort of forces everything else out so so in other words you come to think about every moment of time only or pretty much only in terms of its value for some future moment of time and that when it's taken to that absolute place that that clearly is self-defeating and an irrational and and unfortunate uh way to be because it's um you know by definition you're going to you're placing the val the whole value of life constantly uh at some point that is not now and it only ever is now so you're never going to kind of cash out the value of life and find value in the moment so i think it's about sort of having the ability to take both of those perspectives it's certainly i don't recommend and i certainly have never retained myself the ability to care only about this precise moment um and not where it's leading but i think that you know over investment in that we see the effects of that all around us in sort of sapping the meaning from people's lives like what is this all for because they're aware on some level that what it's all for when they get to the time when it's supposedly all four it'll all still be for something in the future from then as well and and so on it felt like trying to find the fun in the moment and perhaps we you think about childhood where you know nursery leads to reception reception leads to this year and you know you're then working towards university and university more than job is for retirement and at which point is yeah at what point are you sort of having fun in the in the moment right right um perhaps you could um you talk about you know within within our con how we work with time and what we think about it um rediscovering rest and hobbies for the sake of it and perhaps you know when we think about having more fun do do we do enough things enough activities which we only do for their own sake you just moved to yorkshire where you probably have more opportunities to go for a walk in the in the in the countryside yeah i'm really i'm having a walk yeah i'm really putting my claims to the test here because i've got no excuse left anymore not to spend a significant chunk of my time hiking on the north york moors and uh so if i don't then i really am condemned uh as a as a failure of uh embracing the moment so we shall see i've been here two weeks i've been on a couple of hikes um i'll report back later um i think that um you know this instrumental this exclusive focus on the instrumental use of time uh is sort of at its most ironic in the context of leisure because like it's if you're even treating your leisure as a means to an end solely as a means to an end then like what what's left the the certainly the sort of ancient greek speaking broadly conception of leisure was that it was the the goal of everything else so you maybe had to work um and you maybe had to do all sorts of things but but but the reason you were doing them all was so that you could get the time the leisure time that was that was sort of life uh in its highest expression which admittedly for ancient philosophers tends to mean what you should do with that time is like philosophy they were that was a so that's not this doesn't necessarily follow but so i'm sort of making the case in the book for something that the the contemporary philosopher kieran satya has described as atylic activities things that you do not because of what they're leading up to or amounting to that are not defined by some kind of end point hiking is a fun example um just because um you know anyone who has any experience of enjoying a walk in the country knows you you probably drive the car to a car park somewhere and then you either go in a loop back to the car or you walk you know a few miles to a to an extreme point and turn around and come back if you wanted to do either of those things most efficiently the simplest way would just be not to go on the hike in the first place um all you're doing is getting getting back to where you started now there are instrumental benefits you know there are you can it's a it's good for your physical fitness uh you um might be like recording your route on all these social um apps for for you know now that enable you to share your um the views that you're gazing out over but basically you hike to hike and as cetera says you know there's not going to become a you're not going to get to a point in your life where you think um okay i've done all the hiking i'd aim to do that job is complete you are going to stop but you're not going to stop because you've reached the end of a project or exhausted an activity you're just going to stop because eventually you will or your interest might change or you may be too old and frail to continue or any number of things and that kind of i think that's i think that's what the the i think that's what is crystallized in the idea of a hobby and i think it's probably why the idea of a hobby feels a little bit cringe and embarrassing in the modern world right unlike as i say but unlike side hustles which are hobbies that have a very clear instrumental value that you're going to make money out of them and they are they are cool and hip and and it's good to have a side hustle it's kind of embarrassing to have a hobby and i think that that is at least in part because they don't fit and they are sort of culturally subversive in a way uh they don't they don't fit into this idea that everything has got to be for something else and quite possibly that something else is is financial profit but not necessarily it's just it's all for something other than itself and that's not true of uh you know of going on a hike um yeah so yeah that's that's that's very cool um i've written on my notes here um painting staring which uh i've not i've not yet had the time to go and find three hours to do this but perhaps you could talk about i've i've i haven't got the the name of the lady who suggested doing it but perhaps you could talk about that and what you found in in taking three hours out of the data stairs painting yeah totally i mean this is this is the part of the book where i'm writing about patience and impatience and i think that um one way to understand the feeling of impatience that is that is uh you know as ubiquitous today as ever it's another example of the way we rail against our limitation right and in that case it's the limitation of how fast we can force the rest of the world to to go um [Music] and this idea that certain activities just take the time they take and and sort of dictate their own speed and we just have to if we want to get the benefit of them we just have to fit around that instead of trying to constantly uh accelerate them up to the level where we would feel like we were the ones in control of them there's a art historian at harvard called uh jennifer roberts who um asks all her incoming students to do this exercise where they have to select a painting or a sculpture in the cambridge boston area and go and look at it for three hours straight um [Music] i think they're allowed to take bathroom breaks but that's it right it's just you just you you you sit there stand there i think you know folding chairs are useful here and um i looked at three hours and the point is you know she knows that's a crazily long amount of time but she knows that how people react to that her insight is that um it's very easy to think that you've seen a painting just because you've looked at it for a couple of seconds uh and that the tempo of life that her students are exposed to today through technology through the hyper-competitive atmosphere at universities like harvard and all the rest of it is such that like she needs to play a role as a teacher in deliberately making the tempo be much much much much slower to sort of make them go through the discomfort of staying in that one place to the point where you you can then see things you know i mean you really do see things in a painting if you look for that sort of absurdly long amount of time and i went to do this i went to meet her harvard and i sat at in the harvard art museums and did a and looked at a painting by uh dagar uh for three hours taking notes that's loud um and you know i spent the first half hour thinking i'd totally chosen the wrong painting i should have chosen something with more to look at which was just a manifestation of the impatience right and you go through then another hour of sort of all kinds of fidgety awful discomfort but on the other side of that you i genuinely did literally see things in this painting uh that i hadn't seen until then uh i'm not i'm not using c metaphorically to mean like i had thoughts about what it could mean i literally saw shadows and facial expressions and lines that seemed to suggest areas of space that i hadn't previously seen it's extraordinary and um it's just a sort of slightly extreme example of the benefit of letting something that you're engaged with take its time i think a more day-to-day example uh stop me if you want to be on something else but more day-to-day example of this is just like reading especially kind of reading fiction people me particularly right people say these days that they don't they can't find time to read that's a very common complaint and i think it's true to some extent but mainly i don't think people mean that they don't have a half hour in a 24-hour period when they could read a book some people are that busy but i think a lot of us are not it's that when we find that half hour and sit down with say a novel we don't we're too sort of um amped up and to running too fast to to slow down to the speed that reading a novel or reading a lot of non-fiction books too um requires so your sort of the flywheel is turning so fast that it feels really unpleasant to to slow it down so naturally you know people want to read summaries and synopsis or find techniques of speed reading to to bring reading up to the speed of of the the rest of life um and i think those do have some benefits for just sort of sheer information absorption but the real experience of reading a good book is just one that like there's a little amount of acceleration you can you can bring to it but beyond that it's just it just takes the time it takes it's given by the book the speed right it's not given by you you don't get to um dictate how fast it goes i guess just finally on this topic i always think it's so fascinating how as technology has made has caused it to take much much much less time to to do things that previously took a long time uh we actually get more and more impatient rather than less impatient yeah why is it so much more frustrating to wait eight seconds for a really badly slow loading web page than like three days to be sent some information in the mail it's like it shouldn't be that way we should be like feeling so relaxed and expansive about how much time we have and the idea i explore in the book is that part of what's going on here is just that we have now thanks to uh technological developments got to the point where it really does feel like we are almost able to do everything we want instantaneously almost able to cook our food in zero seconds flat because it only takes two minutes in the microwave almost able to find any information that we want uh you know with without any perceptible time delay and so in that situation of feeling like you are very nearly uh god it's way more frustrating to run up against the remaining ways in which you aren't you know the the fact that novels still take time to consume the fact that there are some slow loading web pages the fact that it does take two whole minutes uh to heat some food in the microwave instead of zero um if you work in an office with a microwave it's always been cancelled out at like seven seconds because i'm sure people tell themselves because their food was ready but actually i think it's because they're just like they couldn't wait they couldn't bear it anymore and that's the moment at which they were like ah screw this i'm just gonna take the food out because i cannot bring myself to wait these seconds it's really you know i i this is totally anecdotal but i think that people get um more impatient and angrier in in traffic in road traffic now that so much of our life is lived on smartphones operating at broadband speeds because i feel like it the contrast between uh so much of what we can do and the material obstacles of the cars in front just gets more and more pronounced and enraging i wondered if the pandemic had in any way exasperated that because we now do even more online when we're used to food being delivered as and when we want it that when we interact with the physical world yeah those frustrations i don't know a year of living inside i think has to an extent made us even more unaccepting of the slowness of the real world um could be yeah i don't know that and i think there are also advanced i think there are also things we see afresh and appreciate and value about the concrete material world as a result of the time you know the time in the pandemic but yeah it's certainly plausible definitely yeah uh if you have any questions uh whilst watching please add them in the in the chat window um we'll get to those after i've spoken uh asked you about well let's say that we have um embraced our finitude and we've decided which big rocks we want to put into our jar what are some tips that you would give us to start embracing this lifestyle what can we what can we actively do now to kind of to to be better at this it's a really good question yeah you should end the book you speak about yes it's a really good question i am a little bit conflicted about answering it because i do think that ultimately this is about a shift in perspective it is about seeing things differently i don't mean that i expect people to sort of read my book and have a sort of instant spiritual enlightenment experience i it can be a small perspective shift i think it is a so i think it is mainly about sort of feeling your way into this limit embracing mindset and what you find then sometimes is that it's really obvious what techniques or methods you should use to implement that or take one thing i've found for example is that you know productivity techniques i experimented with years ago but did so then in the spirit of trying to become the perfect controller of my time they're perfectly useful ways to organize the day now but i'm holding them much more loosely as a result of having felt my way somewhat into this this different mindset that said i definitely think there are some approaches to organizing work and life for example that that make more sense and that go with this mindset more than more than others one whole set of them is any kind of technique or approach to work that focuses on sort of serializing on sequent or making big projects sequential on getting closer to that state of doing one thing at a time whether that's literally on the level of the individual task or on the level of major projects sort of making most of them cue and line up behind one that you're focusing on now and moving it through and finishing it so the kanban approach to workflow management that i'm sure many people be familiar with uh there's a there's a great book called personal kanban by um jim benson and tony anne barry about applying this uh kind of that kind of approach which is obviously a team approach to your individual workflow there are lots of other ways i give a very simple one in the book about well let me stop and pause the point is all these things having progress all these things have in common is that they limit your work in progress they say okay here are the 40 things that feel like they matter and here are the three or so that i'm going to give my attention to and i'm not going to move on to the others until at least one of those three is is completed so you sort of bring yourself to live with the anxiety of knowing that all these other things are going uncompleted in order to bring something uh to completion and then just quickly you know i think i think all sort of time boxing and time blocking approaches can be well adapted to this to this mindset if you say i'm going to try to ring fence two or three hours of the morning for um sort of focused work that really matters to me and i'm going to try to limit my email processing time to an hour and a half towards the end of the day in both those cases what you're saying is you're not saying i'm going to finish this project today or i'm going to get to the bottom of my email today you're going time first you're saying i'm going to dedicate this amount of time to it i'm going to stop at the end of that time that's kind of a way of thinking about your schedule that really respects the finitude of your time instead of one that goes tasks first and says i've got to get through this whole list come what may and then you find you know that you're still at your desk at 11 p.m and the list just got twice as long during the course of day anyway i think you've actually if we can bring up julie julie's question i think you've actually kind of answered this uh so based on oliver's thoughts on the negativity of distraction i'm curious to hear his take on multitasking and how we can do it in a more time efficient manner i feel like you're saying don't do multitasking yeah i mean it's a little there's a there's some there are some subtleties here there are there's research that show you know certain forms of multitasking with using different kinds of attentional channels and stuff can be that can work i don't tell people they shouldn't listen to a podcast while they're doing the vacuuming or something you can you can combine tasks meaningfully in that way when it comes to our sort of focused focused attention on on sort of mentally taxing tasks um you basically just can't multitask anyway and if you think that you are doing what you're really doing is rapidly switching between things between keeping half an eye on your email inbox and a piece of writing you're trying to do say and calling it multitasking and i think that generally what happens there i think there are personality differences i don't want to tell people they definitely should never do it but generally what happens there if you have um you know three or four or five potential destinations for your attention at any moment is that as soon as any one of them gets difficult or challenging you just bounce off to one that's a bit easier and i think this probably especially happens more on the level of projects as opposed to tasks in other words to some degree manage your moment-to-moment tasks how you like but if you are really telling yourself that say in my case it could be three articles that i really care about if i'm really telling myself that all of those three are going to be kind of moved forward roughly at the same time or during the same period of time all that happens is that the moment one of them becomes difficult because guess what meaningful and important things feel difficult and uncomfortable you just move to the other one so you add you end up managing to make no progress on them because you're just sort of escaping the difficulty at each point so um you know it's not that you can't ever combine tasks or don't ever need to keep an eye on some on your email while doing something else but that like if you see what's going on there and you become more conscious of it you're much more likely to be able to avoid this situation of like not really doing anything because what you're actually doing in those contexts is pursuing the emotional feeling of being in control taking care of business having fingers in pies uh at the expense of getting things done that that you care about brilliant look let's take peter's question is this the midlife crisis book like this do you need to have changed extreme do you need to have chased extreme productivity first and having achieved common life goals family career financial to begin seeking a new perspective on time it's such a good question there's two interpretations of it right is it is this did this book emerge from my having a midlife crisis probably in some sense and then is it only useful for people who are at that stage and i i tried very consciously in in writing this book to not make it a book that was only uh beneficial to people who'd sort of exhausted all those techniques or perhaps what i mean is to point out certain truths about how those techniques work that might um that might accelerate uh a sort of profitable kind of crisis in someone who is uh you know uh in their 30s or their late 20s rather than in their 40s like me um i think there's some truth to this right i think that that that one of the easiest ways to uh understand the limitations of this kind of uh limit denying approach to life is to pursue it very energetically for a number of years and exhaust it and and realize that a different method is is required and i also think that many of the sort of things that people achieve in the first half of adulthood um which is often things like you know establishing themselves in a career separating off from their family of origin and being part of a of their own family um you know these things are can be done with and perhaps even sometimes catalyzed by a sort of unrealistic belief in the degree of your control over your life i guess i i guess i just end up by saying that i don't think it is ever um unhelpful to to see how reality is when it comes to time when it comes to our limitations i don't think it's something that you can only understand at a certain point in life and i don't think it's something that um that it's beneficial to sort of have kept from it to have kept from you as an earlier stage of life you know i'll be honest i think it would be i would be surprised if there were sort of 16 17 year olds who who thought that this book spoke to them i would be very gratified but i think it probably is something that comes from i also think that the age at which people encounter the sort of impossible demands of the world that we've created is clearly getting lower right the age of which people say the wage in which people complain about burnout i mean this is that burnout is a thing that people encounter in their 20s now judging by all sorts of reports and books and studies um not something that you have to have got into your sort of mid 50s uh before you've before you're sort of exhausted enough to encounter it so i think that hopefully the relevance of this the age at which this book is relevant to people is is falling as the uh as the world gets uh more and more insane with respect to timing the pace of acceleration is accelerating is healthy let's take mario's tour mario's question uh thanks to the talk my question is about attention span uh is there any reliable evidence on shortened attention spans as patients in the modern world uh is it real or is it a myth did you do any research on on this attention span is a really weird concept it's a very good question attention span is a really weird concept that i um have tried to understand and don't write about in the book because it just seems extremely uh it it sort of falls apart on on closer in inspection patience i think there's good reason to believe um that um that we sort of tolerate shorter and shorter amounts of time that it takes to do things or to have information communicated to us there's all sorts of fascinating longitudinal research on like the the length of edits in movies and the length of political speeches and uh sort of things like that that at least seem to be responding to a desire for um shorter and shorter bits of focus um i think that yeah i don't i i don't think that it's the most useful way to think about what's happening to our attention to think about that we are um less and less able to focus for extended periods of time i think it is probably more helpful and certainly more clearly true anyway that we are more and more tempted to abandon those focused periods of time and that there are more and more services and devices only too willing to you know use cutting-edge technology to keep us distracted once we have left those uh those that that focus for for distraction so it's in a way you're talking about attention span there but in a way you're talking about the sense that there are other possibilities and if you find yourself in a hut on a mountainside with no internet access and nothing to do but write your novel you're more likely to write your novel not because you've suddenly developed a long attention span but because um alternatives have been taken away from you the the sort of tormenting choice of other options is gone for a while yeah i find when i really need to get something done i will leave my phone and laptop home and take a notepad and a pen to a coffee shop and that's that i can't do anything else except yeah get through that yeah uh i'd love to know um how are you thinking about teaching this to your you have a son how are you thinking about teaching this how can we how can we what should we be teaching our children about this this concept such an interesting question and i don't feel like he's four turning five so i still really don't feel like i know what i'm doing when it comes to parenting and also he keeps getting older and changing so what anything i do learn becomes out of date um i you know i have been sort of fascinated and slightly dismayed just they obviously everyone says it's about kids right they reflect your your own personality back to you in ways that are often uncomfortable you know that when he started to sort of ask what we were doing next what we're doing next and trying to like get a schedule for the day into his head i was like oh my god i've really totally inculcated productivity geekhood uh into him and i'm hoping that uh you know i i think i see that being out here in uh more spending more time in nature is is something that sort of seeps into his uh bones i tell you what i think is the the most sort of uh daunting lesson that i have learned about inculcating lessons i guess is that uh you really have to do it yourself if you want the kid to do it too in other words you if you want to be if you want your child to grow up to be someone who isn't checking their phone every three seconds you have to not check your phone every three seconds and even more weirdly i think it's true that you have to not be i mean he doesn't have a phone but you know what i mean he's already he you know he's he's very interested by screens that are in the house and that's fine but i don't want him to be completely fixated by them not only do you have to be better at yourself in their presence but you sort of have to genuinely live it in your whole life even when they're in bed it's a really strange kind of uh almost kind of uh paranormal phenomenon or something right that like um you can't just uh put them to bed and then for two hours become a completely scattered uh terrible user of time or or something like that if you really want to model those lessons so that's what i'm sort of grappling with i don't want to make it sound entirely to do with screens that's just sort of everyone's always worrying about that so much but like to be present in the moment like i feel like the very best thing i can do is to be better at that and do you think do you think writing the book as a self-confessed um time management do you think writing the book has helped you become better at you know yeah no definitely i think lots of people sometimes assume the way books get written is you sort of have a great insight and then you set it down in in writing but for me the experience of the writing this book was that i did sort of have to as i discovered what i thought about time through writing it i did have to sort of become more of that become more of that person uh partly it's just accountability right i mean if i'm going to give some talk somewhere and someone spots me like impatiently freaking out about how like long the microwave is taking then i'm kind of it's pretty embarrassing but but more generally and more authentically you know it's just like no i i understand intellectually a huge number of things to be true now about time that i previously didn't and then the long haul is kind of living into those uh intellectual realizations and i've and i've done it somewhat and i've got a long way to go wonderful well oliver thank you so much for joining us today it's been it's been genuinely insightful i can't recommend the book enough available in audio you said you've done the audio book as well so yes that's available uh i have not done one of these talks and and put as many post-it notes inside it um as ever uh so yeah genuinely recommend uh is a great read for everyone a good use of one of your four thousand weeks i think was a quote i've stolen from another review online um thank you so on behalf of everyone watching now and in the future thank you so much for joining us hopefully one day for your next book you can join us in the office i will be delightful um otherwise oliver thank you so much for joining us today thank you it's been a pleasure i really enjoyed it and great questions thank you thank you [Music]

                "content": "[Music] hello and welcome to talks with google my name is robin worthy and i'm delighted you could join us either today or live on the youtube catch up we are joined today by oliver berkman author of 4 000 weeks time and how to use it uh oliver is the author of the antidote happiness for people who can't stand positive thinking and for many years wrote a popular weekly column on psychology for the guardian this column will change your life here's a devoted following for his writing on productivity mortality the power of limits and be building a meaningful life in an age of bewilderment uh please join me in thanking oliver for joining us today oliver hi thanks very much for inviting me this is great thank you so much for coming uh well look i am genuinely excited about talking to you uh three four four thousand weeks uh i i i've so many questions so many thoughts about it perhaps you could start by telling us what does four thousand weeks represent why why the why the title of the book so four thousand weeks is extremely approximately the average human lifespan in the west expressed in terms of weeks if you live to be 80 you'll have had a few more than that as i'm sure people can figure out it's pretty straightforward mental arithmetic but it's um i i completely rounded it to a uh to a sort of punchy round number it's it's it's basically how much we can reasonably expect to get to to get to play with in terms it feels like a very small number when represented in which indeed even those who live to be a hundred it's the order of six thousand weeks it's not it's not it's not a lot right no there's something very interesting about weeks because if you express it in days well it's it's a very large number if you press it in years it's very small but we get the scent we have the feeling that a year lasts goes on forever so it doesn't really matter it's that it's that middle zone where you're expressing it in a relatively small number of a quantity that nonetheless we feel is very brief and irrelevant in the course of our lives it doesn't seem like if you waste a week of your life it ought to matter yeah that's very cool um so the book broadly uh speaks about um how do we choose what we choose so that's we can kind of touch upon some of those those subjects um you open by talking about um acknowledging and embracing the the limit embracing life and how time has perhaps had a different meaning to people over the ages perhaps you could talk about that um and how we think about time now yeah sure i mean i think par part of what i find myself doing in talking about this book is is sort of deflecting a potential interpretation of that title i mean i'm glad i've we gave this book an attention grabbing title but there's a misinterpretation i think which would be like okay this is time is incredibly short therefore the only way to make the most use of of it is to live in a kind of white knuckle um very self-conscious and and strenuous attempt to sort of eke the most out of every day and you know do extreme sports every weekend and uh and uh you know never never lose a second and i think that actually what i'm trying to get at here is that there's a huge amount of relief as well as energy and motivation and focus that comes from acknowledging how limited we are with respect to time and thus seeing all the different ways in which we can talk about this i'm sure you know especially in kind of productivity culture and time management but not only all the ways in which we we we proceed as if we might find a way to fit everything in we might find a way to become so efficient as to not have to encounter the the ramifications of being finite so it's really about a sort of dropping back down to the ground and uh making time for a handful of things that really matter and giving up this impossible struggle to sort of uh be infinite with respect to time as opposed to this kind of very exhausting and rather stressful kind of carpe diem approach which you do see in popular culture which i think ultimately is actually just another form of the of the attitude that i'm uh criticizing uh in the book to go even further into sort of unseating our conventional views of time yes you're right i think there's lots of good evidence that the example i hear in the book is english medieval peasants although i think it would also apply to many different cultures at different times in history perhaps also to some indigenous cultures today that this whole notion of time as something separate from you time is as a resource that you have to use well or that you could be guilty of wasting or that you need to sort of save through efficiency techniques the whole conceptual basis of that distinction uh i think we can confidently say just wouldn't have occurred to a kind of working class laborer in early medieval england right um time for for them and for many other people it would have followed the patterns that anthropologists call task orientation right so instead of thinking about your activities as lined up against a schedule or a timeline or a calendar or something it's the tasks themselves that would have given the rhythm to the day time would have just been the medium in which your life unfolded rather than something that you could sort of psychologically objectify and then be tormented by or try to dominate or feel hounded by and you know the productivity guru who had gone up to a medieval farmer and said like why don't you uh do all the milking for the month uh all in one day to get it out of the way because batching your tasks is a really great way to to get more things done i mean obviously that would have been lunacy and still today it's essentially you know lunacy as an approach to milking cows because those things just need doing when they need doing and crops need harvesting when they need harvesting and you know i think we all or many of us have some experience of this kind of time i think that one very obvious example is in the first few months with a newborn baby but i think that you don't have to be a parent to have been in places where that kind of sense of the schedule the sense of the timetable falls away and you're just sort of in time uh it has its disadvantages because you you can't build a sort of industrial technologically advanced society without without um that objectified idea of time but it has some big advantages as well which are a kind of peace of mind that i think is a lot harder for us to access uh today it was um you spoke about when you um time used to be measured in how long it takes to do a task so having to take instead of just using a minute or an hour you'd say all the time it takes to bring in the hair or milk the cat bring the hair milk out it actually made me think of i have a i have a five-year-old daughter and we measure time in the length of her favorite tv shows like how long would it take to get to this bus stop well at the time it takes to watch two of these shows so actually for children who don't understand minutes and hours we still use task based times i thought was quite interesting yeah no it's fascinating and even that kind of comparison like i don't think that would have been the normal way of talking my understanding of the literature is it wouldn't have been a normal way of talking about time it's just that when you had to do some comparing like there wasn't the widespread notion there wasn't the white there wasn't a sort of um widespread adoption of clocks or of time measuring devices among ordinary people so yeah you just have to grasp for some other for some other task as a as a comparator and you know people tend to think that life moved more slowly back then as another example of this but i think that probably that concept of life moving slowly would have been the thing that didn't make sense if you sort of time travel back to medieval england it's not that life moved more slowly but just like what slowly as compared to watch i mean it's just life it's just unfolding it's only a sort of post-industrialization that it is ubiquitous uh to think about life unfolding according to something that isn't life uh a time a timeline or a yardstick um you get it in ancient greece and rome like you get all sorts of things but it's that's a that's a new thing for for almost everybody in the world to be um thinking as a way of governing their lives and perhaps post internet we not only compare ourselves to how much we can family today but how much others are able or seem to be able to cram into a day and so the question of oh how do i do all of the things it's not just all of those those those big rocks that i want to accomplish but that others seem to be doing which i think uh perhaps you could talk about your dislike of the big rocks parable which for those i imagine that many those dudes but for those who don't know it's the it's it's how do you fit the big rocks the small box and the sand into a jar the idea being you have to put the big rocks in first and then the smaller things can fit around those but you dislike that for a very good reason well this is a metaphor for prioritization and it says you know if you want to have time to do everything that counts just make sure you make time first for the things that that really matter um yeah i mean i i think there is some wisdom in here but but the my basic objection is that this is a this is a rigged experiment the uh the person in the in the parable who is bringing these rocks and pebbles and sand into the classroom or seminar room or whether it's supposed to happen has only brought enough rocks uh that he knows in advance will will fit into the jar um and i don't think that our primary problem on the level of individual time management today is that we prioritize things badly although we do i think it is that there are too many big rocks there are too many things that genuinely matter and you know if we had 40 hours in a day we could still fill that time with things that genuinely matter it it isn't that if you find the right tricks and techniques you'll be able to get rid of only all the unimportant tedious stuff and then spend your life in this kind of unfolding of just pure meaningfulness and feel like you're doing everything it's like no you're gonna have to not do lots of things that do matter uh in order to make time for the things that you that you care about the most out of those out of those things let's talk about the efficiency traps so you talk about uh the the curse perhaps of clearing the decks we all come in and i've seen people block out the first hour of their calendars to clear emails you talk about how that actually creates more work right i mean this is something that i'm sure a number of people watching will be familiar with in in other contexts right this general idea which crops up as all sorts of other paradoxes the jevons paradox in in energy efficiency and a bunch of others but if you make a system more efficient without regard to any other governing value you just pursue greater efficiency in processing things through the system then all else being equal the system will fill with more and more stuff rather than bringing peace of mind and will or um or like empty time or capacity and it will um fill with with more and more junk rather than uh good stuff so applied to time management the idea here is you know if you get incredibly good at processing your email all else being equal what will happen is you'll just get more email uh because you'll reply to people and they'll reply to you and those replies will generate replies and they'll go forever you get a reputation for being responsive to email so more people will reach out to email you and just in general email unless it's stopped by some other act on your part email will just come to dominate your life more and more in direct contradiction to your motive initial motivation to uh to sort of bring email under control this is you know this is parkinson's law work expands to fill the time available for its completion um it's that thing where they widen motorways to relieve traffic congestion and it makes the uh it provides an added incentive for more drivers to use that route and so the the congestion sort of tends gradually back towards where it originally was so when i'm talking about the efficiency trap i'm talking about a thing which i think is encouraged by a lot of sort of less good productivity advice and productivity culture which is this idea that there is some inherent benefit in just getting more efficient at doing more things in a smaller amount of time firstly there's no benefit in doing things per se unless they're the good the right things to do and then secondly yeah you get into this problem where where um the more stuff that comes across your radar the the more likely you are to accept additional things to do that actually aren't worth your time because none of these incoming things will have to meet this um filter or me sort of get over this hurdle of is this worth sacrificing something else for because you've convinced yourself that you're gonna have time for for everything when i was working as a journalist on a sort of day-to-day as a feature writer at the guardian um yeah the the better i got at doing stuff the more more efficient i got at doing stuff the the more i began to realize what i was really good at was doing stuff that didn't matter and that the things that i really cared about would just get endlessly postponed while i told myself yeah i was clearing the decks which was your original question and we could talk more about that but anyway i'll stop there for now no that's really cool um and i certainly know when when i clear the decks i actually get a little um like an endorphin rush for having done something like that the element of completeness but um and i don't want to perhaps address the more difficult task um but let's talk about um you talk about finitude and pronounce that correctly uh which which i've sort of summarized is acknowledging our mortality which sounds very a bit bleak but actually when you when you accept that and think about it it can be liberating perhaps you could talk about that concept you've you've coined i mean i didn't invent the word finitude people have people do wonder about how to pronounce it all i can say is in the audiobook for this i say finitude a lot so i really i really hope that's the right uh the right pronunciation i i just mean yes i this is a consequence of the fact that we die but i don't think that this book is really about you know it's not really about death and dying and mortality and that kind of very melodramatic kind of and very difficult uh aspect of human existence it's not about suggesting that anyone can sort of completely confront their mortality i don't think i certainly don't think i have um but rather the fact that our time is limited and that we are sort of material creatures in limited time with limited energy and limited attentional bandwidth and and all the rest of it the consequence of this i'm sort of wrapping up in this word finitude to refer to the state of being limited and therefore having to make by definition you know trade-offs and to exist in a world of opportunity costs and having to make tough decisions not being able to do all the things that we are you know psychologically able to think about and imagine not being able to meet all the demands that society might throw at us there's just no reason to assume that if we can think of something or somebody can ask something of us uh that there's capacity for it in a in a human in a human life uh uh beyond a certain point there won't be and uh these kind of sacrifices will just be be built into the situation so i think what i'm saying for a big chunk of the book is that like this is such an uncomfortable feeling that we pursue all sorts of uh ultimately counterproductive activities to sort of engage in emotional avoidance to feel like we're limitless when we're not i think that a lot of uh distraction is is based on is rooted in that we could talk about that if you like and i think a lot of time management stuff and certainly the years i spent as a sort of weirdo productivity geek um still am a little bit but you know recovering maybe they were it was about trying to achieve a kind of control over my time and my projects and my work in my life that would you know that subliminally would enable you not to have me not to have to confront this i think situation yeah you do you define distraction is motivated by the desire to try to flee something painful about our experience with the present which i quite which i quite liked and um we think about um well perhaps we could talk about the attention economy and how that feeds kind of our desire to be distracted and sort of be feel like we're achieving something whereas actually we're not achieving anything sure i mean i i don't know the individual details of people watching this but i don't feel that any of you are likely to need a sort of basic introduction to the idea of of the attention economy what i'm what i'm trying to explore in the book is well two points really firstly how the firstly that attention is so fundamental to the experience of life that calling it a resource like a limited resource people talk about it is almost uh a misnomer you know it's it there's a sense in which attention just is life and and what you pay attention to over the course of your life will sum up to what your life will have been so it's an incredibly uh serious thing to be involved with either as a user of technology or as or as someone working in uh digital technology but also secondly this thing that i don't think gets us enough attention which is you know i have many many criticisms of social media platforms and algorithmically driven you know attention mining effectively but but we talk a lot as if this is a sort of force that we i mean if you if you read a lot of stuff or you watch you know the social dilemma et cetera you you might be left with the impression that the the typical moment of digital distraction is one in which you know i'm sort of working away on a piece of writing and i'm feeling thrilled by it and it's so wonderful and i'm really enjoying myself and then um like somehow the the evil tendrils of silicon valley come and sort of grab me unwillingly away from my from my work and i do think that some of the tendrils of silicon valley are evil and that we should talk critically about them but that's not what happens what happens is i'm finding the work unpleasant or intimidating or boring or difficult and i am thrilled by the opportunity to go and scroll through down my phone for a bit instead and do something to leave or to leave aside something that i thought was what really mattered to me and go and do something that by definition if it's distraction like doesn't matter to me yeah and so i'm looking in the book at the idea that basically what's going on here is that that um you know it's not a coincidence that things that matter to us induce discomfort um they bring us up against the limits of our capacities and our ability to control how time unfolds you're writing a chapter of your novel you don't know that it's going to go well you don't know you've got what it takes you don't know that people will receive it well it might be forgotten or ignored or mocked you want to have an important difficult conversation with your spouse you don't know how it's going to unfold it might leave you feeling emotionally emotionally vulnerable it might lead to an angry exchange you know you can't you don't have that control it's precisely because these things matter that they evoke these uncomfortable feelings and then i think it feels absolutely wonderful to do something uh less important instead and to sort of zone out and i think the phenomenology of the internet is a super interesting part of this because actually these days we've always been distractible for these reasons but these days not only samuel johnson wrote about it but not only do we have reason to flee the stuff we care about because of discomfort but we have a place to go when we're fleeing it that phenomenologically speaking does feel kind of limitless it does feel like um a a realm where limits don't apply where you can portray yourself how you like find out about things that are happening thousands and thousands of miles away in virtually no time at all um it's very seductive as a as a as a way not to confront the the sort of limitations of being a human creature in time but i do think that ultimately it's only by confronting some of those limitations that we that we make progress on the things that we that we care about so it's uh getting finding some way to tolerate or accommodate or get friendly with that discomfort i think is a pretty much a superpower when it comes to thriving in the modern world no no i certainly struggle that i know every time i delete myself on purpose forget my password for social media i get distracted by the news or putting on the radio or something something else um well the second half of your book uh really speaks about the concept of time and how we how we define it and how we think about it i thought i might just read a small section which really spoke to me at the beginning of chapter eight sure um there's another sense in which treating time is something that we own and get to control seems to make life worse inevitably we become obsessed with using it well whereupon we discover an unfortunate truth the more you focus on using time well the more each day begins to feel like something you have to get through on route to some karma better more fulfilling point in the future which never actually arrives this this future chasing or i think you call it like the when i finally view of ourselves i mean is it is that just part of the human condition is that something we can we can acknowledge i know i know i'm always sort of doing something to get to the next stage um how do you how how have you thought about that and how we can for one of a better phrase live more in the moment yeah such a big question we can come to that because i i have thoughts about that but um yeah i think that um i i don't i think that an instrumental approach to experience right to using to to doing things now for some future gain is absolutely sort of you know as old as humanity nothing would ever get done if people couldn't sort of persevere to to do things and building civilization would never have would never have happened i think then once we all enter into this very instrumentalized notion of time that we were talking about at the beginning where we're all trying to use not only up the resources around us but we're thinking of time as a resource to use well then again it becomes something we have to do i wouldn't have written this book if i wasn't willing to instrumentalize time in a certain in a certain sense and nobody would ever get anything done in their in their professional lives if they didn't so i'm really talking about a kind of over investment in that stance a sense that i think is driven especially by the economic system that we live in and the stage that that's at now excuse me where it becomes the only form of value it all too easily that sort of instrumental mindset just sort of forces everything else out so so in other words you come to think about every moment of time only or pretty much only in terms of its value for some future moment of time and that when it's taken to that absolute place that that clearly is self-defeating and an irrational and and unfortunate uh way to be because it's um you know by definition you're going to you're placing the val the whole value of life constantly uh at some point that is not now and it only ever is now so you're never going to kind of cash out the value of life and find value in the moment so i think it's about sort of having the ability to take both of those perspectives it's certainly i don't recommend and i certainly have never retained myself the ability to care only about this precise moment um and not where it's leading but i think that you know over investment in that we see the effects of that all around us in sort of sapping the meaning from people's lives like what is this all for because they're aware on some level that what it's all for when they get to the time when it's supposedly all four it'll all still be for something in the future from then as well and and so on it felt like trying to find the fun in the moment and perhaps we you think about childhood where you know nursery leads to reception reception leads to this year and you know you're then working towards university and university more than job is for retirement and at which point is yeah at what point are you sort of having fun in the in the moment right right um perhaps you could um you talk about you know within within our con how we work with time and what we think about it um rediscovering rest and hobbies for the sake of it and perhaps you know when we think about having more fun do do we do enough things enough activities which we only do for their own sake you just moved to yorkshire where you probably have more opportunities to go for a walk in the in the in the countryside yeah i'm really i'm having a walk yeah i'm really putting my claims to the test here because i've got no excuse left anymore not to spend a significant chunk of my time hiking on the north york moors and uh so if i don't then i really am condemned uh as a as a failure of uh embracing the moment so we shall see i've been here two weeks i've been on a couple of hikes um i'll report back later um i think that um you know this instrumental this exclusive focus on the instrumental use of time uh is sort of at its most ironic in the context of leisure because like it's if you're even treating your leisure as a means to an end solely as a means to an end then like what what's left the the certainly the sort of ancient greek speaking broadly conception of leisure was that it was the the goal of everything else so you maybe had to work um and you maybe had to do all sorts of things but but but the reason you were doing them all was so that you could get the time the leisure time that was that was sort of life uh in its highest expression which admittedly for ancient philosophers tends to mean what you should do with that time is like philosophy they were that was a so that's not this doesn't necessarily follow but so i'm sort of making the case in the book for something that the the contemporary philosopher kieran satya has described as atylic activities things that you do not because of what they're leading up to or amounting to that are not defined by some kind of end point hiking is a fun example um just because um you know anyone who has any experience of enjoying a walk in the country knows you you probably drive the car to a car park somewhere and then you either go in a loop back to the car or you walk you know a few miles to a to an extreme point and turn around and come back if you wanted to do either of those things most efficiently the simplest way would just be not to go on the hike in the first place um all you're doing is getting getting back to where you started now there are instrumental benefits you know there are you can it's a it's good for your physical fitness uh you um might be like recording your route on all these social um apps for for you know now that enable you to share your um the views that you're gazing out over but basically you hike to hike and as cetera says you know there's not going to become a you're not going to get to a point in your life where you think um okay i've done all the hiking i'd aim to do that job is complete you are going to stop but you're not going to stop because you've reached the end of a project or exhausted an activity you're just going to stop because eventually you will or your interest might change or you may be too old and frail to continue or any number of things and that kind of i think that's i think that's what the the i think that's what is crystallized in the idea of a hobby and i think it's probably why the idea of a hobby feels a little bit cringe and embarrassing in the modern world right unlike as i say but unlike side hustles which are hobbies that have a very clear instrumental value that you're going to make money out of them and they are they are cool and hip and and it's good to have a side hustle it's kind of embarrassing to have a hobby and i think that that is at least in part because they don't fit and they are sort of culturally subversive in a way uh they don't they don't fit into this idea that everything has got to be for something else and quite possibly that something else is is financial profit but not necessarily it's just it's all for something other than itself and that's not true of uh you know of going on a hike um yeah so yeah that's that's that's very cool um i've written on my notes here um painting staring which uh i've not i've not yet had the time to go and find three hours to do this but perhaps you could talk about i've i've i haven't got the the name of the lady who suggested doing it but perhaps you could talk about that and what you found in in taking three hours out of the data stairs painting yeah totally i mean this is this is the part of the book where i'm writing about patience and impatience and i think that um one way to understand the feeling of impatience that is that is uh you know as ubiquitous today as ever it's another example of the way we rail against our limitation right and in that case it's the limitation of how fast we can force the rest of the world to to go um [Music] and this idea that certain activities just take the time they take and and sort of dictate their own speed and we just have to if we want to get the benefit of them we just have to fit around that instead of trying to constantly uh accelerate them up to the level where we would feel like we were the ones in control of them there's a art historian at harvard called uh jennifer roberts who um asks all her incoming students to do this exercise where they have to select a painting or a sculpture in the cambridge boston area and go and look at it for three hours straight um [Music] i think they're allowed to take bathroom breaks but that's it right it's just you just you you you sit there stand there i think you know folding chairs are useful here and um i looked at three hours and the point is you know she knows that's a crazily long amount of time but she knows that how people react to that her insight is that um it's very easy to think that you've seen a painting just because you've looked at it for a couple of seconds uh and that the tempo of life that her students are exposed to today through technology through the hyper-competitive atmosphere at universities like harvard and all the rest of it is such that like she needs to play a role as a teacher in deliberately making the tempo be much much much much slower to sort of make them go through the discomfort of staying in that one place to the point where you you can then see things you know i mean you really do see things in a painting if you look for that sort of absurdly long amount of time and i went to do this i went to meet her harvard and i sat at in the harvard art museums and did a and looked at a painting by uh dagar uh for three hours taking notes that's loud um and you know i spent the first half hour thinking i'd totally chosen the wrong painting i should have chosen something with more to look at which was just a manifestation of the impatience right and you go through then another hour of sort of all kinds of fidgety awful discomfort but on the other side of that you i genuinely did literally see things in this painting uh that i hadn't seen until then uh i'm not i'm not using c metaphorically to mean like i had thoughts about what it could mean i literally saw shadows and facial expressions and lines that seemed to suggest areas of space that i hadn't previously seen it's extraordinary and um it's just a sort of slightly extreme example of the benefit of letting something that you're engaged with take its time i think a more day-to-day example uh stop me if you want to be on something else but more day-to-day example of this is just like reading especially kind of reading fiction people me particularly right people say these days that they don't they can't find time to read that's a very common complaint and i think it's true to some extent but mainly i don't think people mean that they don't have a half hour in a 24-hour period when they could read a book some people are that busy but i think a lot of us are not it's that when we find that half hour and sit down with say a novel we don't we're too sort of um amped up and to running too fast to to slow down to the speed that reading a novel or reading a lot of non-fiction books too um requires so your sort of the flywheel is turning so fast that it feels really unpleasant to to slow it down so naturally you know people want to read summaries and synopsis or find techniques of speed reading to to bring reading up to the speed of of the the rest of life um and i think those do have some benefits for just sort of sheer information absorption but the real experience of reading a good book is just one that like there's a little amount of acceleration you can you can bring to it but beyond that it's just it just takes the time it takes it's given by the book the speed right it's not given by you you don't get to um dictate how fast it goes i guess just finally on this topic i always think it's so fascinating how as technology has made has caused it to take much much much less time to to do things that previously took a long time uh we actually get more and more impatient rather than less impatient yeah why is it so much more frustrating to wait eight seconds for a really badly slow loading web page than like three days to be sent some information in the mail it's like it shouldn't be that way we should be like feeling so relaxed and expansive about how much time we have and the idea i explore in the book is that part of what's going on here is just that we have now thanks to uh technological developments got to the point where it really does feel like we are almost able to do everything we want instantaneously almost able to cook our food in zero seconds flat because it only takes two minutes in the microwave almost able to find any information that we want uh you know with without any perceptible time delay and so in that situation of feeling like you are very nearly uh god it's way more frustrating to run up against the remaining ways in which you aren't you know the the fact that novels still take time to consume the fact that there are some slow loading web pages the fact that it does take two whole minutes uh to heat some food in the microwave instead of zero um if you work in an office with a microwave it's always been cancelled out at like seven seconds because i'm sure people tell themselves because their food was ready but actually i think it's because they're just like they couldn't wait they couldn't bear it anymore and that's the moment at which they were like ah screw this i'm just gonna take the food out because i cannot bring myself to wait these seconds it's really you know i i this is totally anecdotal but i think that people get um more impatient and angrier in in traffic in road traffic now that so much of our life is lived on smartphones operating at broadband speeds because i feel like it the contrast between uh so much of what we can do and the material obstacles of the cars in front just gets more and more pronounced and enraging i wondered if the pandemic had in any way exasperated that because we now do even more online when we're used to food being delivered as and when we want it that when we interact with the physical world yeah those frustrations i don't know a year of living inside i think has to an extent made us even more unaccepting of the slowness of the real world um could be yeah i don't know that and i think there are also advanced i think there are also things we see afresh and appreciate and value about the concrete material world as a result of the time you know the time in the pandemic but yeah it's certainly plausible definitely yeah uh if you have any questions uh whilst watching please add them in the in the chat window um we'll get to those after i've spoken uh asked you about well let's say that we have um embraced our finitude and we've decided which big rocks we want to put into our jar what are some tips that you would give us to start embracing this lifestyle what can we what can we actively do now to kind of to to be better at this it's a really good question yeah you should end the book you speak about yes it's a really good question i am a little bit conflicted about answering it because i do think that ultimately this is about a shift in perspective it is about seeing things differently i don't mean that i expect people to sort of read my book and have a sort of instant spiritual enlightenment experience i it can be a small perspective shift i think it is a so i think it is mainly about sort of feeling your way into this limit embracing mindset and what you find then sometimes is that it's really obvious what techniques or methods you should use to implement that or take one thing i've found for example is that you know productivity techniques i experimented with years ago but did so then in the spirit of trying to become the perfect controller of my time they're perfectly useful ways to organize the day now but i'm holding them much more loosely as a result of having felt my way somewhat into this this different mindset that said i definitely think there are some approaches to organizing work and life for example that that make more sense and that go with this mindset more than more than others one whole set of them is any kind of technique or approach to work that focuses on sort of serializing on sequent or making big projects sequential on getting closer to that state of doing one thing at a time whether that's literally on the level of the individual task or on the level of major projects sort of making most of them cue and line up behind one that you're focusing on now and moving it through and finishing it so the kanban approach to workflow management that i'm sure many people be familiar with uh there's a there's a great book called personal kanban by um jim benson and tony anne barry about applying this uh kind of that kind of approach which is obviously a team approach to your individual workflow there are lots of other ways i give a very simple one in the book about well let me stop and pause the point is all these things having progress all these things have in common is that they limit your work in progress they say okay here are the 40 things that feel like they matter and here are the three or so that i'm going to give my attention to and i'm not going to move on to the others until at least one of those three is is completed so you sort of bring yourself to live with the anxiety of knowing that all these other things are going uncompleted in order to bring something uh to completion and then just quickly you know i think i think all sort of time boxing and time blocking approaches can be well adapted to this to this mindset if you say i'm going to try to ring fence two or three hours of the morning for um sort of focused work that really matters to me and i'm going to try to limit my email processing time to an hour and a half towards the end of the day in both those cases what you're saying is you're not saying i'm going to finish this project today or i'm going to get to the bottom of my email today you're going time first you're saying i'm going to dedicate this amount of time to it i'm going to stop at the end of that time that's kind of a way of thinking about your schedule that really respects the finitude of your time instead of one that goes tasks first and says i've got to get through this whole list come what may and then you find you know that you're still at your desk at 11 p.m and the list just got twice as long during the course of day anyway i think you've actually if we can bring up julie julie's question i think you've actually kind of answered this uh so based on oliver's thoughts on the negativity of distraction i'm curious to hear his take on multitasking and how we can do it in a more time efficient manner i feel like you're saying don't do multitasking yeah i mean it's a little there's a there's some there are some subtleties here there are there's research that show you know certain forms of multitasking with using different kinds of attentional channels and stuff can be that can work i don't tell people they shouldn't listen to a podcast while they're doing the vacuuming or something you can you can combine tasks meaningfully in that way when it comes to our sort of focused focused attention on on sort of mentally taxing tasks um you basically just can't multitask anyway and if you think that you are doing what you're really doing is rapidly switching between things between keeping half an eye on your email inbox and a piece of writing you're trying to do say and calling it multitasking and i think that generally what happens there i think there are personality differences i don't want to tell people they definitely should never do it but generally what happens there if you have um you know three or four or five potential destinations for your attention at any moment is that as soon as any one of them gets difficult or challenging you just bounce off to one that's a bit easier and i think this probably especially happens more on the level of projects as opposed to tasks in other words to some degree manage your moment-to-moment tasks how you like but if you are really telling yourself that say in my case it could be three articles that i really care about if i'm really telling myself that all of those three are going to be kind of moved forward roughly at the same time or during the same period of time all that happens is that the moment one of them becomes difficult because guess what meaningful and important things feel difficult and uncomfortable you just move to the other one so you add you end up managing to make no progress on them because you're just sort of escaping the difficulty at each point so um you know it's not that you can't ever combine tasks or don't ever need to keep an eye on some on your email while doing something else but that like if you see what's going on there and you become more conscious of it you're much more likely to be able to avoid this situation of like not really doing anything because what you're actually doing in those contexts is pursuing the emotional feeling of being in control taking care of business having fingers in pies uh at the expense of getting things done that that you care about brilliant look let's take peter's question is this the midlife crisis book like this do you need to have changed extreme do you need to have chased extreme productivity first and having achieved common life goals family career financial to begin seeking a new perspective on time it's such a good question there's two interpretations of it right is it is this did this book emerge from my having a midlife crisis probably in some sense and then is it only useful for people who are at that stage and i i tried very consciously in in writing this book to not make it a book that was only uh beneficial to people who'd sort of exhausted all those techniques or perhaps what i mean is to point out certain truths about how those techniques work that might um that might accelerate uh a sort of profitable kind of crisis in someone who is uh you know uh in their 30s or their late 20s rather than in their 40s like me um i think there's some truth to this right i think that that that one of the easiest ways to uh understand the limitations of this kind of uh limit denying approach to life is to pursue it very energetically for a number of years and exhaust it and and realize that a different method is is required and i also think that many of the sort of things that people achieve in the first half of adulthood um which is often things like you know establishing themselves in a career separating off from their family of origin and being part of a of their own family um you know these things are can be done with and perhaps even sometimes catalyzed by a sort of unrealistic belief in the degree of your control over your life i guess i i guess i just end up by saying that i don't think it is ever um unhelpful to to see how reality is when it comes to time when it comes to our limitations i don't think it's something that you can only understand at a certain point in life and i don't think it's something that um that it's beneficial to sort of have kept from it to have kept from you as an earlier stage of life you know i'll be honest i think it would be i would be surprised if there were sort of 16 17 year olds who who thought that this book spoke to them i would be very gratified but i think it probably is something that comes from i also think that the age at which people encounter the sort of impossible demands of the world that we've created is clearly getting lower right the age of which people say the wage in which people complain about burnout i mean this is that burnout is a thing that people encounter in their 20s now judging by all sorts of reports and books and studies um not something that you have to have got into your sort of mid 50s uh before you've before you're sort of exhausted enough to encounter it so i think that hopefully the relevance of this the age at which this book is relevant to people is is falling as the uh as the world gets uh more and more insane with respect to timing the pace of acceleration is accelerating is healthy let's take mario's tour mario's question uh thanks to the talk my question is about attention span uh is there any reliable evidence on shortened attention spans as patients in the modern world uh is it real or is it a myth did you do any research on on this attention span is a really weird concept it's a very good question attention span is a really weird concept that i um have tried to understand and don't write about in the book because it just seems extremely uh it it sort of falls apart on on closer in inspection patience i think there's good reason to believe um that um that we sort of tolerate shorter and shorter amounts of time that it takes to do things or to have information communicated to us there's all sorts of fascinating longitudinal research on like the the length of edits in movies and the length of political speeches and uh sort of things like that that at least seem to be responding to a desire for um shorter and shorter bits of focus um i think that yeah i don't i i don't think that it's the most useful way to think about what's happening to our attention to think about that we are um less and less able to focus for extended periods of time i think it is probably more helpful and certainly more clearly true anyway that we are more and more tempted to abandon those focused periods of time and that there are more and more services and devices only too willing to you know use cutting-edge technology to keep us distracted once we have left those uh those that that focus for for distraction so it's in a way you're talking about attention span there but in a way you're talking about the sense that there are other possibilities and if you find yourself in a hut on a mountainside with no internet access and nothing to do but write your novel you're more likely to write your novel not because you've suddenly developed a long attention span but because um alternatives have been taken away from you the the sort of tormenting choice of other options is gone for a while yeah i find when i really need to get something done i will leave my phone and laptop home and take a notepad and a pen to a coffee shop and that's that i can't do anything else except yeah get through that yeah uh i'd love to know um how are you thinking about teaching this to your you have a son how are you thinking about teaching this how can we how can we what should we be teaching our children about this this concept such an interesting question and i don't feel like he's four turning five so i still really don't feel like i know what i'm doing when it comes to parenting and also he keeps getting older and changing so what anything i do learn becomes out of date um i you know i have been sort of fascinated and slightly dismayed just they obviously everyone says it's about kids right they reflect your your own personality back to you in ways that are often uncomfortable you know that when he started to sort of ask what we were doing next what we're doing next and trying to like get a schedule for the day into his head i was like oh my god i've really totally inculcated productivity geekhood uh into him and i'm hoping that uh you know i i think i see that being out here in uh more spending more time in nature is is something that sort of seeps into his uh bones i tell you what i think is the the most sort of uh daunting lesson that i have learned about inculcating lessons i guess is that uh you really have to do it yourself if you want the kid to do it too in other words you if you want to be if you want your child to grow up to be someone who isn't checking their phone every three seconds you have to not check your phone every three seconds and even more weirdly i think it's true that you have to not be i mean he doesn't have a phone but you know what i mean he's already he you know he's he's very interested by screens that are in the house and that's fine but i don't want him to be completely fixated by them not only do you have to be better at yourself in their presence but you sort of have to genuinely live it in your whole life even when they're in bed it's a really strange kind of uh almost kind of uh paranormal phenomenon or something right that like um you can't just uh put them to bed and then for two hours become a completely scattered uh terrible user of time or or something like that if you really want to model those lessons so that's what i'm sort of grappling with i don't want to make it sound entirely to do with screens that's just sort of everyone's always worrying about that so much but like to be present in the moment like i feel like the very best thing i can do is to be better at that and do you think do you think writing the book as a self-confessed um time management do you think writing the book has helped you become better at you know yeah no definitely i think lots of people sometimes assume the way books get written is you sort of have a great insight and then you set it down in in writing but for me the experience of the writing this book was that i did sort of have to as i discovered what i thought about time through writing it i did have to sort of become more of that become more of that person uh partly it's just accountability right i mean if i'm going to give some talk somewhere and someone spots me like impatiently freaking out about how like long the microwave is taking then i'm kind of it's pretty embarrassing but but more generally and more authentically you know it's just like no i i understand intellectually a huge number of things to be true now about time that i previously didn't and then the long haul is kind of living into those uh intellectual realizations and i've and i've done it somewhat and i've got a long way to go wonderful well oliver thank you so much for joining us today it's been it's been genuinely insightful i can't recommend the book enough available in audio you said you've done the audio book as well so yes that's available uh i have not done one of these talks and and put as many post-it notes inside it um as ever uh so yeah genuinely recommend uh is a great read for everyone a good use of one of your four thousand weeks i think was a quote i've stolen from another review online um thank you so on behalf of everyone watching now and in the future thank you so much for joining us hopefully one day for your next book you can join us in the office i will be delightful um otherwise oliver thank you so much for joining us today thank you it's been a pleasure i really enjoyed it and great questions thank you thank you [Music]

by oliver berkman author of 4 000 weeks time and how to use it uh oliver is the author of the antidote happiness for people who can't stand positive thinking and for many years wrote a popular weekly column on psychology for the guardian this column will change your life here's a devoted following for his writing on productivity mortality the power of limits and be building a meaningful life in an age of bewilderment uh please join me in thanking oliver for joining us today oliver hi thanks very much for inviting me this is great thank you so much for coming uh well look i am genuinely excited about talking to you uh three four four thousand weeks uh i i i've so many questions so many thoughts about it perhaps you could start by telling us what does four thousand weeks represent why why the why the title of the book so four thousand weeks is extremely approximately the average human lifespan in the west expressed in terms of weeks if you live to be 80 you'll have had a few more than that as i'm sure people can figure out it's pretty straightforward mental arithmetic but it's um i i completely rounded it to a uh to a sort of punchy round number it's it's it's basically how much we can reasonably expect to get to to get to play with in terms it feels like a very small number when represented in which indeed even those who live to be a hundred it's the order of six thousand weeks it's not it's not it's not a lot right no there's something very interesting about weeks because if you express it in days well it's it's a very large number if you press it in years it's very small but we get the scent we have the feeling that a year lasts goes on forever so it doesn't really matter it's that it's that middle zone where you're expressing it in a relatively small number of a quantity that nonetheless we feel is very brief and irrelevant in the course of our lives it doesn't seem like if you waste a week of your life it ought to matter yeah that's very cool um so the book broadly uh speaks about um how do we choose what we choose so that's we can kind of touch upon some of those those subjects um you open by talking about um acknowledging and embracing the the limit embracing life and how time has perhaps had a different meaning to people over the ages perhaps you could talk about that um and how we think about time now yeah sure i mean i think par part of what i find myself doing in talking about this book is is sort of deflecting a potential interpretation of that title i mean i'm glad i've we gave this book an attention grabbing title but there's a misinterpretation i think which would be like okay this is time is incredibly short therefore the only way to make the most use of of it is to live in a kind of white knuckle um very self-conscious and and strenuous attempt to sort of eke the most out of every day and you know do extreme sports every weekend and uh and uh you know never never lose a second and i think that actually what i'm trying to get at here is that there's a huge amount of relief as well as energy and motivation and focus that comes from acknowledging how limited we are with respect to time and thus seeing all the different ways in which we can talk about this i'm sure you know especially in kind of productivity culture and time management but not only all the ways in which we we we proceed as if we might find a way to fit everything in we might find a way to become so efficient as to not have to encounter the the ramifications of being finite so it's really about a sort of dropping back down to the ground and uh making time for a handful of things that really matter and giving up this impossible struggle to sort of uh be infinite with respect to time as opposed to this kind of very exhausting and rather stressful kind of carpe diem approach which you do see in popular culture which i think ultimately is actually just another form of the of the attitude that i'm uh criticizing uh in the book to go even further into sort of unseating our conventional views of time yes you're right i think there's lots of good evidence that the example i hear in the book is english medieval peasants although i think it would also apply to many different cultures at different times in history perhaps also to some indigenous cultures today that this whole notion of time as something separate from you time is as a resource that you have to use well or that you could be guilty of wasting or that you need to sort of save through efficiency techniques the whole conceptual basis of that distinction uh i think we can confidently say just wouldn't have occurred to a kind of working class laborer in early medieval england right um time for for them and for many other people it would have followed the patterns that anthropologists call task orientation right so instead of thinking about your activities as lined up against a schedule or a timeline or a calendar or something it's the tasks themselves that would have given the rhythm to the day time would have just been the medium in which your life unfolded rather than something that you could sort of psychologically objectify and then be tormented by or try to dominate or feel hounded by and you know the productivity guru who had gone up to a medieval farmer and said like why don't you uh do all the milking for the month uh all in one day to get it out of the way because batching your tasks is a really great way to to get more things done i mean obviously that would have been lunacy and still today it's essentially you know lunacy as an approach to milking cows because those things just need doing when they need doing and crops need harvesting when they need harvesting and you know i think we all or many of us have some experience of this kind of time i think that one very obvious example is in the first few months with a newborn baby but i think that you don't have to be a parent to have been in places where that kind of sense of the schedule the sense of the timetable falls away and you're just sort of in time uh it has its disadvantages because you you can't build a sort of industrial technologically advanced society without without um that objectified idea of time but it has some big advantages as well which are a kind of peace of mind that i think is a lot harder for us to access uh today it was um you spoke about when you um time used to be measured in how long it takes to do a task so having to take instead of just using a minute or an hour you'd say all the time it takes to bring in the hair or milk the cat bring the hair milk out it actually made me think of i have a i have a five-year-old daughter and we measure time in the length of her favorite tv shows like how long would it take to get to this bus stop well at the time it takes to watch two of these shows so actually for children who don't understand minutes and hours we still use task based times i thought was quite interesting yeah no it's fascinating and even that kind of comparison like i don't think that would have been the normal way of talking my understanding of the literature is it wouldn't have been a normal way of talking about time it's just that when you had to do some comparing like there wasn't the widespread notion there wasn't the white there wasn't a sort of um widespread adoption of clocks or of time measuring devices among ordinary people so yeah you just have to grasp for some other for some other task as a as a comparator and you know people tend to think that life moved more slowly back then as another example of this but i think that probably that concept of life moving slowly would have been the thing that didn't make sense if you sort of time travel back to medieval england it's not that life moved more slowly but just like what slowly as compared to watch i mean it's just life it's just unfolding it's only a sort of post-industrialization that it is ubiquitous uh to think about life unfolding according to something that isn't life uh a time a timeline or a yardstick um you get it in ancient greece and rome like you get all sorts of things but it's that's a that's a new thing for for almost everybody in the world to be um thinking as a way of governing their lives and perhaps post internet we not only compare ourselves to how much we can family today but how much others are able or seem to be able to cram into a day and so the question of oh how do i do all of the things it's not just all of those those those big rocks that i want to accomplish but that others seem to be doing which i think uh perhaps you could talk about your dislike of the big rocks parable which for those i imagine that many those dudes but for those who don't know it's the it's it's how do you fit the big rocks the small box and the sand into a jar the idea being you have to put the big rocks in first and then the smaller things can fit around those but you dislike that for a very good reason well this is a metaphor for prioritization and it says you know if you want to have time to do everything that counts just make sure you make time first for the things that that really matter um yeah i mean i i think there is some wisdom in here but but the my basic objection is that this is a this is a rigged experiment the uh the person in the in the parable who is bringing these rocks and pebbles and sand into the classroom or seminar room or whether it's supposed to happen has only brought enough rocks uh that he knows in advance will will fit into the jar um and i don't think that our primary problem on the level of individual time management today is that we prioritize things badly although we do i think it is that there are too many big rocks there are too many things that genuinely matter and you know if we had 40 hours in a day we could still fill that time with things that genuinely matter it it isn't that if you find the right tricks and techniques you'll be able to get rid of only all the unimportant tedious stuff and then spend your life in this kind of unfolding of just pure meaningfulness and feel like you're doing everything it's like no you're gonna have to not do lots of things that do matter uh in order to make time for the things that you that you care about the most out of those out of those things let's talk about the efficiency traps so you talk about uh the the curse perhaps of clearing the decks we all come in and i've seen people block out the first hour of their calendars to clear emails you talk about how that actually creates more work right i mean this is something that i'm sure a number of people watching will be familiar with in in other contexts right this general idea which crops up as all sorts of other paradoxes the jevons paradox in in energy efficiency and a bunch of others but if you make a system more efficient without regard to any other governing value you just pursue greater efficiency in processing things through the system then all else being equal the system will fill with more and more stuff rather than bringing peace of mind and will or um or like empty time or capacity and it will um fill with with more and more junk rather than uh good stuff so applied to time management the idea here is you know if you get incredibly good at processing your email all else being equal what will happen is you'll just get more email uh because you'll reply to people and they'll reply to you and those replies will generate replies and they'll go forever you get a reputation for being responsive to email so more people will reach out to email you and just in general email unless it's stopped by some other act on your part email will just come to dominate your life more and more in direct contradiction to your motive initial motivation to uh to sort of bring email under control this is you know this is parkinson's law work expands to fill the time available for its completion um it's that thing where they widen motorways to relieve traffic congestion and it makes the uh it provides an added incentive for more drivers to use that route and so the the congestion sort of tends gradually back towards where it originally was so when i'm talking about the efficiency trap i'm talking about a thing which i think is encouraged by a lot of sort of less good productivity advice and productivity culture which is this idea that there is some inherent benefit in just getting more efficient at doing more things in a smaller amount of time firstly there's no benefit in doing things per se unless they're the good the right things to do and then secondly yeah you get into this problem where where um the more stuff that comes across your radar the the more likely you are to accept additional things to do that actually aren't worth your time because none of these incoming things will have to meet this um filter or me sort of get over this hurdle of is this worth sacrificing something else for because you've convinced yourself that you're gonna have time for for everything when i was working as a journalist on a sort of day-to-day as a feature writer at the guardian um yeah the the better i got at doing stuff the more more efficient i got at doing stuff the the more i began to realize what i was really good at was doing stuff that didn't matter and that the things that i really cared about would just get endlessly postponed while i told myself yeah i was clearing the decks which was your original question and we could talk more about that but anyway i'll stop there for now no that's really cool um and i certainly know when when i clear the decks i actually get a little um like an endorphin rush for having done something like that the element of completeness but um and i don't want to perhaps address the more difficult task um but let's talk about um you talk about finitude and pronounce that correctly uh which which i've sort of summarized is acknowledging our mortality which sounds very a bit bleak but actually when you when you accept that and think about it it can be liberating perhaps you could talk about that concept you've you've coined i mean i didn't invent the word finitude people have people do wonder about how to pronounce it all i can say is in the audiobook for this i say finitude a lot so i really i really hope that's the right uh the right pronunciation i i just mean yes i this is a consequence of the fact that we die but i don't think that this book is really about you know it's not really about death and dying and mortality and that kind of very melodramatic kind of and very difficult uh aspect of human existence it's not about suggesting that anyone can sort of completely confront their mortality i don't think i certainly don't think i have um but rather the fact that our time is limited and that we are sort of material creatures in limited time with limited energy and limited attentional bandwidth and and all the rest of it the consequence of this i'm sort of wrapping up in this word finitude to refer to the state of being limited and therefore having to make by definition you know trade-offs and to exist in a world of opportunity costs and having to make tough decisions not being able to do all the things that we are you know psychologically able to think about and imagine not being able to meet all the demands that society might throw at us there's just no reason to assume that if we can think of something or somebody can ask something of us uh that there's capacity for it in a in a human in a human life uh uh beyond a certain point there won't be and uh these kind of sacrifices will just be be built into the situation so i think what i'm saying for a big chunk of the book is that like this is such an uncomfortable feeling that we pursue all sorts of uh ultimately counterproductive activities to sort of engage in emotional avoidance to feel like we're limitless when we're not i think that a lot of uh distraction is is based on is rooted in that we could talk about that if you like and i think a lot of time management stuff and certainly the years i spent as a sort of weirdo productivity geek um still am a little bit but you know recovering maybe they were it was about trying to achieve a kind of control over my time and my projects and my work in my life that would you know that subliminally would enable you not to have me not to have to confront this i think situation yeah you do you define distraction is motivated by the desire to try to flee something painful about our experience with the present which i quite which i quite liked and um we think about um well perhaps we could talk about the attention economy and how that feeds kind of our desire to be distracted and sort of be feel like we're achieving something whereas actually we're not achieving anything sure i mean i i don't know the individual details of people watching this but i don't feel that any of you are likely to need a sort of basic introduction to the idea of of the attention economy what i'm what i'm trying to explore in the book is well two points really firstly how the firstly that attention is so fundamental to the experience of life that calling it a resource like a limited resource people talk about it is almost uh a misnomer you know it's it there's a sense in which attention just is life and and what you pay attention to over the course of your life will sum up to what your life will have been so it's an incredibly uh serious thing to be involved with either as a user of technology or as or as someone working in uh digital technology but also secondly this thing that i don't think gets us enough attention which is you know i have many many criticisms of social media platforms and algorithmically driven you know attention mining effectively but but we talk a lot as if this is a sort of force that we i mean if you if you read a lot of stuff or you watch you know the social dilemma et cetera you you might be left with the impression that the the typical moment of digital distraction is one in which you know i'm sort of working away on a piece of writing and i'm feeling thrilled by it and it's so wonderful and i'm really enjoying myself and then um like somehow the the evil tendrils of silicon valley come and sort of grab me unwillingly away from my from my work and i do think that some of the tendrils of silicon valley are evil and that we should talk critically about them but that's not what happens what happens is i'm finding the work unpleasant or intimidating or boring or difficult and i am thrilled by the opportunity to go and scroll through down my phone for a bit instead and do something to leave or to leave aside something that i thought was what really mattered to me and go and do something that by definition if it's distraction like doesn't matter to me yeah and so i'm looking in the book at the idea that basically what's going on here is that that um you know it's not a coincidence that things that matter to us induce discomfort um they bring us up against the limits of our capacities and our ability to control how time unfolds you're writing a chapter of your novel you don't know that it's going to go well you don't know you've got what it takes you don't know that people will receive it well it might be forgotten or ignored or mocked you want to have an important difficult conversation with your spouse you don't know how it's going to unfold it might leave you feeling emotionally emotionally vulnerable it might lead to an angry exchange you know you can't you don't have that control it's precisely because these things matter that they evoke these uncomfortable feelings and then i think it feels absolutely wonderful to do something uh less important instead and to sort of zone out and i think the phenomenology of the internet is a super interesting part of this because actually these days we've always been distractible for these reasons but these days not only samuel johnson wrote about it but not only do we have reason to flee the stuff we care about because of discomfort but we have a place to go when we're fleeing it that phenomenologically speaking does feel kind of limitless it does feel like um a a realm where limits don't apply where you can portray yourself how you like find out about things that are happening thousands and thousands of miles away in virtually no time at all um it's very seductive as a as a as a way not to confront the the sort of limitations of being a human creature in time but i do think that ultimately it's only by confronting some of those limitations that we that we make progress on the things that we that we care about so it's uh getting finding some way to tolerate or accommodate or get friendly with that discomfort i think is a pretty much a superpower when it comes to thriving in the modern world no no i certainly struggle that i know every time i delete myself on purpose forget my password for social media i get distracted by the news or putting on the radio or something something else um well the second half of your book uh really speaks about the concept of time and how we how we define it and how we think about it i thought i might just read a small section which really spoke to me at the beginning of chapter eight sure um there's another sense in which treating time is something that we own and get to control seems to make life worse inevitably we become obsessed with using it well whereupon we discover an unfortunate truth the more you focus on using time well the more each day begins to feel like something you have to get through on route to some karma better more fulfilling point in the future which never actually arrives this this future chasing or i think you call it like the when i finally view of ourselves i mean is it is that just part of the human condition is that something we can we can acknowledge i know i know i'm always sort of doing something to get to the next stage um how do you how how have you thought about that and how we can for one of a better phrase live more in the moment yeah such a big question we can come to that because i i have thoughts about that but um yeah i think that um i i don't i think that an instrumental approach to experience right to using to to doing things now for some future gain is absolutely sort of you know as old as humanity nothing would ever get done if people couldn't sort of persevere to to do things and building civilization would never have would never have happened i think then once we all enter into this very instrumentalized notion of time that we were talking about at the beginning where we're all trying to use not only up the resources around us but we're thinking of time as a resource to use well then again it becomes something we have to do i wouldn't have written this book if i wasn't willing to instrumentalize time in a certain in a certain sense and nobody would ever get anything done in their in their professional lives if they didn't so i'm really talking about a kind of over investment in that stance a sense that i think is driven especially by the economic system that we live in and the stage that that's at now excuse me where it becomes the only form of value it all too easily that sort of instrumental mindset just sort of forces everything else out so so in other words you come to think about every moment of time only or pretty much only in terms of its value for some future moment of time and that when it's taken to that absolute place that that clearly is self-defeating and an irrational and and unfortunate uh way to be because it's um you know by definition you're going to you're placing the val the whole value of life constantly uh at some point that is not now and it only ever is now so you're never going to kind of cash out the value of life and find value in the moment so i think it's about sort of having the ability to take both of those perspectives it's certainly i don't recommend and i certainly have never retained myself the ability to care only about this precise moment um and not where it's leading but i think that you know over investment in that we see the effects of that all around us in sort of sapping the meaning from people's lives like what is this all for because they're aware on some level that what it's all for when they get to the time when it's supposedly all four it'll all still be for something in the future from then as well and and so on it felt like trying to find the fun in the moment and perhaps we you think about childhood where you know nursery leads to reception reception leads to this year and you know you're then working towards university and university more than job is for retirement and at which point is yeah at what point are you sort of having fun in the in the moment right right um perhaps you could um you talk about you know within within our con how we work with time and what we think about it um rediscovering rest and hobbies for the sake of it and perhaps you know when we think about having more fun do do we do enough things enough activities which we only do for their own sake you just moved to yorkshire where you probably have more opportunities to go for a walk in the in the in the countryside yeah i'm really i'm having a walk yeah i'm really putting my claims to the test here because i've got no excuse left anymore not to spend a significant chunk of my time hiking on the north york moors and uh so if i don't then i really am condemned uh as a as a failure of uh embracing the moment so we shall see i've been here two weeks i've been on a couple of hikes um i'll report back later um i think that um you know this instrumental this exclusive focus on the instrumental use of time uh is sort of at its most ironic in the context of leisure because like it's if you're even treating your leisure as a means to an end solely as a means to an end then like what what's left the the certainly the sort of ancient greek speaking broadly conception of leisure was that it was the the goal of everything else so you maybe had to work um and you maybe had to do all sorts of things but but but the reason you were doing them all was so that you could get the time the leisure time that was that was sort of life uh in its highest expression which admittedly for ancient philosophers tends to mean what you should do with that time is like philosophy they were that was a so that's not this doesn't necessarily follow but so i'm sort of making the case in the book for something that the the contemporary philosopher kieran satya has described as atylic activities things that you do not because of what they're leading up to or amounting to that are not defined by some kind of end point hiking is a fun example um just because um you know anyone who has any experience of enjoying a walk in the country knows you you probably drive the car to a car park somewhere and then you either go in a loop back to the car or you walk you know a few miles to a to an extreme point and turn around and come back if you wanted to do either of those things most efficiently the simplest way would just be not to go on the hike in the first place um all you're doing is getting getting back to where you started now there are instrumental benefits you know there are you can it's a it's good for your physical fitness uh you um might be like recording your route on all these social um apps for for you know now that enable you to share your um the views that you're gazing out over but basically you hike to hike and as cetera says you know there's not going to become a you're not going to get to a point in your life where you think um okay i've done all the hiking i'd aim to do that job is complete you are going to stop but you're not going to stop because you've reached the end of a project or exhausted an activity you're just going to stop because eventually you will or your interest might change or you may be too old and frail to continue or any number of things and that kind of i think that's i think that's what the the i think that's what is crystallized in the idea of a hobby and i think it's probably why the idea of a hobby feels a little bit cringe and embarrassing in the modern world right unlike as i say but unlike side hustles which are hobbies that have a very clear instrumental value that you're going to make money out of them and they are they are cool and hip and and it's good to have a side hustle it's kind of embarrassing to have a hobby and i think that that is at least in part because they don't fit and they are sort of culturally subversive in a way uh they don't they don't fit into this idea that everything has got to be for something else and quite possibly that something else is is financial profit but not necessarily it's just it's all for something other than itself and that's not true of uh you know of going on a hike um yeah so yeah that's that's that's very cool um i've written on my notes here um painting staring which uh i've not i've not yet had the time to go and find three hours to do this but perhaps you could talk about i've i've i haven't got the the name of the lady who suggested doing it but perhaps you could talk about that and what you found in in taking three hours out of the data stairs painting yeah totally i mean this is this is the part of the book where i'm writing about patience and impatience and i think that um one way to understand the feeling of impatience that is that is uh you know as ubiquitous today as ever it's another example of the way we rail against our limitation right and in that case it's the limitation of how fast we can force the rest of the world to to go um [Music] and this idea that certain activities just take the time they take and and sort of dictate their own speed and we just have to if we want to get the benefit of them we just have to fit around that instead of trying to constantly uh accelerate them up to the level where we would feel like we were the ones in control of them there's a art historian at harvard called uh jennifer roberts who um asks all her incoming students to do this exercise where they have to select a painting or a sculpture in the cambridge boston area and go and look at it for three hours straight um [Music] i think they're allowed to take bathroom breaks but that's it right it's just you just you you you sit there stand there i think you know folding chairs are useful here and um i looked at three hours and the point is you know she knows that's a crazily long amount of time but she knows that how people react to that her insight is that um it's very easy to think that you've seen a painting just because you've looked at it for a couple of seconds uh and that the tempo of life that her students are exposed to today through technology through the hyper-competitive atmosphere at universities like harvard and all the rest of it is such that like she needs to play a role as a teacher in deliberately making the tempo be much much much much slower to sort of make them go through the discomfort of staying in that one place to the point where you you can then see things you know i mean you really do see things in a painting if you look for that sort of absurdly long amount of time and i went to do this i went to meet her harvard and i sat at in the harvard art museums and did a and looked at a painting by uh dagar uh for three hours taking notes that's loud um and you know i spent the first half hour thinking i'd totally chosen the wrong painting i should have chosen something with more to look at which was just a manifestation of the impatience right and you go through then another hour of sort of all kinds of fidgety awful discomfort but on the other side of that you i genuinely did literally see things in this painting uh that i hadn't seen until then uh i'm not i'm not using c metaphorically to mean like i had thoughts about what it could mean i literally saw shadows and facial expressions and lines that seemed to suggest areas of space that i hadn't previously seen it's extraordinary and um it's just a sort of slightly extreme example of the benefit of letting something that you're engaged with take its time i think a more day-to-day example uh stop me if you want to be on something else but more day-to-day example of this is just like reading especially kind of reading fiction people me particularly right people say these days that they don't they can't find time to read that's a very common complaint and i think it's true to some extent but mainly i don't think people mean that they don't have a half hour in a 24-hour period when they could read a book some people are that busy but i think a lot of us are not it's that when we find that half hour and sit down with say a novel we don't we're too sort of um amped up and to running too fast to to slow down to the speed that reading a novel or reading a lot of non-fiction books too um requires so your sort of the flywheel is turning so fast that it feels really unpleasant to to slow it down so naturally you know people want to read summaries and synopsis or find techniques of speed reading to to bring reading up to the speed of of the the rest of life um and i think those do have some benefits for just sort of sheer information absorption but the real experience of reading a good book is just one that like there's a little amount of acceleration you can you can bring to it but beyond that it's just it just takes the time it takes it's given by the book the speed right it's not given by you you don't get to um dictate how fast it goes i guess just finally on this topic i always think it's so fascinating how as technology has made has caused it to take much much much less time to to do things that previously took a long time uh we actually get more and more impatient rather than less impatient yeah why is it so much more frustrating to wait eight seconds for a really badly slow loading web page than like three days to be sent some information in the mail it's like it shouldn't be that way we should be like feeling so relaxed and expansive about how much time we have and the idea i explore in the book is that part of what's going on here is just that we have now thanks to uh technological developments got to the point where it really does feel like we are almost able to do everything we want instantaneously almost able to cook our food in zero seconds flat because it only takes two minutes in the microwave almost able to find any information that we want uh you know with without any perceptible time delay and so in that situation of feeling like you are very nearly uh god it's way more frustrating to run up against the remaining ways in which you aren't you know the the fact that novels still take time to consume the fact that there are some slow loading web pages the fact that it does take two whole minutes uh to heat some food in the microwave instead of zero um if you work in an office with a microwave it's always been cancelled out at like seven seconds because i'm sure people tell themselves because their food was ready but actually i think it's because they're just like they couldn't wait they couldn't bear it anymore and that's the moment at which they were like ah screw this i'm just gonna take the food out because i cannot bring myself to wait these seconds it's really you know i i this is totally anecdotal but i think that people get um more impatient and angrier in in traffic in road traffic now that so much of our life is lived on smartphones operating at broadband speeds because i feel like it the contrast between uh so much of what we can do and the material obstacles of the cars in front just gets more and more pronounced and enraging i wondered if the pandemic had in any way exasperated that because we now do even more online when we're used to food being delivered as and when we want it that when we interact with the physical world yeah those frustrations i don't know a year of living inside i think has to an extent made us even more unaccepting of the slowness of the real world um could be yeah i don't know that and i think there are also advanced i think there are also things we see afresh and appreciate and value about the concrete material world as a result of the time you know the time in the pandemic but yeah it's certainly plausible definitely yeah uh if you have any questions uh whilst watching please add them in the in the chat window um we'll get to those after i've spoken uh asked you about well let's say that we have um embraced our finitude and we've decided which big rocks we want to put into our jar what are some tips that you would give us to start embracing this lifestyle what can we what can we actively do now to kind of to to be better at this it's a really good question yeah you should end the book you speak about yes it's a really good question i am a little bit conflicted about answering it because i do think that ultimately this is about a shift in perspective it is about seeing things differently i don't mean that i expect people to sort of read my book and have a sort of instant spiritual enlightenment experience i it can be a small perspective shift i think it is a so i think it is mainly about sort of feeling your way into this limit embracing mindset and what you find then sometimes is that it's really obvious what techniques or methods you should use to implement that or take one thing i've found for example is that you know productivity techniques i experimented with years ago but did so then in the spirit of trying to become the perfect controller of my time they're perfectly useful ways to organize the day now but i'm holding them much more loosely as a result of having felt my way somewhat into this this different mindset that said i definitely think there are some approaches to organizing work and life for example that that make more sense and that go with this mindset more than more than others one whole set of them is any kind of technique or approach to work that focuses on sort of serializing on sequent or making big projects sequential on getting closer to that state of doing one thing at a time whether that's literally on the level of the individual task or on the level of major projects sort of making most of them cue and line up behind one that you're focusing on now and moving it through and finishing it so the kanban approach to workflow management that i'm sure many people be familiar with uh there's a there's a great book called personal kanban by um jim benson and tony anne barry about applying this uh kind of that kind of approach which is obviously a team approach to your individual workflow there are lots of other ways i give a very simple one in the book about well let me stop and pause the point is all these things having progress all these things have in common is that they limit your work in progress they say okay here are the 40 things that feel like they matter and here are the three or so that i'm going to give my attention to and i'm not going to move on to the others until at least one of those three is is completed so you sort of bring yourself to live with the anxiety of knowing that all these other things are going uncompleted in order to bring something uh to completion and then just quickly you know i think i think all sort of time boxing and time blocking approaches can be well adapted to this to this mindset if you say i'm going to try to ring fence two or three hours of the morning for um sort of focused work that really matters to me and i'm going to try to limit my email processing time to an hour and a half towards the end of the day in both those cases what you're saying is you're not saying i'm going to finish this project today or i'm going to get to the bottom of my email today you're going time first you're saying i'm going to dedicate this amount of time to it i'm going to stop at the end of that time that's kind of a way of thinking about your schedule that really respects the finitude of your time instead of one that goes tasks first and says i've got to get through this whole list come what may and then you find you know that you're still at your desk at 11 p.m and the list just got twice as long during the course of day anyway i think you've actually if we can bring up julie julie's question i think you've actually kind of answered this uh so based on oliver's thoughts on the negativity of distraction i'm curious to hear his take on multitasking and how we can do it in a more time efficient manner i feel like you're saying don't do multitasking yeah i mean it's a little there's a there's some there are some subtleties here there are there's research that show you know certain forms of multitasking with using different kinds of attentional channels and stuff can be that can work i don't tell people they shouldn't listen to a podcast while they're doing the vacuuming or something you can you can combine tasks meaningfully in that way when it comes to our sort of focused focused attention on on sort of mentally taxing tasks um you basically just can't multitask anyway and if you think that you are doing what you're really doing is rapidly switching between things between keeping half an eye on your email inbox and a piece of writing you're trying to do say and calling it multitasking and i think that generally what happens there i think there are personality differences i don't want to tell people they definitely should never do it but generally what happens there if you have um you know three or four or five potential destinations for your attention at any moment is that as soon as any one of them gets difficult or challenging you just bounce off to one that's a bit easier and i think this probably especially happens more on the level of projects as opposed to tasks in other words to some degree manage your moment-to-moment tasks how you like but if you are really telling yourself that say in my case it could be three articles that i really care about if i'm really telling myself that all of those three are going to be kind of moved forward roughly at the same time or during the same period of time all that happens is that the moment one of them becomes difficult because guess what meaningful and important things feel difficult and uncomfortable you just move to the other one so you add you end up managing to make no progress on them because you're just sort of escaping the difficulty at each point so um you know it's not that you can't ever combine tasks or don't ever need to keep an eye on some on your email while doing something else but that like if you see what's going on there and you become more conscious of it you're much more likely to be able to avoid this situation of like not really doing anything because what you're actually doing in those contexts is pursuing the emotional feeling of being in control taking care of business having fingers in pies uh at the expense of getting things done that that you care about brilliant look let's take peter's question is this the midlife crisis book like this do you need to have changed extreme do you need to have chased extreme productivity first and having achieved common life goals family career financial to begin seeking a new perspective on time it's such a good question there's two interpretations of it right is it is this did this book emerge from my having a midlife crisis probably in some sense and then is it only useful for people who are at that stage and i i tried very consciously in in writing this book to not make it a book that was only uh beneficial to people who'd sort of exhausted all those techniques or perhaps what i mean is to point out certain truths about how those techniques work that might um that might accelerate uh a sort of profitable kind of crisis in someone who is uh you know uh in their 30s or their late 20s rather than in their 40s like me um i think there's some truth to this right i think that that that one of the easiest ways to uh understand the limitations of this kind of uh limit denying approach to life is to pursue it very energetically for a number of years and exhaust it and and realize that a different method is is required and i also think that many of the sort of things that people achieve in the first half of adulthood um which is often things like you know establishing themselves in a career separating off from their family of origin and being part of a of their own family um you know these things are can be done with and perhaps even sometimes catalyzed by a sort of unrealistic belief in the degree of your control over your life i guess i i guess i just end up by saying that i don't think it is ever um unhelpful to to see how reality is when it comes to time when it comes to our limitations i don't think it's something that you can only understand at a certain point in life and i don't think it's something that um that it's beneficial to sort of have kept from it to have kept from you as an earlier stage of life you know i'll be honest i think it would be i would be surprised if there were sort of 16 17 year olds who who thought that this book spoke to them i would be very gratified but i think it probably is something that comes from i also think that the age at which people encounter the sort of impossible demands of the world that we've created is clearly getting lower right the age of which people say the wage in which people complain about burnout i mean this is that burnout is a thing that people encounter in their 20s now judging by all sorts of reports and books and studies um not something that you have to have got into your sort of mid 50s uh before you've before you're sort of exhausted enough to encounter it so i think that hopefully the relevance of this the age at which this book is relevant to people is is falling as the uh as the world gets uh more and more insane with respect to timing the pace of acceleration is accelerating is healthy let's take mario's tour mario's question uh thanks to the talk my question is about attention span uh is there any reliable evidence on shortened attention spans as patients in the modern world uh is it real or is it a myth did you do any research on on this attention span is a really weird concept it's a very good question attention span is a really weird concept that i um have tried to understand and don't write about in the book because it just seems extremely uh it it sort of falls apart on on closer in inspection patience i think there's good reason to believe um that um that we sort of tolerate shorter and shorter amounts of time that it takes to do things or to have information communicated to us there's all sorts of fascinating longitudinal research on like the the length of edits in movies and the length of political speeches and uh sort of things like that that at least seem to be responding to a desire for um shorter and shorter bits of focus um i think that yeah i don't i i don't think that it's the most useful way to think about what's happening to our attention to think about that we are um less and less able to focus for extended periods of time i think it is probably more helpful and certainly more clearly true anyway that we are more and more tempted to abandon those focused periods of time and that there are more and more services and devices only too willing to you know use cutting-edge technology to keep us distracted once we have left those uh those that that focus for for distraction so it's in a way you're talking about attention span there but in a way you're talking about the sense that there are other possibilities and if you find yourself in a hut on a mountainside with no internet access and nothing to do but write your novel you're more likely to write your novel not because you've suddenly developed a long attention span but because um alternatives have been taken away from you the the sort of tormenting choice of other options is gone for a while yeah i find when i really need to get something done i will leave my phone and laptop home and take a notepad and a pen to a coffee shop and that's that i can't do anything else except yeah get through that yeah uh i'd love to know um how are you thinking about teaching this to your you have a son how are you thinking about teaching this how can we how can we what should we be teaching our children about this this concept such an interesting question and i don't feel like he's four turning five so i still really don't feel like i know what i'm doing when it comes to parenting and also he keeps getting older and changing so what anything i do learn becomes out of date um i you know i have been sort of fascinated and slightly dismayed just they obviously everyone says it's about kids right they reflect your your own personality back to you in ways that are often uncomfortable you know that when he started to sort of ask what we were doing next what we're doing next and trying to like get a schedule for the day into his head i was like oh my god i've really totally inculcated productivity geekhood uh into him and i'm hoping that uh you know i i think i see that being out here in uh more spending more time in nature is is something that sort of seeps into his uh bones i tell you what i think is the the most sort of uh daunting lesson that i have learned about inculcating lessons i guess is that uh you really have to do it yourself if you want the kid to do it too in other words you if you want to be if you want your child to grow up to be someone who isn't checking their phone every three seconds you have to not check your phone every three seconds and even more weirdly i think it's true that you have to not be i mean he doesn't have a phone but you know what i mean he's already he you know he's he's very interested by screens that are in the house and that's fine but i don't want him to be completely fixated by them not only do you have to be better at yourself in their presence but you sort of have to genuinely live it in your whole life even when they're in bed it's a really strange kind of uh almost kind of uh paranormal phenomenon or something right that like um you can't just uh put them to bed and then for two hours become a completely scattered uh terrible user of time or or something like that if you really want to model those lessons so that's what i'm sort of grappling with i don't want to make it sound entirely to do with screens that's just sort of everyone's always worrying about that so much but like to be present in the moment like i feel like the very best thing i can do is to be better at that and do you think do you think writing the book as a self-confessed um time management do you think writing the book has helped you become better at you know yeah no definitely i think lots of people sometimes assume the way books get written is you sort of have a great insight and then you set it down in in writing but for me the experience of the writing this book was that i did sort of have to as i discovered what i thought about time through writing it i did have to sort of become more of that become more of that person uh partly it's just accountability right i mean if i'm going to give some talk somewhere and someone spots me like impatiently freaking out about how like long the microwave is taking then i'm kind of it's pretty embarrassing but but more generally and more authentically you know it's just like no i i understand intellectually a huge number of things to be true now about time that i previously didn't and then the long haul is kind of living into those uh intellectual realizations and i've and i've done it somewhat and i've got a long way to go wonderful well oliver thank you so much for joining us today it's been it's been genuinely insightful i can't recommend the book enough available in audio you said you've done the audio book as well so yes that's available uh i have not done one of these talks and and put as many post-it notes inside it um as ever uh so yeah genuinely recommend uh is a great read for everyone a good use of one of your four thousand weeks i think was a quote i've stolen from another review online um thank you so on behalf of everyone watching now and in the future thank you so much for joining us hopefully one day for your next book you can join us in the office i will be delightful um otherwise oliver thank you so much for joining us today thank you it's been a pleasure i really enjoyed it and great questions thank you thank you [Music]

by oliver berkman author of 4 000 weeks time and how to use it uh oliver is the author of the antidote happiness for people who can't stand positive thinking and for many years wrote a popular weekly column on psychology for the guardian this column will change your life here's a devoted following for his writing on productivity mortality the power of limits and be building a meaningful life in an age of bewilderment uh please join me in thanking oliver for joining us today oliver hi thanks very much for inviting me this is great thank you so much for coming uh well look i am genuinely excited about talking to you uh three four four thousand weeks uh i i i've so many questions so many thoughts about it perhaps you could start by telling us what does four thousand weeks represent why why the why the title of the book so four thousand weeks is extremely approximately the average human lifespan in the west expressed in terms of weeks if you live to be 80 you'll have had a few more than that as i'm sure people can figure out it's pretty straightforward mental arithmetic but it's um i i completely rounded it to a uh to a sort of punchy round number it's it's it's basically how much we can reasonably expect to get to to get to play with in terms it feels like a very small number when represented in which indeed even those who live to be a hundred it's the order of six thousand weeks it's not it's not it's not a lot right no there's something very interesting about weeks because if you express it in days well it's it's a very large number if you press it in years it's very small but we get the scent we have the feeling that a year lasts goes on forever so it doesn't really matter it's that it's that middle zone where you're expressing it in a relatively small number of a quantity that nonetheless we feel is very brief and irrelevant in the course of our lives it doesn't seem like if you waste a week of your life it ought to matter yeah that's very cool um so the book broadly uh speaks about um how do we choose what we choose so that's we can kind of touch upon some of those those subjects um you open by talking about um acknowledging and embracing the the limit embracing life and how time has perhaps had a different meaning to people over the ages perhaps you could talk about that um and how we think about time now yeah sure i mean i think par part of what i find myself doing in talking about this book is is sort of deflecting a potential interpretation of that title i mean i'm glad i've we gave this book an attention grabbing title but there's a misinterpretation i think which would be like okay this is time is incredibly short therefore the only way to make the most use of of it is to live in a kind of white knuckle um very self-conscious and and strenuous attempt to sort of eke the most out of every day and you know do extreme sports every weekend and uh and uh you know never never lose a second and i think that actually what i'm trying to get at here is that there's a huge amount of relief as well as energy and motivation and focus that comes from acknowledging how limited we are with respect to time and thus seeing all the different ways in which we can talk about this i'm sure you know especially in kind of productivity culture and time management but not only all the ways in which we we we proceed as if we might find a way to fit everything in we might find a way to become so efficient as to not have to encounter the the ramifications of being finite so it's really about a sort of dropping back down to the ground and uh making time for a handful of things that really matter and giving up this impossible struggle to sort of uh be infinite with respect to time as opposed to this kind of very exhausting and rather stressful kind of carpe diem approach which you do see in popular culture which i think ultimately is actually just another form of the of the attitude that i'm uh criticizing uh in the book to go even further into sort of unseating our conventional views of time yes you're right i think there's lots of good evidence that the example i hear in the book is english medieval peasants although i think it would also apply to many different cultures at different times in history perhaps also to some indigenous cultures today that this whole notion of time as something separate from you time is as a resource that you have to use well or that you could be guilty of wasting or that you need to sort of save through efficiency techniques the whole conceptual basis of that distinction uh i think we can confidently say just wouldn't have occurred to a kind of working class laborer in early medieval england right um time for for them and for many other people it would have followed the patterns that anthropologists call task orientation right so instead of thinking about your activities as lined up against a schedule or a timeline or a calendar or something it's the tasks themselves that would have given the rhythm to the day time would have just been the medium in which your life unfolded rather than something that you could sort of psychologically objectify and then be tormented by or try to dominate or feel hounded by and you know the productivity guru who had gone up to a medieval farmer and said like why don't you uh do all the milking for the month uh all in one day to get it out of the way because batching your tasks is a really great way to to get more things done i mean obviously that would have been lunacy and still today it's essentially you know lunacy as an approach to milking cows because those things just need doing when they need doing and crops need harvesting when they need harvesting and you know i think we all or many of us have some experience of this kind of time i think that one very obvious example is in the first few months with a newborn baby but i think that you don't have to be a parent to have been in places where that kind of sense of the schedule the sense of the timetable falls away and you're just sort of in time uh it has its disadvantages because you you can't build a sort of industrial technologically advanced society without without um that objectified idea of time but it has some big advantages as well which are a kind of peace of mind that i think is a lot harder for us to access uh today it was um you spoke about when you um time used to be measured in how long it takes to do a task so having to take instead of just using a minute or an hour you'd say all the time it takes to bring in the hair or milk the cat bring the hair milk out it actually made me think of i have a i have a five-year-old daughter and we measure time in the length of her favorite tv shows like how long would it take to get to this bus stop well at the time it takes to watch two of these shows so actually for children who don't understand minutes and hours we still use task based times i thought was quite interesting yeah no it's fascinating and even that kind of comparison like i don't think that would have been the normal way of talking my understanding of the literature is it wouldn't have been a normal way of talking about time it's just that when you had to do some comparing like there wasn't the widespread notion there wasn't the white there wasn't a sort of um widespread adoption of clocks or of time measuring devices among ordinary people so yeah you just have to grasp for some other for some other task as a as a comparator and you know people tend to think that life moved more slowly back then as another example of this but i think that probably that concept of life moving slowly would have been the thing that didn't make sense if you sort of time travel back to medieval england it's not that life moved more slowly but just like what slowly as compared to watch i mean it's just life it's just unfolding it's only a sort of post-industrialization that it is ubiquitous uh to think about life unfolding according to something that isn't life uh a time a timeline or a yardstick um you get it in ancient greece and rome like you get all sorts of things but it's that's a that's a new thing for for almost everybody in the world to be um thinking as a way of governing their lives and perhaps post internet we not only compare ourselves to how much we can family today but how much others are able or seem to be able to cram into a day and so the question of oh how do i do all of the things it's not just all of those those those big rocks that i want to accomplish but that others seem to be doing which i think uh perhaps you could talk about your dislike of the big rocks parable which for those i imagine that many those dudes but for those who don't know it's the it's it's how do you fit the big rocks the small box and the sand into a jar the idea being you have to put the big rocks in first and then the smaller things can fit around those but you dislike that for a very good reason well this is a metaphor for prioritization and it says you know if you want to have time to do everything that counts just make sure you make time first for the things that that really matter um yeah i mean i i think there is some wisdom in here but but the my basic objection is that this is a this is a rigged experiment the uh the person in the in the parable who is bringing these rocks and pebbles and sand into the classroom or seminar room or whether it's supposed to happen has only brought enough rocks uh that he knows in advance will will fit into the jar um and i don't think that our primary problem on the level of individual time management today is that we prioritize things badly although we do i think it is that there are too many big rocks there are too many things that genuinely matter and you know if we had 40 hours in a day we could still fill that time with things that genuinely matter it it isn't that if you find the right tricks and techniques you'll be able to get rid of only all the unimportant tedious stuff and then spend your life in this kind of unfolding of just pure meaningfulness and feel like you're doing everything it's like no you're gonna have to not do lots of things that do matter uh in order to make time for the things that you that you care about the most out of those out of those things let's talk about the efficiency traps so you talk about uh the the curse perhaps of clearing the decks we all come in and i've seen people block out the first hour of their calendars to clear emails you talk about how that actually creates more work right i mean this is something that i'm sure a number of people watching will be familiar with in in other contexts right this general idea which crops up as all sorts of other paradoxes the jevons paradox in in energy efficiency and a bunch of others but if you make a system more efficient without regard to any other governing value you just pursue greater efficiency in processing things through the system then all else being equal the system will fill with more and more stuff rather than bringing peace of mind and will or um or like empty time or capacity and it will um fill with with more and more junk rather than uh good stuff so applied to time management the idea here is you know if you get incredibly good at processing your email all else being equal what will happen is you'll just get more email uh because you'll reply to people and they'll reply to you and those replies will generate replies and they'll go forever you get a reputation for being responsive to email so more people will reach out to email you and just in general email unless it's stopped by some other act on your part email will just come to dominate your life more and more in direct contradiction to your motive initial motivation to uh to sort of bring email under control this is you know this is parkinson's law work expands to fill the time available for its completion um it's that thing where they widen motorways to relieve traffic congestion and it makes the uh it provides an added incentive for more drivers to use that route and so the the congestion sort of tends gradually back towards where it originally was so when i'm talking about the efficiency trap i'm talking about a thing which i think is encouraged by a lot of sort of less good productivity advice and productivity culture which is this idea that there is some inherent benefit in just getting more efficient at doing more things in a smaller amount of time firstly there's no benefit in doing things per se unless they're the good the right things to do and then secondly yeah you get into this problem where where um the more stuff that comes across your radar the the more likely you are to accept additional things to do that actually aren't worth your time because none of these incoming things will have to meet this um filter or me sort of get over this hurdle of is this worth sacrificing something else for because you've convinced yourself that you're gonna have time for for everything when i was working as a journalist on a sort of day-to-day as a feature writer at the guardian um yeah the the better i got at doing stuff the more more efficient i got at doing stuff the the more i began to realize what i was really good at was doing stuff that didn't matter and that the things that i really cared about would just get endlessly postponed while i told myself yeah i was clearing the decks which was your original question and we could talk more about that but anyway i'll stop there for now no that's really cool um and i certainly know when when i clear the decks i actually get a little um like an endorphin rush for having done something like that the element of completeness but um and i don't want to perhaps address the more difficult task um but let's talk about um you talk about finitude and pronounce that correctly uh which which i've sort of summarized is acknowledging our mortality which sounds very a bit bleak but actually when you when you accept that and think about it it can be liberating perhaps you could talk about that concept you've you've coined i mean i didn't invent the word finitude people have people do wonder about how to pronounce it all i can say is in the audiobook for this i say finitude a lot so i really i really hope that's the right uh the right pronunciation i i just mean yes i this is a consequence of the fact that we die but i don't think that this book is really about you know it's not really about death and dying and mortality and that kind of very melodramatic kind of and very difficult uh aspect of human existence it's not about suggesting that anyone can sort of completely confront their mortality i don't think i certainly don't think i have um but rather the fact that our time is limited and that we are sort of material creatures in limited time with limited energy and limited attentional bandwidth and and all the rest of it the consequence of this i'm sort of wrapping up in this word finitude to refer to the state of being limited and therefore having to make by definition you know trade-offs and to exist in a world of opportunity costs and having to make tough decisions not being able to do all the things that we are you know psychologically able to think about and imagine not being able to meet all the demands that society might throw at us there's just no reason to assume that if we can think of something or somebody can ask something of us uh that there's capacity for it in a in a human in a human life uh uh beyond a certain point there won't be and uh these kind of sacrifices will just be be built into the situation so i think what i'm saying for a big chunk of the book is that like this is such an uncomfortable feeling that we pursue all sorts of uh ultimately counterproductive activities to sort of engage in emotional avoidance to feel like we're limitless when we're not i think that a lot of uh distraction is is based on is rooted in that we could talk about that if you like and i think a lot of time management stuff and certainly the years i spent as a sort of weirdo productivity geek um still am a little bit but you know recovering maybe they were it was about trying to achieve a kind of control over my time and my projects and my work in my life that would you know that subliminally would enable you not to have me not to have to confront this i think situation yeah you do you define distraction is motivated by the desire to try to flee something painful about our experience with the present which i quite which i quite liked and um we think about um well perhaps we could talk about the attention economy and how that feeds kind of our desire to be distracted and sort of be feel like we're achieving something whereas actually we're not achieving anything sure i mean i i don't know the individual details of people watching this but i don't feel that any of you are likely to need a sort of basic introduction to the idea of of the attention economy what i'm what i'm trying to explore in the book is well two points really firstly how the firstly that attention is so fundamental to the experience of life that calling it a resource like a limited resource people talk about it is almost uh a misnomer you know it's it there's a sense in which attention just is life and and what you pay attention to over the course of your life will sum up to what your life will have been so it's an incredibly uh serious thing to be involved with either as a user of technology or as or as someone working in uh digital technology but also secondly this thing that i don't think gets us enough attention which is you know i have many many criticisms of social media platforms and algorithmically driven you know attention mining effectively but but we talk a lot as if this is a sort of force that we i mean if you if you read a lot of stuff or you watch you know the social dilemma et cetera you you might be left with the impression that the the typical moment of digital distraction is one in which you know i'm sort of working away on a piece of writing and i'm feeling thrilled by it and it's so wonderful and i'm really enjoying myself and then um like somehow the the evil tendrils of silicon valley come and sort of grab me unwillingly away from my from my work and i do think that some of the tendrils of silicon valley are evil and that we should talk critically about them but that's not what happens what happens is i'm finding the work unpleasant or intimidating or boring or difficult and i am thrilled by the opportunity to go and scroll through down my phone for a bit instead and do something to leave or to leave aside something that i thought was what really mattered to me and go and do something that by definition if it's distraction like doesn't matter to me yeah and so i'm looking in the book at the idea that basically what's going on here is that that um you know it's not a coincidence that things that matter to us induce discomfort um they bring us up against the limits of our capacities and our ability to control how time unfolds you're writing a chapter of your novel you don't know that it's going to go well you don't know you've got what it takes you don't know that people will receive it well it might be forgotten or ignored or mocked you want to have an important difficult conversation with your spouse you don't know how it's going to unfold it might leave you feeling emotionally emotionally vulnerable it might lead to an angry exchange you know you can't you don't have that control it's precisely because these things matter that they evoke these uncomfortable feelings and then i think it feels absolutely wonderful to do something uh less important instead and to sort of zone out and i think the phenomenology of the internet is a super interesting part of this because actually these days we've always been distractible for these reasons but these days not only samuel johnson wrote about it but not only do we have reason to flee the stuff we care about because of discomfort but we have a place to go when we're fleeing it that phenomenologically speaking does feel kind of limitless it does feel like um a a realm where limits don't apply where you can portray yourself how you like find out about things that are happening thousands and thousands of miles away in virtually no time at all um it's very seductive as a as a as a way not to confront the the sort of limitations of being a human creature in time but i do think that ultimately it's only by confronting some of those limitations that we that we make progress on the things that we that we care about so it's uh getting finding some way to tolerate or accommodate or get friendly with that discomfort i think is a pretty much a superpower when it comes to thriving in the modern world no no i certainly struggle that i know every time i delete myself on purpose forget my password for social media i get distracted by the news or putting on the radio or something something else um well the second half of your book uh really speaks about the concept of time and how we how we define it and how we think about it i thought i might just read a small section which really spoke to me at the beginning of chapter eight sure um there's another sense in which treating time is something that we own and get to control seems to make life worse inevitably we become obsessed with using it well whereupon we discover an unfortunate truth the more you focus on using time well the more each day begins to feel like something you have to get through on route to some karma better more fulfilling point in the future which never actually arrives this this future chasing or i think you call it like the when i finally view of ourselves i mean is it is that just part of the human condition is that something we can we can acknowledge i know i know i'm always sort of doing something to get to the next stage um how do you how how have you thought about that and how we can for one of a better phrase live more in the moment yeah such a big question we can come to that because i i have thoughts about that but um yeah i think that um i i don't i think that an instrumental approach to experience right to using to to doing things now for some future gain is absolutely sort of you know as old as humanity nothing would ever get done if people couldn't sort of persevere to to do things and building civilization would never have would never have happened i think then once we all enter into this very instrumentalized notion of time that we were talking about at the beginning where we're all trying to use not only up the resources around us but we're thinking of time as a resource to use well then again it becomes something we have to do i wouldn't have written this book if i wasn't willing to instrumentalize time in a certain in a certain sense and nobody would ever get anything done in their in their professional lives if they didn't so i'm really talking about a kind of over investment in that stance a sense that i think is driven especially by the economic system that we live in and the stage that that's at now excuse me where it becomes the only form of value it all too easily that sort of instrumental mindset just sort of forces everything else out so so in other words you come to think about every moment of time only or pretty much only in terms of its value for some future moment of time and that when it's taken to that absolute place that that clearly is self-defeating and an irrational and and unfortunate uh way to be because it's um you know by definition you're going to you're placing the val the whole value of life constantly uh at some point that is not now and it only ever is now so you're never going to kind of cash out the value of life and find value in the moment so i think it's about sort of having the ability to take both of those perspectives it's certainly i don't recommend and i certainly have never retained myself the ability to care only about this precise moment um and not where it's leading but i think that you know over investment in that we see the effects of that all around us in sort of sapping the meaning from people's lives like what is this all for because they're aware on some level that what it's all for when they get to the time when it's supposedly all four it'll all still be for something in the future from then as well and and so on it felt like trying to find the fun in the moment and perhaps we you think about childhood where you know nursery leads to reception reception leads to this year and you know you're then working towards university and university more than job is for retirement and at which point is yeah at what point are you sort of having fun in the in the moment right right um perhaps you could um you talk about you know within within our con how we work with time and what we think about it um rediscovering rest and hobbies for the sake of it and perhaps you know when we think about having more fun do do we do enough things enough activities which we only do for their own sake you just moved to yorkshire where you probably have more opportunities to go for a walk in the in the in the countryside yeah i'm really i'm having a walk yeah i'm really putting my claims to the test here because i've got no excuse left anymore not to spend a significant chunk of my time hiking on the north york moors and uh so if i don't then i really am condemned uh as a as a failure of uh embracing the moment so we shall see i've been here two weeks i've been on a couple of hikes um i'll report back later um i think that um you know this instrumental this exclusive focus on the instrumental use of time uh is sort of at its most ironic in the context of leisure because like it's if you're even treating your leisure as a means to an end solely as a means to an end then like what what's left the the certainly the sort of ancient greek speaking broadly conception of leisure was that it was the the goal of everything else so you maybe had to work um and you maybe had to do all sorts of things but but but the reason you were doing them all was so that you could get the time the leisure time that was that was sort of life uh in its highest expression which admittedly for ancient philosophers tends to mean what you should do with that time is like philosophy they were that was a so that's not this doesn't necessarily follow but so i'm sort of making the case in the book for something that the the contemporary philosopher kieran satya has described as atylic activities things that you do not because of what they're leading up to or amounting to that are not defined by some kind of end point hiking is a fun example um just because um you know anyone who has any experience of enjoying a walk in the country knows you you probably drive the car to a car park somewhere and then you either go in a loop back to the car or you walk you know a few miles to a to an extreme point and turn around and come back if you wanted to do either of those things most efficiently the simplest way would just be not to go on the hike in the first place um all you're doing is getting getting back to where you started now there are instrumental benefits you know there are you can it's a it's good for your physical fitness uh you um might be like recording your route on all these social um apps for for you know now that enable you to share your um the views that you're gazing out over but basically you hike to hike and as cetera says you know there's not going to become a you're not going to get to a point in your life where you think um okay i've done all the hiking i'd aim to do that job is complete you are going to stop but you're not going to stop because you've reached the end of a project or exhausted an activity you're just going to stop because eventually you will or your interest might change or you may be too old and frail to continue or any number of things and that kind of i think that's i think that's what the the i think that's what is crystallized in the idea of a hobby and i think it's probably why the idea of a hobby feels a little bit cringe and embarrassing in the modern world right unlike as i say but unlike side hustles which are hobbies that have a very clear instrumental value that you're going to make money out of them and they are they are cool and hip and and it's good to have a side hustle it's kind of embarrassing to have a hobby and i think that that is at least in part because they don't fit and they are sort of culturally subversive in a way uh they don't they don't fit into this idea that everything has got to be for something else and quite possibly that something else is is financial profit but not necessarily it's just it's all for something other than itself and that's not true of uh you know of going on a hike um yeah so yeah that's that's that's very cool um i've written on my notes here um painting staring which uh i've not i've not yet had the time to go and find three hours to do this but perhaps you could talk about i've i've i haven't got the the name of the lady who suggested doing it but perhaps you could talk about that and what you found in in taking three hours out of the data stairs painting yeah totally i mean this is this is the part of the book where i'm writing about patience and impatience and i think that um one way to understand the feeling of impatience that is that is uh you know as ubiquitous today as ever it's another example of the way we rail against our limitation right and in that case it's the limitation of how fast we can force the rest of the world to to go um [Music] and this idea that certain activities just take the time they take and and sort of dictate their own speed and we just have to if we want to get the benefit of them we just have to fit around that instead of trying to constantly uh accelerate them up to the level where we would feel like we were the ones in control of them there's a art historian at harvard called uh jennifer roberts who um asks all her incoming students to do this exercise where they have to select a painting or a sculpture in the cambridge boston area and go and look at it for three hours straight um [Music] i think they're allowed to take bathroom breaks but that's it right it's just you just you you you sit there stand there i think you know folding chairs are useful here and um i looked at three hours and the point is you know she knows that's a crazily long amount of time but she knows that how people react to that her insight is that um it's very easy to think that you've seen a painting just because you've looked at it for a couple of seconds uh and that the tempo of life that her students are exposed to today through technology through the hyper-competitive atmosphere at universities like harvard and all the rest of it is such that like she needs to play a role as a teacher in deliberately making the tempo be much much much much slower to sort of make them go through the discomfort of staying in that one place to the point where you you can then see things you know i mean you really do see things in a painting if you look for that sort of absurdly long amount of time and i went to do this i went to meet her harvard and i sat at in the harvard art museums and did a and looked at a painting by uh dagar uh for three hours taking notes that's loud um and you know i spent the first half hour thinking i'd totally chosen the wrong painting i should have chosen something with more to look at which was just a manifestation of the impatience right and you go through then another hour of sort of all kinds of fidgety awful discomfort but on the other side of that you i genuinely did literally see things in this painting uh that i hadn't seen until then uh i'm not i'm not using c metaphorically to mean like i had thoughts about what it could mean i literally saw shadows and facial expressions and lines that seemed to suggest areas of space that i hadn't previously seen it's extraordinary and um it's just a sort of slightly extreme example of the benefit of letting something that you're engaged with take its time i think a more day-to-day example uh stop me if you want to be on something else but more day-to-day example of this is just like reading especially kind of reading fiction people me particularly right people say these days that they don't they can't find time to read that's a very common complaint and i think it's true to some extent but mainly i don't think people mean that they don't have a half hour in a 24-hour period when they could read a book some people are that busy but i think a lot of us are not it's that when we find that half hour and sit down with say a novel we don't we're too sort of um amped up and to running too fast to to slow down to the speed that reading a novel or reading a lot of non-fiction books too um requires so your sort of the flywheel is turning so fast that it feels really unpleasant to to slow it down so naturally you know people want to read summaries and synopsis or find techniques of speed reading to to bring reading up to the speed of of the the rest of life um and i think those do have some benefits for just sort of sheer information absorption but the real experience of reading a good book is just one that like there's a little amount of acceleration you can you can bring to it but beyond that it's just it just takes the time it takes it's given by the book the speed right it's not given by you you don't get to um dictate how fast it goes i guess just finally on this topic i always think it's so fascinating how as technology has made has caused it to take much much much less time to to do things that previously took a long time uh we actually get more and more impatient rather than less impatient yeah why is it so much more frustrating to wait eight seconds for a really badly slow loading web page than like three days to be sent some information in the mail it's like it shouldn't be that way we should be like feeling so relaxed and expansive about how much time we have and the idea i explore in the book is that part of what's going on here is just that we have now thanks to uh technological developments got to the point where it really does feel like we are almost able to do everything we want instantaneously almost able to cook our food in zero seconds flat because it only takes two minutes in the microwave almost able to find any information that we want uh you know with without any perceptible time delay and so in that situation of feeling like you are very nearly uh god it's way more frustrating to run up against the remaining ways in which you aren't you know the the fact that novels still take time to consume the fact that there are some slow loading web pages the fact that it does take two whole minutes uh to heat some food in the microwave instead of zero um if you work in an office with a microwave it's always been cancelled out at like seven seconds because i'm sure people tell themselves because their food was ready but actually i think it's because they're just like they couldn't wait they couldn't bear it anymore and that's the moment at which they were like ah screw this i'm just gonna take the food out because i cannot bring myself to wait these seconds it's really you know i i this is totally anecdotal but i think that people get um more impatient and angrier in in traffic in road traffic now that so much of our life is lived on smartphones operating at broadband speeds because i feel like it the contrast between uh so much of what we can do and the material obstacles of the cars in front just gets more and more pronounced and enraging i wondered if the pandemic had in any way exasperated that because we now do even more online when we're used to food being delivered as and when we want it that when we interact with the physical world yeah those frustrations i don't know a year of living inside i think has to an extent made us even more unaccepting of the slowness of the real world um could be yeah i don't know that and i think there are also advanced i think there are also things we see afresh and appreciate and value about the concrete material world as a result of the time you know the time in the pandemic but yeah it's certainly plausible definitely yeah uh if you have any questions uh whilst watching please add them in the in the chat window um we'll get to those after i've spoken uh asked you about well let's say that we have um embraced our finitude and we've decided which big rocks we want to put into our jar what are some tips that you would give us to start embracing this lifestyle what can we what can we actively do now to kind of to to be better at this it's a really good question yeah you should end the book you speak about yes it's a really good question i am a little bit conflicted about answering it because i do think that ultimately this is about a shift in perspective it is about seeing things differently i don't mean that i expect people to sort of read my book and have a sort of instant spiritual enlightenment experience i it can be a small perspective shift i think it is a so i think it is mainly about sort of feeling your way into this limit embracing mindset and what you find then sometimes is that it's really obvious what techniques or methods you should use to implement that or take one thing i've found for example is that you know productivity techniques i experimented with years ago but did so then in the spirit of trying to become the perfect controller of my time they're perfectly useful ways to organize the day now but i'm holding them much more loosely as a result of having felt my way somewhat into this this different mindset that said i definitely think there are some approaches to organizing work and life for example that that make more sense and that go with this mindset more than more than others one whole set of them is any kind of technique or approach to work that focuses on sort of serializing on sequent or making big projects sequential on getting closer to that state of doing one thing at a time whether that's literally on the level of the individual task or on the level of major projects sort of making most of them cue and line up behind one that you're focusing on now and moving it through and finishing it so the kanban approach to workflow management that i'm sure many people be familiar with uh there's a there's a great book called personal kanban by um jim benson and tony anne barry about applying this uh kind of that kind of approach which is obviously a team approach to your individual workflow there are lots of other ways i give a very simple one in the book about well let me stop and pause the point is all these things having progress all these things have in common is that they limit your work in progress they say okay here are the 40 things that feel like they matter and here are the three or so that i'm going to give my attention to and i'm not going to move on to the others until at least one of those three is is completed so you sort of bring yourself to live with the anxiety of knowing that all these other things are going uncompleted in order to bring something uh to completion and then just quickly you know i think i think all sort of time boxing and time blocking approaches can be well adapted to this to this mindset if you say i'm going to try to ring fence two or three hours of the morning for um sort of focused work that really matters to me and i'm going to try to limit my email processing time to an hour and a half towards the end of the day in both those cases what you're saying is you're not saying i'm going to finish this project today or i'm going to get to the bottom of my email today you're going time first you're saying i'm going to dedicate this amount of time to it i'm going to stop at the end of that time that's kind of a way of thinking about your schedule that really respects the finitude of your time instead of one that goes tasks first and says i've got to get through this whole list come what may and then you find you know that you're still at your desk at 11 p.m and the list just got twice as long during the course of day anyway i think you've actually if we can bring up julie julie's question i think you've actually kind of answered this uh so based on oliver's thoughts on the negativity of distraction i'm curious to hear his take on multitasking and how we can do it in a more time efficient manner i feel like you're saying don't do multitasking yeah i mean it's a little there's a there's some there are some subtleties here there are there's research that show you know certain forms of multitasking with using different kinds of attentional channels and stuff can be that can work i don't tell people they shouldn't listen to a podcast while they're doing the vacuuming or something you can you can combine tasks meaningfully in that way when it comes to our sort of focused focused attention on on sort of mentally taxing tasks um you basically just can't multitask anyway and if you think that you are doing what you're really doing is rapidly switching between things between keeping half an eye on your email inbox and a piece of writing you're trying to do say and calling it multitasking and i think that generally what happens there i think there are personality differences i don't want to tell people they definitely should never do it but generally what happens there if you have um you know three or four or five potential destinations for your attention at any moment is that as soon as any one of them gets difficult or challenging you just bounce off to one that's a bit easier and i think this probably especially happens more on the level of projects as opposed to tasks in other words to some degree manage your moment-to-moment tasks how you like but if you are really telling yourself that say in my case it could be three articles that i really care about if i'm really telling myself that all of those three are going to be kind of moved forward roughly at the same time or during the same period of time all that happens is that the moment one of them becomes difficult because guess what meaningful and important things feel difficult and uncomfortable you just move to the other one so you add you end up managing to make no progress on them because you're just sort of escaping the difficulty at each point so um you know it's not that you can't ever combine tasks or don't ever need to keep an eye on some on your email while doing something else but that like if you see what's going on there and you become more conscious of it you're much more likely to be able to avoid this situation of like not really doing anything because what you're actually doing in those contexts is pursuing the emotional feeling of being in control taking care of business having fingers in pies uh at the expense of getting things done that that you care about brilliant look let's take peter's question is this the midlife crisis book like this do you need to have changed extreme do you need to have chased extreme productivity first and having achieved common life goals family career financial to begin seeking a new perspective on time it's such a good question there's two interpretations of it right is it is this did this book emerge from my having a midlife crisis probably in some sense and then is it only useful for people who are at that stage and i i tried very consciously in in writing this book to not make it a book that was only uh beneficial to people who'd sort of exhausted all those techniques or perhaps what i mean is to point out certain truths about how those techniques work that might um that might accelerate uh a sort of profitable kind of crisis in someone who is uh you know uh in their 30s or their late 20s rather than in their 40s like me um i think there's some truth to this right i think that that that one of the easiest ways to uh understand the limitations of this kind of uh limit denying approach to life is to pursue it very energetically for a number of years and exhaust it and and realize that a different method is is required and i also think that many of the sort of things that people achieve in the first half of adulthood um which is often things like you know establishing themselves in a career separating off from their family of origin and being part of a of their own family um you know these things are can be done with and perhaps even sometimes catalyzed by a sort of unrealistic belief in the degree of your control over your life i guess i i guess i just end up by saying that i don't think it is ever um unhelpful to to see how reality is when it comes to time when it comes to our limitations i don't think it's something that you can only understand at a certain point in life and i don't think it's something that um that it's beneficial to sort of have kept from it to have kept from you as an earlier stage of life you know i'll be honest i think it would be i would be surprised if there were sort of 16 17 year olds who who thought that this book spoke to them i would be very gratified but i think it probably is something that comes from i also think that the age at which people encounter the sort of impossible demands of the world that we've created is clearly getting lower right the age of which people say the wage in which people complain about burnout i mean this is that burnout is a thing that people encounter in their 20s now judging by all sorts of reports and books and studies um not something that you have to have got into your sort of mid 50s uh before you've before you're sort of exhausted enough to encounter it so i think that hopefully the relevance of this the age at which this book is relevant to people is is falling as the uh as the world gets uh more and more insane with respect to timing the pace of acceleration is accelerating is healthy let's take mario's tour mario's question uh thanks to the talk my question is about attention span uh is there any reliable evidence on shortened attention spans as patients in the modern world uh is it real or is it a myth did you do any research on on this attention span is a really weird concept it's a very good question attention span is a really weird concept that i um have tried to understand and don't write about in the book because it just seems extremely uh it it sort of falls apart on on closer in inspection patience i think there's good reason to believe um that um that we sort of tolerate shorter and shorter amounts of time that it takes to do things or to have information communicated to us there's all sorts of fascinating longitudinal research on like the the length of edits in movies and the length of political speeches and uh sort of things like that that at least seem to be responding to a desire for um shorter and shorter bits of focus um i think that yeah i don't i i don't think that it's the most useful way to think about what's happening to our attention to think about that we are um less and less able to focus for extended periods of time i think it is probably more helpful and certainly more clearly true anyway that we are more and more tempted to abandon those focused periods of time and that there are more and more services and devices only too willing to you know use cutting-edge technology to keep us distracted once we have left those uh those that that focus for for distraction so it's in a way you're talking about attention span there but in a way you're talking about the sense that there are other possibilities and if you find yourself in a hut on a mountainside with no internet access and nothing to do but write your novel you're more likely to write your novel not because you've suddenly developed a long attention span but because um alternatives have been taken away from you the the sort of tormenting choice of other options is gone for a while yeah i find when i really need to get something done i will leave my phone and laptop home and take a notepad and a pen to a coffee shop and that's that i can't do anything else except yeah get through that yeah uh i'd love to know um how are you thinking about teaching this to your you have a son how are you thinking about teaching this how can we how can we what should we be teaching our children about this this concept such an interesting question and i don't feel like he's four turning five so i still really don't feel like i know what i'm doing when it comes to parenting and also he keeps getting older and changing so what anything i do learn becomes out of date um i you know i have been sort of fascinated and slightly dismayed just they obviously everyone says it's about kids right they reflect your your own personality back to you in ways that are often uncomfortable you know that when he started to sort of ask what we were doing next what we're doing next and trying to like get a schedule for the day into his head i was like oh my god i've really totally inculcated productivity geekhood uh into him and i'm hoping that uh you know i i think i see that being out here in uh more spending more time in nature is is something that sort of seeps into his uh bones i tell you what i think is the the most sort of uh daunting lesson that i have learned about inculcating lessons i guess is that uh you really have to do it yourself if you want the kid to do it too in other words you if you want to be if you want your child to grow up to be someone who isn't checking their phone every three seconds you have to not check your phone every three seconds and even more weirdly i think it's true that you have to not be i mean he doesn't have a phone but you know what i mean he's already he you know he's he's very interested by screens that are in the house and that's fine but i don't want him to be completely fixated by them not only do you have to be better at yourself in their presence but you sort of have to genuinely live it in your whole life even when they're in bed it's a really strange kind of uh almost kind of uh paranormal phenomenon or something right that like um you can't just uh put them to bed and then for two hours become a completely scattered uh terrible user of time or or something like that if you really want to model those lessons so that's what i'm sort of grappling with i don't want to make it sound entirely to do with screens that's just sort of everyone's always worrying about that so much but like to be present in the moment like i feel like the very best thing i can do is to be better at that and do you think do you think writing the book as a self-confessed um time management do you think writing the book has helped you become better at you know yeah no definitely i think lots of people sometimes assume the way books get written is you sort of have a great insight and then you set it down in in writing but for me the experience of the writing this book was that i did sort of have to as i discovered what i thought about time through writing it i did have to sort of become more of that become more of that person uh partly it's just accountability right i mean if i'm going to give some talk somewhere and someone spots me like impatiently freaking out about how like long the microwave is taking then i'm kind of it's pretty embarrassing but but more generally and more authentically you know it's just like no i i understand intellectually a huge number of things to be true now about time that i previously didn't and then the long haul is kind of living into those uh intellectual realizations and i've and i've done it somewhat and i've got a long way to go wonderful well oliver thank you so much for joining us today it's been it's been genuinely insightful i can't recommend the book enough available in audio you said you've done the audio book as well so yes that's available uh i have not done one of these talks and and put as many post-it notes inside it um as ever uh so yeah genuinely recommend uh is a great read for everyone a good use of one of your four thousand weeks i think was a quote i've stolen from another review online um thank you so on behalf of everyone watching now and in the future thank you so much for joining us hopefully one day for your next book you can join us in the office i will be delightful um otherwise oliver thank you so much for joining us today thank you it's been a pleasure i really enjoyed it and great questions thank you thank you [Music]

                "content": "right so the average human in a developed country lives to be around 80 years old which is roughly 4 000 weeks now this poster shows every single week of an average life as one square on this and then the black ones are the weeks that we have already lived now youtube very conveniently tells me how old you are likely to be on average if you watch my channel if you're in the six percent of my audience that's 13 to 17 years old this is about how many weeks you've used up if you're in the 39 that's 18 to 24 you're about here and if you're in the 34 that is 25 to 35 you are here and if you're only 1.1 that's over 65 then you are around here now if you're anything like me this illustration hopefully makes you think damn i want to make the best use of this time especially because the full 4 thousand weeks is definitely not guaranteed and this is exactly what oliver berkman analyzes in his book 4 000 weeks time and how to use it the struggle that we all have with this feeling of really limited time now this book has a pretty interesting kind of philosophical approach to productivity and time management which is why it is the book that we are discussing in today's episode of book club the ongoing series where we distill and discuss highlights from some of my popular most favorite books so almost everything about a relationship with time comes from every day being exactly quantified down to the second by clocks this mechanical time makes us act a bit obsessively counting minutes and hours comparing everything that we've done to the amount of time that it took to do and rewarding or punishing ourselves based on what we did with that time and the more we chop our day up into these perfectly measurable blocks the more time starts to feel like this conveyor belt of jars and boxes that we need to fill up efficiently and productively so that we allegedly make the most of our life now if you're like me you've probably got a pretty secure existence with enough food and shelter and most of your problems are probably time related problems the feeling that you are not optimally filling these jars as they roll past now here are three big examples of time problems that we all face first there is online distraction now being distracted by photos and memes and sometimes pointless stuff on instagram feels really bad because it's time that we could have spent on something more meaningful secondly if we feel like we're not particularly fulfilled in our lives we also feel that's a time problem because it feels like the time that we have to fulfill our hopes and dreams and aspirations is all kind of draining away in the background and the final example is decision paralysis we get paralyzed when it comes to big decisions for example who to marry or what to study at university or what work to do because we know that choosing one option often closes the door on a bunch of other options that we'll never have the time to revisit now none of this would be a problem if we had an endless supply of mornings to scroll through cat videos on instagram or if we could spend decades trying out every career path but we don't have a limited time the conveyor belt is always moving and this fear about whether or not we are optimally loading the conveyor belt of stuff is why millions of people buy time management books like this one and watch productivity nerds like me giving advice here on youtube and what most time management gurus say that in theory it is in fact possible to fit everything in provided you have the perfect time management system but when i read 4000 weeks and i spoke to oliver on my deep dive podcast he had big problems with this whole line of thinking well the most the most stereotypical book is going to imply that you can get everything done that is important to you whether it's ambitions and goals or sort of obligations and demands all of it provided that you render yourself sufficiently optimized and efficient and so that you can sort of pack in more and more and more into the same amount of time that you won't need to make tough choices with what you do about your time and that if and that you can sort of achieve a kind of control over your day that is basically absolute and i kind of want to say no you don't even have time for all the things that matter and that's the truth here and what we discovered in a rock experiment that we genuinely don't have time for all of the important things that matter to us but most of us find this kind of hard to accept and we tell ourselves that we can cram everything in probably at some point in the future the philosopher henri bergson summed it up like this the future appeals more to us than the present moment because it appears to us in a multitude of pleasant forms all at the same time basically it's easier to stay in a fantasy world believing that all of our dreams could hypothetically come true in the future than it is to make hard decisions about which goals to invest in and which ones to ignore given that we actually can't get everything done this was my rationale when i decided to go for medicine as a university degree rather than computer science i had all these tech and entrepreneurial aspirations but i didn't want to close the door on those and i also liked the idea of being a doctor and i don't want to close the door on that so i thought oh if i do medicine it keeps my options open i'll be able to do all of the things which is a decision that did end up working but it really feeds into this whole narrative that we have as a society that we should be doing lots and lots of things with our time now let's take a closer look at exactly how we go into denial about what we can actually get done given that we have limited time and we use two main coping mechanisms to keep ourselves living in the present moment uh clearing the decks and submitting to distraction let's talk about clearing the decks first now this is when we put off big tasks that are important to us like getting ripped or learning a language or writing a book and we instead try to clear the decks of all of these small but urgent tasks that we just need to get out of the way first because we think the big stuff needs our full focus but the thing is that those annoying little tasks never actually go away the more mindless work that we get through the more mindless work ends up back on our desks and months can go by with us answering thousands and thousands of emails and bashing through these little work tasks but making no real progress on our big scary goals because quote the time isn't quite right this is basically procrastination it's this huge scale version of telling ourselves that we will get to work but only once we've cleaned our desk we do it so that we don't have to face up to the fact that a we don't have time to do all of the things that actually matter and b that we might fail at or be disappointed in those things that we choose to do and to be honest sometimes work actually is that distraction from what really matters like when we're worried about not getting everything done our second big coping mechanism is submitting to distraction now people discuss online distraction quite a lot and yes algorithms and stuff are pretty good at getting you hooked on things like youtube and instagram and twitter but the truth is that most of us are actually willing accomplices in our own distraction and in the moment we are very very happy to be distracted even if we know we're gonna feel bad about it later and this is how oliver puts it in four thousand weeks he writes that distractions are not the ultimate cause of our distraction although well-engineered they are ultimately just the place we go to to seek relief from the discomfort of facing our limitations distractions don't have to just be clickbait like with clearing the decks your whole job can be a distraction or anything else like maybe a relationship or life obligations that you sort of half enjoy but you don't really see as truly meaningful and in those cases what we're running from is the discomfort of what really matters and we're afraid of those big goals that we might not have the time for or the ones that we might actually fail to achieve so what is the solution according to oliver well he reckons that when we embrace our limits uh we stop endless procrastination and we really start living in the real world and it all comes down to this thing embracing your limits and conveniently he recommends three main steps for this the first step to embracing our limits is to accept defeat basically we should embrace the fact that we can't get everything done and that there's absolutely no cure for this and this is really the big insight that can set us free like once we realize that we're actually setting the bar way too high and that we are expecting to get everything done and it's actually not possible to do that we can let then all of our superman ambitions and all that stuff crash to the ground and then we can actually start doing the things that matter right so the second way we can embrace our limits is by rediscovering wonder i feel like most of us have this low level annoyance that our life is so short compared to infinity it's like we feel weirdly entitled to live forever at least that's how we act but instead of trying to cram absolutely everything into our 4000 weeks and resenting the fact that we don't live longer or resenting the fact that we don't have so much time it makes more sense to kind of reset and compare the time that we do have to the more likely scenario of just not existing at all now oliver's got a story of this chap whose friend david suddenly died unexpectedly that man was used to getting annoyed when he was stuck in traffic or queueing in the supermarket but after his friend sadly tragically passed away instead he found himself wondering what would david have given to be caught in this traffic jam and then feeling weirdly calm he shifted his focus from what he was actually doing and started appreciating the fact that he actually got to do anything in the first place now oliver says that once we rediscover this kind of wonder about life we start to see just existing itself as this like incredible coincidence that we get to enjoy instead of it being this tiny amount of time that never feels like it's enough and then the third way of embracing our limits is to find meaning infinitude arguably things get their meaning from the fact that we have limited time here on earth and if we did apparently have an infinite life then there wouldn't be any reason to do anything we could just always just do it later and nothing would really matter at the end of the day university for example probably wouldn't feel special if you knew that you could stay for an extra 50 years and we probably wouldn't care as much about events like christmas or birthdays or families or whatever if we knew that we could always just do that a little bit later so once we've shifted our perspective a bit and embraced our limits we can move on to the six practical steps for being more intentional with our time the first action point is to practice doing nothing this is something i'm very bad the idea is that we should sit down set a timer and literally just practice doing nothing and whenever you find yourself thinking and like focusing on your breathing and all these other techniques then you try and stop and return to a feeling of neutrality this means we want to resist the urge to manipulate our experience or the people around us and practice just kind of letting things be oliver says that if you can't bear doing nothing for more than a few minutes you are likely to make very poor choices with your time and rush into commitments just to feel busy i think this is something that i definitely struggle with and i'm definitely going to try and work on this year now point two is to rediscover rest basically we should stop treating leisure time as if it's a means to an end like it's just a way to relax before work or a way to recharge our batteries for work and we should even try and stop seeing our leisure time as time that we can cram in loads of side hustles and stuff ideally we want to try and enjoy our down time as an end in itself we want to do stuff that we enjoy that has no clear end goal or future purpose some of the time maybe going for a slow walk or even playing video games but as genuine hobbies not just as a distraction from reality and this is why i'm kind of getting back into playing playstation 5 and why i've downloaded elden ring because i'm trying to be more intentional about enjoying a sort of leisure that doesn't really have a future i don't know economic payoff which is the thing that i personally struggle with sometimes this is a bit like mindfulness to be honest like letting ourselves feel fulfilled in the moment instead of constantly putting off just being content one thing you can do maybe is choose a hobby that doesn't have that much social status attached to it like playing video games or building model railways or whatever it is that people do or even doing something that we enjoy like for me it's playing guitar or playing piano even though i'm not very good at it and even though there's no way in hell i'm ever going to be world class at the thing because then you kind of know that you're strictly doing it for your own enjoyment rather than as extrinsically motivated to do it as a means to an end now the third action step that you can do is pay yourself first most of us try to fit in our own stuff at the end of the day once all of our other work and family and other commitments are out of the way but as we know there are way too many important things that are always going to end up draining our time and we need to learn to pay ourselves first with our own time now a simple way of doing this is to do our most important activity the thing that we're doing for ourselves rather than for our work doing that is the first thing in the morning like working on writing a book or going to the gym or having quality family time this is why i've just introduced a new rule in the business that every employee every person in our 20 man team has to spend the first hour of every single day working on their own personal project and we as a business pay them to spend that first hour of their working day on a personal project something that advances their own personal goals because like you actually probably don't want to give the best hour of your day to your employer even if you really enjoy your work and i hope everyone here does fingers crossed but you probably want to give that best hour to your own personal projects and if you're interested we are actually hiring a bunch of people for the team link down below to our jobs page if you happen to be based in london so yeah you know as oliver says we need to remember that we do need to make tough decisions about spending our time instead of indefinitely putting our life on hold in the hope that at some point in the future time will be free up now overall this is sort of a productivity book it's in the productivity sort of self-help genre and actually a lot of the ideas in this book really resonated with me and vibe with a lot of the stuff that i have talked about in some of my online classes about productivity which you can find over at skillshare who are very kindly sponsoring this video if you haven't heard by now you must have heard by now skillshare is an incredible platform with thousands and thousands of classes from all sorts of things from like productivity to youtube to video editing to cooking to graphic design to interior design all sorts of really cool stuff you can learn on skillshare and if you sign up to skillshare you can actually access all of the 12 i think online classes that i have on skillshare three of them i themed around productivity and how to get more done while being kind of it being sustainable and being fun and not being too burnt out uh so you might like to check those out i also have a whole class about youtube for beginners if you're interested in what it takes to make video videos just like this one this class will take you through the entire process of like starting a channel from scratch and like making your first video and all that kind of stuff and loads of people have found that really helpful as a way of getting started with youtube if any of that sounds up your street or you want to check out more of my stuff on skillshare or all of their other stuff on skillshare then head over to the link

biggest platform that i host like loads and loads and loads of my own online courses on so thank you skillshare for sponsoring this video now the fourth action step is pretty closely linked to paying yourselves first and that is deciding when to fail oliver says that we need to realize that we are going to fail about some things that genuinely matter to us and we should do this intentionally and fully accept the consequences firstly we should identify all the stuff that we have to do like paying our bills and paying our taxes and our mortgages and all that stuff picking up the kills kids from school cooking food all that kind of stuff the stuff that we have to do and we separate that out from the rest of the stuff and we know that no matter what this stuff needs to absolutely has to get done secondly we want to accept that all of the other niggly little urgent tasks like cleaning the house or doing the laundry or answering emails replying to people on whatsapp all of that stuff will always be there and we want to decide where we where we want to just do the bare minimum maybe you can do what i do and decide that you're going to forget about cooking and just get takeaway every night and occasionally try to cook when you have the time or you can again do what i do and just accept that i'm really really bad at replying to emails and whatsapp messages and like this is a failure that i'm happy to accept because it means that i don't live my whole life kind of in constant anxiety that i've got these 18 people that i need to reply to what's up thirdly we can realize that there are an infinite number of things that we actually could care about charities people hobbies causes work sometimes you will just have to say no to cool stuff because it's going to distract you from your highest priorities and once you realize that actually a lot of the tasks on your play are actually pretty optional then you might just feel a massive sense of release and relief that you don't have all this weight of all these rocks and stuff on your shoulders so more of the story is that if you are feeling stressed find something to fail at intentionally the next point we're nearly done is to limit our work in progress we need to stop trying to get everything done at once and instead limit our work in progress and the best way of doing this is operating a two-column open and closed to-do list at least that's what oliver talks about in the book and i've actually started experimenting with this and actually works really well so the open list is for all of our possible tasks and to-do's and projects we want to write down absolutely everything and it's going to be ridiculously long but then what we do is that we feed our most important tasks into the closed list where crucially we're only allowed to have a maximum of 10 things on that closed list and the main thing is that we want to try and focus on what is the actually important stuff in our life knowing all the rest is just going to be there somewhere on the open list and then crucially we are only allowed to move something up into the closed list when we have gotten rid of something or we have completed something from the list itself so the list is only ever allowed to have a certain number of items oliver suggests 10 items which works kind of nicely and really the point of this two-prong system is that we can accept that when it comes to stuff on the open list we might just not do it or we might fail at it and that is totally point the whole point is about prioritizing and then the final action point that oliver recommends is serialized serialized serialized even once you've got your closed list try to serialize your work by focusing on one big project at a time until you complete it or choosing one work project and one personal project it doesn't really matter the whole idea of this is that like if we actually are choosing the thing that's highest priority and just focusing on that we don't need to do 18 things at once because only one of those is going to be really the highest priority thing so if we just focus on that one thing and do it one at a time rather than having all these projects in parallel then hopefully our life will become a lot less stressed out overall so those were six of the interesting action points from this book four thousand weeks but the overall message of the book is which i think is really important and really nice is that it's okay to really embrace our limits and like once we realize that we actually cannot do everything then hopefully we can start living a calmer slightly more intentional life and focusing on the handful of things that genuinely truly make us happy and make us fulfilled if you liked this episode of book club then eight you should check out the book but also you should totally listen to my full like two hour long interview with the author of oliver burkman on my deep dive podcast that'll be linked right over here thank you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next video",

            {
                "content": "- Imagine being able to pick up any book, read it, and remember almost everything from it. This kind of superpower memory recall might feel like fiction, but there are people in the real world that seem to carry an incredible ability to hold on to information and I'm definitely not one of them. I've read hundreds of books, blogs, and newsletters, but my ability to recall any of it is terrible. So I decided to finally look into this blind spot, to learn about how the smartest people in the world remember information and to uncover their systems so I can use them for myself. This video is brought to you by Squarespace, I'll talk more about them later in the video. If I were to show you a non-fiction book that you've read over the past year, whether it was for school, work, or your own personal development, how likely are you to be able to remember five facts from the book? How well could you explain the book to someone else? All right, let me give this a try for myself. \"Steal Like An Artist\" being creative means getting inspired by other people and you should steal like an artist. It's really a book about- (lip trills) I just read this book so this one's a little bit unfair. What else was it? What else was in this book? Great ideas are really simple and clear. I think that's all I got. I can't even remember one of the 48 laws. I just read it, I just read this book like a month ago. There's not much of a point of reading non-fiction books, particularly books about personal development if you're not actually going to absorb and implement the insights, but remembering everything might be a bit of a stretch for the average person. After some research, I discovered that our ability to remember things varies wildly from person to person. Some have terrible memories, others exceptional, and even others have photographic memories. As you might have guessed, the average memory is body, messy, and often unreliable. It's easier for us to remember events that provide a deviation from our typical sensory experience. Like getting hit in the face with a ball, that interesting thing you learned from that self-help book, not so much, but my question is can we change that? I knew exactly who I needed to speak with. I read online that you've read over 3,000 books is that true? - I don't know, I think it's probably bad form to count, you know, like with the romantic partners. - I don't know about you, but that number, well, it wouldn't take me very long to add up. Ryan Holiday is the international bestselling author of great books like \"The Obstacle Is the Way\" and \"Ego Is the Enemy\" and while I can't remember much of what I read in these books, I do remember them being really good. Ryan, thanks so much for being here. - Of course. - [Matt] One of the things that I was struck by when I first interviewed Ryan back in 2019, was his memory recall. He pulled quotes and stories effortlessly from the books that he's read over the years. - Eisenhower, he had this line, he said, \"William James talked about this. I have a quote in the intro from Blaise Pascal. Buddha and Marcus Aurelius and Seneca and Confucius and-\" - I seriously needed to know his secret. So I jumped on a video call with him so we could get to the bottom of it. One of the main reasons why I wanted to chat with you is because I have this problem where I read a non-fiction book and then I completely forget about everything. Like I can look at that book and be like, \"I don't remember one or two things from this book.\" How can we get better at remembering what we read and putting into practice what we read? - First off, I'd be a little kinder to yourself. Having one or two things that you take from a book, if those are important things that could change your life, you know, you paid $11 for this book like is it so bad that you only got two life changing things from it, right? So like I think sometimes people are like, \"I don't have perfect recall of the book,\" I mean, the book was supposed to take you on a journey and leave you with something. I started in publishing as a research assistant. I work for this amazing author named Robert Greene and he showed me a way of reading that I practice to this day that I think could be valuable, which is basically, as I read a book, I fold pages as I'm reading and then I make notes to myself. I'm highlighting the things that I'm liking and then what I do as a writer because I want to use a lot of this information is I then transfer the stuff that I really liked or that really impacted me and I put them on note cards and so I just write the thought that I had that it inspired or I write down the story and then I sort those note cards by theme. So I'm kind of creating like an exterior brain that organizes the stuff that I took from the books. - So I decided to put Ryan's system to the test and try it out for myself and what better book to start with than \"Courage Is Calling,\" that's Ryan's latest book by the way. All right, so I've got my tools here, highlighter, pen, my post-it bookmarks here, and a stack of note cards and, of course, my book, let's see how this works. So when you really break down Ryan's system, there are three main parts. First, take notes while you read, second, revisit and revise your notes when you're finished with the book, and third, categorize and file your notes. The reason why this kind of system is so effective at helping us retain more of what we read comes down to how our brains process information. Over time, we've developed a sorting process to help us determine what information to hold onto in our explicit memory. That's the type of long term memory that's concerned with recollection of facts and events. Thanks to what's known as heuristic memory processing, we tend to prioritize information that is frequently used, recently used, or likely to be needed to make decisions. So becoming a better learner is all about putting in the work, reading, taking notes, studying, and making use of the information that you're taking in. In other words, having a system like Ryan's and while Ryan said that he enjoys audiobooks and eBooks, he thinks that there's an advantage to going analog. - I do tend to find that people who are like, \"Oh, I listen to a lot of audiobooks or I listen to- I read a lot of eBooks,\" the recall's not there. They're like, \"I do my highlights, but they just go somewhere on my computer.\" I think there is something about getting away from the screen, sitting down, and engaging deeply with the world in front of you. (gentle music) (mug thuds) - All right, so I have completely finished reading \"Courage Is Calling\" and I have taken extensive notes throughout. So I am a slow reader in this process of taking thorough notes throughout the entire book, definitely slow me down even more probably by 30 or 40%, but the idea is that hopefully, this will make these memories and ideas just a little bit more sticky. Now, I need to go through this entire book and take all of my notes, all of the best notes that I've taken and put them down onto these note cards.

So now, that I've gotten two thirds of the way into this note taking experiment, it's become clear that this is a very slow and methodical process. If you're anything like me, this can make you feel a bit antsy, but what I continue to remind myself is that this isn't about becoming superhuman and devouring books in a day. It's about taking the time to digest the information, think critically about it, and to try to find ways to reuse and repurpose what I'm learning and really more importantly to actually enjoy the process. - Reading is a pleasurable activity, I enjoy doing it and so you would never hear someone be like, \"Dude, I have the fastest sex you would not believe it,\" right? Or like, \"You should see how fast I can scarf down food at this fancy restaurant.\" I'm having a conversation with Ernest Hemingway or Marcus Aurelius or Doris Kearns Goodwin, these are like the best people in the world at what they do. I wanna enjoy that like I'm gonna take my time doing it. - So I have finished taking the best ideas, note stories, and quotes from this book and put them down onto about 20 to 30 note cards and now, is the point in the process where I need to go through and organize all this. One thing that I've realized from this process is that you don't remember things by accident, which means I need to systematize and organize all of these notes into different buckets, categories, and themes. It's probably too early to tell whether this system will improve my memory in the long run. I have a feeling I'm still gonna be on the goldfish end of the memory scale, but I've learned something even more important over the past few weeks of following this system. You actually can't remember everything you want to, you just need to store it outside of your brain. Oh, and if you're wondering whether I'll keep this up myself, maybe, but I don't know if it'll look exactly like this. I don't know how many boxes of note cards I can have at my place and still keep my sanity. How many boxes of note cards do you have? - Well, at least one for every single book that I've written, but I'm looking I have one, two, three, four, five, six, I have seven in my office right now. My system is an amalgamation combination of Rob Greene's and yours can be your own spin on mine. - [Matt] Whether you decide to follow an analog system like Ryan's or go digital, the important thing is to just get started. - You're better off starting imperfectly than being paralyzed by the hope or the delusion of perfection. My system has evolved over the years, it will continue to evolve. Maybe there's some version in the future where it does become digital, but right now, this is what works for me and the main thing is that I'm doing it always and I'm getting better as I go. - Thanks so much for watching this video, if you liked it, don't forget to hit Subscribe and especially that little Notification Bell so you get future videos from me that way you don't have to work too hard to remember to watch my videos later.

                "content": "hey everyone today i'd like to walk you through my book on a page summary for how to take smart notes a book by zenka arens and if i've heard to summarize the book in a single sentence or quote i would use this quote from zunke that every intellectual endeavor starts with a note this plus the idea of having a simple repeatable atomic workflow or the two building blocks upon which the entire book is built there's an anecdote about richard feynman when a historian walks up to his desk and sees all the sheets of paper lying around on mr feynman des and makes a comment about these being a record of feynman's thinking and then mr feman corrects the historian and says that these are not a record of my thinking i think on paper and then the historian presses on and says that surely you're thinking in your head and these are only records of the thoughts in your head and that's when mr feinman says that no they aren't a record of my thinking process they are my thinking process i actually did the work on the paper for some reason for mr feman this was an extremely important point to make that he is thinking on paper and without paper he is not able to do his thinking neil levy makes a similar observation in his book that notes do not make contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavor easier they make it possible you need to understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding and for me the takeaway from all of this is that writing is not a chore writing is part of the thinking process and you could even argue that writing is the thinking process itself so the book is about a system that was developed by a german sociologist nicholas luhmann who was quoted to say that i only do what's easy he had a system that made it easy for him to be very productive so let's see what that very productive means mr lumen was originally trained in law and he worked in the german administration and in the evenings he had a hobby to read about sociology and to make notes and as he was doing it he started to develop a system which he called a zettel costan and zettel means a slip of paper with notes and custom means a slip box a set of drawers with the cards inside he was discovered based on one of his articles and eventually he became the professor of sociology and over his lifetime he published close to 60 books and 600 articles many of them bringing completely new and fresh perspectives to his field and overall he created about 90 000 notes and of those about 1200 for index entries he had 600 manuscript outlines and he also had a separate box for his literature notes which he had about 15 000. if you think about it 90 000 seems a lot but just counting workdays so not counting weekends this is an average of six notes per day so the volume of knowledge that mr lumen accumulated is actually a very doable volume of work if you just take notes every day consistently so let's look at how these slips look like he had multiple types of slips and we are going to talk about it in quite some detail later on but just to give you an idea you can see two types here the one right here this is a permanent note and permanent notes contained a single idea they contained some references and he had a clever numbering system that we're going to talk later on so each note had an id and this one here is a literature note on the back side of this sheet you would see the bibliographical reference and on this side you can see the page number and you can see a couple of words jotting down what's important or what caught his attention on that page thinking about mr lumen's productivity you can think about this simple process that to write a good paper you just need to rewrite a good draft and to have a good draft you just need to turn a series of notes into continuous text and if you think about it a series of notes is just the rearrangement of notes you already have in your slip box thus all you really need to do is to have a pen in your hand when you read and to take notes before diving into the process i think the last bit i want to highlight is this idea that the notes are the shipping containers of ideas for you to understand how this relates to note taking let's just talk a bit about container shipping there were multiple attempts at introducing container shipping but there were many failed attempts and it only succeeded when there was an end-to-end standardization in the industry meaning standardization in the factories in trucking in the cranes and the harbor the ships and also the warehouses every step of the supply chain had to be adjusted to work with the standard shipping container once that happened it all became significantly more efficient and if you think about it this is a bit counterintuitive because if you are a ship owner the traditional way of putting goods on the ship made better use of space on the ship however if you think about the end-to-end value chain it is quite obvious that the shipping container has changed the world has changed the industry has really brought supply chain to a global level an important idea here is that less choice drives more focus and drives more productivity in terms of note taking this is using a single format one idea per note being selective brief and precise in your notes and following a simple and consistent workflow and in the end this level of standardization drives creativity because you don't need to use your mental energies to think about the process you can simply focus on the act of writing and connecting your ideas so let's dive a bit deeper into all of this before going into the process and walking you through the process and then walking you through some of the details of how this process works i wanted to give you a bit of a comparison at a glance to compare the status quo process with the settle casting process and explain you some of the differences and then we can dive into the process and the further details so the status quo and this is what you will find in many of the books about academic writing is about finding the topic then doing your research finding literature doing some reading and taking notes drawing conclusions outlining your text writing you might be lucky or not by hitting or missing your deadline and once you're ready you file everything away and you start the whole process with an empty sheet of paper all over again compared to this the settle casting approach goes in a bit of a different way so your main work is reading thinking and understanding and coming up with ideas that's what you do every day every time you have an idea you know that down and you know then your ideas your arguments your quotes with bibliographical references by this you create this web of notes that are important to you and when the time comes you look at these notes you assemble existing nodes into a sequence based on that you create your rough draft you create your final paper and you publish so instead of a top-down approach where you think about a topic you look for content and then you develop your paper you work bottom up you read you find interesting ideas and then sufficient number of ideas accumulate then you make it into a draft and the final paper and you publish it so why is the slipbox approach better than the status quo when you're thinking it doesn't feel productive you're staring out the window you're thinking thoughts and while that's a very important activity it doesn't feel productive and because you want to feel productive you will look for some instant gratification and maybe go and wash the dishes or do something else the benefit of the slip box approach is it gives you an atomic workflow that will help you feel productive in this thinking process because you will be taking individual notes you're going to be creating links comparing those notes with your existing notes it will have small atomic steps that will make you feel productive also compared to the status quo or traditional approach you have a goal and maybe that goal is daunting it it will dishearten you that you need to write 100 pages and you're not making progress it will feel awful that you're missing your goal in the settle casting you focus on the workflow and you refine your workflow and the workflow has very short cycle time so your feedback about moving forward is there and then if you trust the system that you do each of the workflow steps repeatedly it will build something in the end that is very valuable you build on this compounding value of ideas and that difference is a very important distinction between the status quo and the zettelkasten approach in the status quo taking notes is just one activity among the many in settle constant only the ideas that you've written down count it is the fundamental building block of the entire settle custom approach in the status quo approach you think about the topic top down and then you search for literature which you will find or not and the literature will support your thesis or not in the settle constant you will have already accumulated notes you look at those notes and based on the number of notes you have on certain topics topics will emerge and therefore it's a bottom up approach but also because these ideas emerge from the material you know that you already have notes on the subject so you're definitely not going to be starting with an empty sheet of paper while in the status quo approach the questions are brainstorm the approach is brainstormed and i'll talk a bit later about brainstorming being outdated in the settle custom categories emerge you read different things based on your interest you make connections and as you do this categories will emerge from your work in the status quo ideas are compartmentalized so if you want to research a subject you look for books in that subject you read those books and you're really not expanding the field because you only look for items within that category and you're creating a new article or a new book in that category there is no cross-disciplinary connections that you would be making in the central custom because of this emergent approach you have this very strong interlink between various different subjects in the status quo you're creating an r hive maybe if you write a lot then you create a large archive but it is not connected it is compartmentalized it's very hard to use in the zettol casting you create an externalized system to think in you create this scaffolding for your thinking process the benefit of the settle casting system as i already mentioned with the shipping container is that it's highly standardized it's repeatable it's simple in the status quo it's different approaches sources different formats you might be making underlines in the books and writing some notes on the side you might be creating paper notes and you have your notes and ideas all over the place in different formats the settle casting is process oriented and i mentioned it up here avid washing the dishes that if you focus on the workflow that is a much more motivating approach than if you have a goal-oriented approach and you set a challenging goal that you are not able to achieve or that takes extremely long time to achieve then your progress is going to be stalled eventually you will lose momentum so those are some of the reasons why overall the slip box approach is better it's a bottom-up approach it's a process-based approach and it focuses on writing each of your thoughts down so let's look at the process in a bit more detail so here i have this process flow of what you do in a settle casting system it all begins with when you have an idea make a note of it a fleeting note is something that you can write on a paper napkin even it is just a reminder of a thought zenke stresses that you should review your fleeting notes once a day while you're still remembering the context take your fleeting notes place them in an inbox once you process your fleeting note it goes into the vase pin so you're not using the fleeting notes later on what goes into the inbox will be filtered so you want to create permanent notes and bibliographical notes but you want to be very selective this is a very interesting takeaway for me from zinke's book he talks about the importance of forgetting in remembering there are many approaches about improving our memory but it turns out and you'll need to read the book to see all the examples that zenka brings in that there's research to prove that we have quite some serious infrastructure in our minds to inhibit remembering if you were to remember everything then you would have an extremely hard time to select what's important and indeed there are some people who have difficulty forgetting and that is a major disability so in terms of making a valuable system you don't want to capture hundreds of notes each day as i mentioned here with mr lumen his average was six notes per day so that is the the target that you want to be selective you only want to capture the important ideas and when you make a note you have two types of notes you have your literature notes they go into a reference system and we looked at this literature note right here so the literature note includes page numbers and notes of what you read an important point here is that you're not copy pasting text but you're rather paraphrasing with your own words and the other side of the literature note is the bibliographic reference and then the other type of notes are these slips the permanent notes or the zeptiles in here you create one idea per note you write in full sentences and you include precise references you write these in the context of your other notes and we'll talk about this in a bit more detail later on and the way you organize your permanent notes is if the permanent note is in response to a previous one so you're working on something and there was a question that came to mind and you found the answer to that question or you're working on something and you found a good example to demonstrate that concept and these are notes that would go directly behind the previous note if there is no note that is being referenced you just put the new note at the end of the notes you add links to other notes to your notes and you also create an index and your index should only have a couple of entry points into your note system and again we'll talk about this index a bit later so here you can see the different type of nodes so overall we have three type of cards we talked about the literature notes the index notes are special type of notes that give you entry point into a certain topic this is where you can start to navigate your settle casting and then you have the permanent notes that build on one another both of these are good explanations mr lumen had a clever numbering system of numbers and letters and that using these numbers and letters and commas he was able to create sequences of notes and he was also able to create branches of his thoughts so he had this trail of thought and then he could branch off into different directions and he could do that by doing this numbering system so in this case you can see that after 3d7 i have 3d 8 continuing on on this trail of thoughts and 3d 9 and 10 and here i have 7a and then 7a1234 going off in this direction if you're interested to understand this numbering system and to see how these nodes branched off in real life i recommend that you visit this site so this is the nicholas lumen archive and here you find all of his zettel's scanned in if you turn on google translate it will automatically translate the german site to your own language and there you can navigate lumens numbering system and you can see how these branching off works the bottom line is you create these hierarchies of nodes and here's a point i want to highlight which was something that wasn't trivial to me and i actually didn't learn this from the book i'm sure this is also mentioned in the book but i was listening to an interview with zenke where he highlighted this in response to a question that the big difference between a personal wikipedia and the zettel costing system is that the zettel custom system has a hierarchical node structure meaning it is not just that you link items to one another and and there's this web of thoughts that is true so you have cross-references between notes but you distinguish between two types of references you have the hierarchical reference which takes you from one idea to the next to the next going deeper in that idea and then you have your cross-references which interlink related ideas with one another and this also helps you so this was a question in my mind okay i accumulate notes but what does it mean that topics emerge and that i can identify that the topic has emerged so in this case you can actually visually identify looking at the length of the note sequence you know the number of thoughts you have in that area and these clusters emerge by the way that was a good feature of mr lumen's numbering system because just simply looking at the structure of the number you knew how deep and where you are in the tree and that already gave you a good understanding if this topic had many notes or only a few notes to it in terms of the type of permanent nodes there were a couple of special type of permanent notes that mr lumen used so he had overview notes i colored these the location of them in the sequence is just for a demonstration purpose completely arbitrary but the point is that the overview notes cover a topic so then you have sufficient number of notes on a topic you might want to create an overview note that lists a set of entry points there you have couple of words and then a link to a note and this is like a table of contents or a map of contents for that topic he also had summary notes which are similar to overview notes but a they are less important and they cover a cluster of notes in a similar manner you get a an overview of what's in that cluster of notes so overall just to recap where we are so you took your fleeting node you went through this filtering process you created a node for an important idea and then you filed it in your permanent notes in the note hierarchy as well as if required you created a literature note for it so you can have that reference but you kept that reference separately and with that you have these topics emerging this is where it becomes interesting when it comes time to write something to publish about something the old approach is called brainstorming which is surprisingly often used and recommended still today you use your memory to come up with some ideas to write about or topics to write about instead of this the emergent approach is much superior and i talked about this already earlier that in this case you look for topics where you have notes accumulated the issue with the top-down approach is you decide on the research topic you start to do your research and you might find yourself in a conflict of interest situation where your research is proving to disprove the point that you're writing about but you're under pressure to finish your work so in the end you're writing about something that is no longer relevant to you and you get into this negative spiral of writing stuff that really doesn't interest you that much here the idea is no one ever starts from scratch so when you start to write something you don't start with a blank sheet of paper you select the set of notes you want to write about and you organize these into a sequence of notes because the issue with the notes in your settle casting is there might be circularly referencing each other they are branching off it's not a linear story when you write a book it has to be linear in the end so that's the first stats that you selected your notes you put them in a sequence and once you have that sequence then you can write your rough draft proofread your manuscript and you can publish as you are doing this you will also create some project notes in a way there are three types of notes and maybe let me just mention it at this point so we have the fleeting notes we have the project notes and we have the permanent notes these are the three big categories of notes and project notes are things like comments in the manuscript or outlines they can be to-do lists at the end of the project you can either decide to archive these or to discard these this is up to you however as you're doing your research as you're doing your organization of notes and you might have some additional question and doing some additional research inevitably you will come up with ideas you will encounter ideas in the process that are not directly related to your research and that is when the settle constant becomes extremely powerful because a you feed these back as fleeting notes and they go into your system so you're able to work on parallel topics in fact zenke encourages us to work on multiple topics at the same time also i think the idea is that the byproducts and products of our work in one topic become inputs for another so this chart down here tries to explain this concept that in a production line and this can be of course a production like like in manufacturing but also this is now your thinking production line the byproduct of one production line becomes the resource for another which again has byproducts and becomes a resource for another so i have my original idea or literature here i do my processing it has a by-product it also has a product that i ship so this is my publication that i publish and it has a by-product which is some ideas that came up during that work and this plus some other reading i've done i process into another product which i ship and again the whole process continues so this your your projects become this interlinked activities where nothing really falls on the ground you're reusing the knowledge that you have created and this is why this arrow here is important because when you're working on the project you don't throw away other ideas you keep them you store them you work them into your process with this this is the core workflow there are a couple of pitfalls and then we are going to look at some best practices for each of the activities so some of the common pitfalls that you want to be mindful of is if everything is a permanent note then it will dilute the value of your zettel costume because this is back to the point about forgetting is an important skill if you want to be able to remember if everything is a project note and that is the feature for example of the status quo approach as well then you're always back to square one you don't reuse knowledge from the previous processes or at least you don't have an efficient way to do that and if everything is a fleeting node then you get into this vicious cycle of a growing pile of notes and then you'll have this urge after couple of months to clear the house your throw out all your notes and then you start from nothing and this cycle will repeat but again you're losing important knowledge you're losing important thoughts so let's look at some of the best practices that you want to pay attention to and these are following the logic of the process the first set of ideas are about the importance of reading for understanding so your goal when you're reading is to enrich your slip box and you typically can do this by looking for information that this confirms your ideas that are opposing views or that contradicts corrects or maybe supports and adds to your ideas but the way to enrich your slip box is to deliberately look for ideas that are different than yours otherwise you're really not learning the other idea here is to practice every day so this activity of writing your ideas down is like piano practice for a pianist you do it every day it's a repeating activity of extracting the gist of the text and writing it down and as you do this more and more you'll get better and better at it finally your focus should be on distillation and not on quantity being able to reframe questions and assertions is even more important than having extensive knowledge because without this ability you would never be able to put the knowledge to use so how do you write your notes how do you create your permanent notes and the idea is that your literature note captures what you read in the book or in the literature it is a short summary of the idea by the author it is in the context of the book or the source where you read it a permanent note is in the context of your other permanent notes in your zettel custom system so you write it in the context of your research of your ideas you write it such that you no longer need the original book you do make a reference if it's relevant to the source but the permanent notes are written in the context of your existing notes it follows the trail of thought it reflects and reference your existing notes in your system and with that you create notes that are now your own ideas in your own system keep in mind that these nodes should always be atomic aim to create one idea per note the next step is to develop your ideas assigning keywords is a key part of the thinking process this is when you think about what topics or what other notes are relevant if you're using tags as indexes then xenka recommends to use them sparingly because your indexes should be brief if you overuse tags then it will dilute the value of your indexes there are two types of people you have the archivists and the writers the archivist looks for the keyword that's most fitting where you can archive something this is like the librarian looking for the topic where the book belongs and the writer who's thinking about in which context do i want to stumble upon this information even if i forget it and of course for the settle casting system the writer's mentality is the better mentality so a common way to embed an idea in the context of a slip box is to write out the reasons for why it's important how does it link to your line of thought so you just write a paragraph explaining that i found this idea interesting because and you finish the sentence another approach for developing your ideas and for connecting them with other ideas in your xethel casting system is to practice seeing small differences between seemingly similar subjects or ideas and to see connections between seemingly different ideas one tool that you may want to use for this is the double bubble map that i talked about in another video this is a visual tool for comparing and contrasting two ideas albert rosenberg suggests that the construction of opposites is the most reliable way of generating new ideas in this sense the double bubble map can become a core component of your settle cast and approach where you practice this activity of seeing differences between similar concepts or connecting different concepts and finding the similarities and with generating brand new ideas it's important to think outside the brain because if you think in your brain you try to bring in different concepts and think about them then just simply holding those concepts in memory in short-term memory is going to burn up the very mental resources that you need for scrutinizing it for thinking about it comparing is one of our natural strengths so if we can see two things and we can move our eyesight between the two to compare them that is a very powerful and natural way of how our brain works so in all of this and that again just underlines the value of using a tool like the double bubble map is you externalize this thinking process and i'm going to link the double bubble map video here it's a three minute quick video explaining how the double bubble map works i think in this context it is spot on a perfect tool for this process also learn to ask questions the most difficult question to answer is this question of so what's not in the picture but there are some other questions you might want to ask i'm not going to read all of them but you can see them here on the screen the first question is about questioning your question what kind of answer can i expect from asking the question in a particular way to me this is a very important question because i firmly believe that the issue is not finding the right answer usually the issue is finding the right question that you can then answer finding the right answer is usually then the easier part before we go and talk about the limited mental resources i wanted to just have this side note about study and research and zinc writes quite extensively about this in the book i just pulled out a couple of highlights around these ideas first of all the question is do you really understand and the point is that writing a summary of what you understood is an excellent way to test if you really understood something and to confront yourself unfortunately there's a thinking fallacy that just because something is familiar that you also understand it you read it once twice three times it sounds familiar you feel you understand it but when you try to explain it to someone else it turns out that you're unable to and writing your thoughts down writing the findings of your research down in your own words will help you test yourself on this as well as help you think through and internalize what you've read studying and research is really just the flip side of the coin the long story here is that if study is research and research is study and both of them are supported by writing then you should really work as if nothing else counts than writing and we're back to the atomic activity of creating nodes and that is how the zettel costing system works so here's a point about testing being more valuable than rereading interestingly even if you don't know the right answer testing will help you internalize what you've learned more than rereading the content so self-testing is an important tool in internalizing a concept and learning it deeper these cards are similar to the cards used in the spaced repetition approaches zunker talks about elaboration versus repetition elaboration is this process that we talked about earlier of developing your ideas it is this process of building one idea on top of the other and building these sequences of ideas the difference between elaboration and repetition is that in repetition you're reading the same card over and over and you try to memorize it the focus here in case of repetition is on storage strengths and in case of elaboration it is about seeing the differences and similarities between different ideas and building this chain of ideas the advocacy of zenke is that elaboration results in deeper learning and frankly outside the artificial environment of the school system memorization is not as important elaboration and internalized understanding is very important so let's look at how we manage our mental resources and this will also talk a bit about why this whole approach works so here this section is more about why the settle casting approach works and how it goes in lock step with your mental resources your mental energies and just dives into this topic you need to understand that all your mental resources are limited there are three in particular that are mentioned in the book your attention span or focus is limited our short-term memory is limited and also our willpower our motivation is limited so let's look at each of these one by one in terms of our focus there's a big benefit of the settle casting approach because it is built up of atomic activities like reading taking a note placing that note in the settle casting system or sequencing notes for a publication or proofreading you have all sorts of different activities that require different type of attention so you might need floating attention when you are looking for the right word to express something you might need focused attention when you are proofreading something and you want to find the errors in what you're reading or you might need focus on not one thought but the whole argument when you're trying to create an outline or even when you're trying to place a note into a sequence of notes the benefit of the zether custom approach is by having these atomic activities in the workflow engage in different type of focus we can maintain our attention and focus for much longer because we are using different types of focuses and that helps in that so our short-term memory is not very good it is said that we can remember between five and ten items but there are a couple of tricks here to keep in mind and couple of features of the settle cost system so the first one is chunking and just to get started uh try to memorize this number sequence so look at it and then close your eyes and try to repeat the numbers you've seen i guess you will not get very far with the process not unless i tell you that the numbers that you saw there were five years of the world cups numbered consecutively so the first was 1958 and 1962 etc and then if you look at these numbers then you will see that the first is 1958 the second is 1962 the third is 1964. and now you only need to remember two pieces of information you need to remember the starting year and that this goes for five years and then you know the system and you can write down the entire system and this is what chunking is about so while it is true that it's five to seven items that we can hold in our minds if we have conceptual models that integrate a number of different concepts then those will occupy a single slot of the five to seven short-term memory slots and that will help us in a way extend our mental capacity so chunking learning mental models is an important way of improving your short-term memory or addressing this resource gap the other aspect of short-term memory is that open tasks also occupy short-term memory so bloomer zaygarnick observed this phenomena they were out for lunch with a group of people and the waiter was extremely good at remembering who ordered what and was very friendly after they paid they left the restaurant and bloom had to go back a couple of minutes later and the vater who performed extremely well just couple of minutes ago didn't even recognize her and this started her thinking in this subject and she discovered that indeed when the task closed when the waiter collected the pay for the dinner or the lunch he was able to clear this stable these gas from his short-term memory and move on to the next table and this way conserve short-term memory so in a similar way the settle constant is consisting of small atomic activities and each of them you can complete in couple of minutes this is not multitasking so multitasking is stepping from one activity to another without really completing those activities it's being distracted by social media by an email by a phone call by someone walking up to your desk by someone interrupting you or jumping from one topic to another even though people who are multitasking so there was a test and there's some longer discussion about this in the book where people who multitask were compared to people who do not multitask on a comparative test so the activity was the same people who multitasked felt much more productive but in measurable actual fact their productivity decreased a lot so multitasking is not good however the small tasks that are involved in the settle casting system are all individually all encompassing so writing a note takes couple of minutes you finish it it's done you don't need to return to it there's no switching cost in terms of mental resources it actually helps free up short-term memory and it is a productive approach whereas multitasking is not and then finally this self-control and motivation being a limited resource and this is where the standardization approach of the settle custom comes in i guess we are back to this point about the notes or the shipping containers of ideas the the point is that by always using the same notebook the same note format the same process for storing your ideas and by reducing the number of decisions you need to make it it just makes the flow better the flip side of this that if you lack structure it makes it much more challenging to stay focused on a topic for an extended period of time so the other aspect of self-control motivation willpower is that you should follow the path of least resistance so it's the easiest to do self-control when you're doing what you want to do most this means that you should always work on the projects that are most important to you that are most interesting to you and the settle casting process will ensure that your ideas accumulate this is where i would want to point back to this comment by mr luman that i only do what's easy he was always focusing on the topic that was important to him and you can see here this feedback loop we talked earlier about that the other ideas that you encounter during the project you place them in the settle casting system so you have a place to store those ideas you can jump from topic to topic because the system will take care of capturing those ideas just simply by collecting these notes ideas will accumulate over time i found this quote very important that even groundbreaking paradigm shifts are most often the consequence of many small moves in the right direction instead of one big idea i think this is core to the whole process that the settle casting approach the smart note taking approach is to create these steps on this staircase and in the end the compounding interest will be very significant when you look at your settle casting system and you have topics emerging that you can work on the basic idea is you should let the work carry you forward you read you take fleeting notes you create permanent notes you write down what you've read in your own words your understanding then you file them in your zettle casten system and the more connected that information it will create you the more docking places so it comes back to chunking as well the more things you can relate a piece of knowledge to the better you're going to remember that and you publish your ideas i think this is a very important point here to praise the workflow not the talent this is why sometimes the most talented students don't turn out to be the most successful because they are always praised for their talents and they never need to learn at least not in school to have efficient workflows so the workflow is much more important than talent the slip box gives you a structure of clearly separable tasks each of them can be completed in reasonable time and it provides you with instant feedback because these writing tasks are interconnected and i think that's also a very important point here that while creating a manuscript for a book for example can take up to a year the feedback cycle is very slow if you take six notes a day that's already six feedback cycles in just one day and that is just going to make a huge difference in your personal improvement so just to close all of this how do you get started a good way to start is to create a brain dump of the topics that are of most interest to you today and to note down some of the foundational thoughts you have in all of them you should keep it simple so don't get distracted by trying to create the perfect process or perfect system in the end this is an absolutely simple system you have a simple note with couple of sentences and links and you have some reference notes it is really as simple as it gets the important part is to consistently write these down and to connect them and for sure don't spend huge effort on reworking your existing notes into this system if they become important later on you will anyway reference them and move them in here if not then you saved that effort hopefully you found this overview helpful this is an extremely rich book even though this was a long video and a long summary trust me i'm just scratching the surface it was a very hard one-pager to create because of the rich content i've learned so much and i've started to apply zettel costin for my own workflow as well in a couple of weeks or months i'm going to share about some of my settle costs and approaches i would be very interested in your implementation of zettel costan and maybe some of the questions that you have after reading the book what's unclear or how have you modified this approach to fit your workflow the best thank you for your attention and until next time",

                "content": "but I wanted to welcome you all to this interview and Q&A with the author hopefully with the author of how to take smart notes a really incredible book on note-taking and really much more learning productivity personal growth project management that I've had the pleasure of kind of being deeply immersed in the past few months we're gonna take an hour I have a hard stop with a call in the next hour so we're going to ask some key assuming he shows up a few questions actually quite a number of questions that you've all sent in which I have in front of me here really really excellent questions this sort of impetus for this call was an article that I wrote summarizing the book if someone has the link to that and could drop it in the chat I'd appreciate it there we go I see you some key I'll unmute you here welcome I'm just doing a short introduction okay oh I should be unmuted okay great and by the way how do you pronounce your name is it is a sulky son good oh wow okay Zuka okay is that better that sounds great okay perfect I have a I have an unusual name for him live speakers as well so I am provide but yeah so a few a few orientation notes here as we get started first is the chat if you click the chat button in the your toolbar your zoom toolbar you'll notice a window pop up on the side we actually encourage a back-channel on these calls you can drop in comments their questions links to other resources that we mention or even though we don't mention I encourage you to introduce yourself there's some really really fascinating people on this call so definitely have the chat transcript active and I'll share that chat transcript - any private messages so don't feel like you have to write down any links or references or book titles I will share all of that with you you can just listen and then the second thing is we actually really encourage you to turn on your camera turn on your webcam if you have one and if you can it's really helpful for for both of us to kind of see the variety of people we have see your faces see the reactions whether it's excitement or boredom in response to what we're saying we can kind of respond in real-time that's the benefit of these live calls and it's the reason we do though I see we have people from all over the world I'm even going to try to read out the the names we had over a thousand people registered for this call which is pretty incredible really really cool so let's get started here is okay I wonder if you could give us your your stock what do you do like how do you describe your work I know you have your hand in various things but if you can kind of get tell us a little bit about the work you do in your background first of all thank you for having me and I'm excited about the interest that's really great and I'm working at the University in Essen in Germany at the moment and my main field is philosophy of education I worked on philosophy of signs as well so that's what I've written is a little bit informed by that so I'm interested in thinking outside the brain and I'm more interested in how to use tools for building up complex ideas I know I put an emphasis on the book on being very productive and writing a lot but I think my main interest is really in how to think better and yeah that's what I think about most of the time okay excellent and could you say a bit about your coaching a few people were curious what your coaching is like whether they can be coached by you is that something that that is yeah yeah it's not my main field at the moment so I have little time for that in there only a few slots and I my background is in systems therapy so I do counseling but online coaching at the moment more or less exclusively on the subtle Caston but in the future if I'm less busy with teaching of the University I'm certainly will do a relaunch of my website then offer a little bit more background information on that so if you subscribe to my mailing list I will keep you updated on things like this okay if someone wouldn't mind grabbing the link to zone Ches website and sticking it in the chat or as link if you have it available I'd appreciate that this is a collaborative exercise that where we all we all contribute as you can see okay it's very interesting so let's see I want to had a couple question I want to ask a couple questions right here at the beginning what tell us a little bit about so we know a little bit about your background how about the background of this book among all the things you're doing what what led you to think to think this was really important necessary and what was the what was the story that led to its creation right well it's partly a procrastination project so I was working on my next book which is still in the making and I struggled with finding the right tools and in a way it's ironic because I worked on the theory of Niklas Luhmann for quite a while and I never took his practical work with settle cast in that series and that is until I really discovered that a certain way of thinking and being much more serious about thinking outside the brain and decentralizing the mind and trying to use technology and tools to improve the level of complexity that this is something that is really interconnected with the theory itself and of course I tinkered around with different ways of writing taking notes and my hope is that I can spare people a lot of these mistakes I made and hopefully encourage people to take more notes because just taking more notes makes a huge difference I do think that a certain level of challenging yourself and your ideas require some kind of external brain and that is something I thought a lot in my teaching because teaching is a lot about okay how can you challenge assumptions how can you challenge students how can you challenge yourself and you don't always have someone around who challenges you and taking notes can help you a lot with especially going against confirmation bias it reminds you of what you're actually thinking and it forces you to make it more explicit so my main hope was to provide people with improved system that can prove thank you and helps to make things easier long the way because a lot of the struggles I had in my early days of writing is just finding things again and [Music] remembering how I thought about something and only when you can compare notes you can really see a difference because your brain always adjusts to your current state of thinking so that was a main idea and I also hoped to spark some discussion on how we organize higher education because I think that higher education is still very much screamed blind along old ideas of you have to have a plan in hand you have to come up with an hypothesis first and then you do the work and this is a certain way of thinking about thinking that I believe is just plain wrong and [Music] technology can help with implementing a more open-ended process that is more open to change and so if technology can help in that way to to spark a discussion about how to maybe change various things in higher education that that would be great a nice side effect yeah gosh I couldn't agree more oh and amen to that yes do you teach the shell casin system in your classes do you train your students in them or do they kind of have to discover it outside of class well I know one of the questions you sent me earlier that one of your viewers asked was well how do you convince students to use of the system or to write more notes and that's a tough one because the students are really know the value of a proper note-taking system are usually those who are in the final exams and have the challenge of writing the thesis and wish they had started earlier the scenes he just starts so for those who would it would be the best thing to use and usually have this mentality from school where you get some kind of packages and just take boxes and don't really grasp the importance of note-taking and if you as a professor tell them that's really important they usually think well I'm not going to be professor and write books maybe that's a little bit too much so my solution is bring older and young students together and let older students explain the importance of Melcher students because they are much more believable and they know the struggles that come later and they can explain to those who just start well it really is an advantage if you start early and if you adjust the system along the way it's not so important to have a perfect system just write and write a lot and so some of the tutors are just great in doing that so these are the ways of convincing students to take more notes yeah oh I like it I like it reminds me of that exercise in with investing where if you make people hunched over and shuffle and sort of act like they're old or feel like what it's like to be old then suddenly they want to invest more they want to save more they want to put money into their retirement accounts it's like you're linking their present and their future self and that changes behavior yeah I like that a lot okay as you so you mentioned you you went from from from Nikolas lumens outputs his content work to his practical system as you did that what surprised you as you really researched and got into the details of the cell cast was there anything that really kind of surprised you in that well I'm not sure there are many surprises it's it's more that I'm still pretty much in or about the kind of output yeah I I mean there are theoretical questions so I'm still interested in how the technology you use shapes your thinking and the kind of theory you can develop from there but I think the main surprises that are many surprises really the way it's described and there is no hidden secret so that's maybe the main surprise yeah I noticed there's so many other questions it was like you know such detailed questions about the very specific steps exactly how you do them and it's kind of like it's it feels like people trying to reverse-engineer you know a potion this magical potion if they can just get the proportions just right yeah but yes [Music] well I I know the there is a lack of step-by-step descriptions and I fully understand that this is a neat and I will certainly provide something like that and now the important part is seeing as I'm fully convinced about a software that is lasting that is fully developed where I can wholeheartedly recommend to use it because you can only do a step-by-step description when you have made a decision on the technology years or the software years I mean you don't need a step-by-step description more than which is available when you write with pen and paper because the steps huh there and there aren't too many um having said that I think there could be a misunderstanding about trying to follow a step-by-step process because first of all you need to adjust it to your own needs and the book is not only read by academics in the social sciences but many are interested who work in very different fields and you need to adjust to that and my main recommendation at the moment with this software as it is is well stick with the things you're most comfortable with and don't try to set up a whole new system because you you might end witching systems again and again and the switching cost there so it might make sense to stick with ya and see what really works for you and where you put the emphasis really depends on your kind of work so academics certainly have much more on the reference system and the literature notes and that's not hugely important when you develop ideas about your business so I would put there a much more emphasis on your project folders and your project notes and be okay with hierarchy hierarchy is no problem it just shouldn't be hardwired into the system but you can be much more hierarchical with topics and subtopics when you have a clear idea about what your projects are and that it's not true for many who more business-oriented have a clear idea about the content they want to use so you need to adjust it a bit and that's why I think it at least was important in the beginning to really explain the principles and ideas behind the system and make clear where it is different to the usual ways of writing and note-taking so the moment you understand the principles you are in a very good position to build something that is your own and works for you I think that works much better than trying to copy a style that is maybe not really your field couldn't agree more is so much of what you just said parallels my experience I mean I just I went into our our onboarding survey I think yesterday or the day before for our students and I looked at the question which note-taking app do you use and there was probably three dozen there was probably about three dozen different note-taking apps and so our approach has and to just sort of use them all and to to do sort of a brain like a mind meld a brainstorm where we bring everyone together on these zoom calls just like this and we share notes you know I like what you said about the technology does influence the way you're thinking I found that too where someone will come up with a brilliant idea because they're using some obscure note-taking app that has some feature that few others do that will then give them an insight which they can then bring back to us and we can apply to one's our own systems so so it is a bit of a challenge but I'm hoping the diversity of systems and the diversity of different kinds of technology can be can be a strength instead of a hindrance and I do think that you're right that there is a great independence of the system towards the apps you use but at the same time I do think the technology use of the software years makes a difference and maybe a Maitre one but at the moment I I can't recommend one specific that works for at least not for all the clients I talked to so I think the software doesn't make can make a huge difference and so I I also hope that the ongoing discussions and that there is a lot going on and development will have something bubble up that yeah that combines a lot of the advantages of different tools and is less archived most of the things at the moment are really for collectors not so much for thinking development it makes a huge difference if you have a low threshold of writing where you don't get distracted by the software so I'm really into everything with a little threshold and simplicity and where things don't get overboard about all the possible fine-tuning and adjustments see what's what will bubble up yeah it's an exciting time since I intend for that for this field I want to ask you one more question but then I want to get to see to two questions from others I will so just one last thing on the steps I'll put in the chat this Google Doc that I sent you some key as well which I didn't include in my original article because my article is more about the principles but I think I'll have this as an addendum to the bottom it's basically a summary of the eight steps that you outline in the book for using the subtle Caston if you want to refer to that or if someone else does that's fine but but um let's let's move on to other questions for you for example the last one I want to ask you which is what do people get wrong about the system what are the things that you notice they they commonly misunderstand misinterprets don't really get I think I'm not sure if that really fits the question but what I often see which is which was really not my intention is that people are really hard on themselves of not having a perfect system and my intention is to provide something that helps you to simplify things and make things easier and make it easier to stop when things difficult and and now I often see the search for a perfect system without struggle and it's almost like people now punishing themselves for that things are not that easy and so I would like to emphasize that writing is still difficult and of course there are always struggles with the organization and the question of where do I connect this idea to another and but that is all part of the system and in some ways there's a feedback loop so in the beginning I tended to make much too extensive notes but you realize quickly that you'd then don't really know how to address this particular note so you adjusted a bit and then the next one is maybe a bit too short and so you adjust it again and all this is not necessarily a sign that you're doing something wrong it's just a learning curve and I think it's important to embrace the difficulties in writing note-taking understanding and going through a difficult text and trying to rephrase it in your own words it's that's a challenge but they serve the challenges worse focusing on and not gay ding distracted yeah that's one of my favorite uses of these systems is if you don't know how your note-taking system should be take notes on that right on that collect ideas on that it's like this this recursive process where you can just keep going into whatever is challenging you even if it's the system itself I found that to be a very productive use of my notes let's see here okay so I have you all sent many great questions I'm going to sort of steer away from the more technology related ones because that can get into the real fine grained details of you know implementations and features and all these things also gonna be muting you all here could you provide a way to sort of some guidance on getting started for someone who has not done anything like this maybe they've taken some notes very ad hoc very randomly here and there but beyond the those eight steps that you outline what would be some of the set up or the the initial things that you would recommend people do yeah I think you shouldn't do is trying to move all your nodes into the system and spend time on that it's more about doing it differently and if you take old notes and integrated in the new system that's great but just do it when you want to use them anyway and if you feel well in the beginning there is too little possibility to connect notes then try to make explicit what you already know because you never start from scratch never start from a blank page and it can really make a difference just trying to make explicit what's already on on your mind and that gives you a little bit of structure which helps you to start and maybe just start with the projects you have and not having the well not everything has to bubble up from bottom you can just start with your project with the ideas you already have and start with a hierarchy so aluminum set accustomed them he started with topics as he has the main areas of interest of course from there it developed in different ways and the topics became less and less important but it can be a starting point just don't hardwire the hierarchy into your system so maybe that's what general note about how to start yeah I wanna I want to agree in a high light with two things you said the first is not doing massive all-encompassing migrations right in my own in my own teaching and coaching I used to ice to do that I used to either sit with people in person or over calls or over weeks and guide them through these migrations and it would inevitably take of course just incredible amounts of time but then also get really caught up in little details of formatting and things that didn't that weren't able to be translated over and the architecture and all these things I I now teach something that I called the digital Jubilee which is this idea that that once a year is what I recommend if you have a bunch of disorganized notes piled up that you just file them away in an archive put a date on it so you can find them if you really need them but essentially start over you know not take the bag mid the organizational or diss organizational baggage from the past into the future to just to just kind of leave it behind but then also what you said about not always needing to start from the bottom up I used to when I was would write a blog post my first step would be to just go through hundreds and hundreds of notes and and collect material but the problem is what if my criteria was only what is interesting well everything in my note-taking system is interesting that's why I saved it so I would start off the first step of my writing my blog post with just like dozens of pages of notes and then have to spend so much time calling calling calling calling to get down and now I I do more kind of what you suggested which is I start with what do I know is the main idea which is always something more intuitive it's something that comes instantly to mind and then I can go through my notes with that much tighter filter of what do I need what is just essential for me to support that point so I found something similar and looking for problems but that helps too because of course a lot of things are interesting but when you start thinking about what could be your own contribution or what is the problem in this area it gives you some kind of focus it doesn't need to be necessarily formulated question but try to put a finger on what bothers you but what is maybe the problem here and looking for answers to that that can be extremely an extremely good filter absolutely absolutely could you talk a little bit about the the principle that by far people have even had the most questions on or confusion about was the the one to file by context not by subject one person said how do you know what the first of all what is a context how do I know what my contexts are and second how do you know what your contexts are if as you say elsewhere I don't know what you're going to be working on in the future how can you decide when you'll want to see this thing again sure so context and topics are not necessarily mutually exclusive of course a note but in specific context can also be a contribution to a specific topic what I wanted to stress here is the difference to a collection if you think about under what kind of topic do I file this and this is thinking like a collector when you ask yourself to which kind of discussion within which note secrets can this idea contribute a much more dive into the actual content you think about what difference this new information makes for your previous held beliefs for example and information can only make a difference in regards to something I think something to a collection makes of course also different but also the difference in terms of in additional information so context is much more on the content level topic is almost always more about thinking about it and when he looked for context you want to think within something so you're thinking more about the difference the new information makes for what you've written before so you you look at the content level you're not looking at keywords you're not looking at the index you're thinking well is it just an addition or is it a contradiction is messing with my previous I'll believe for this is do I have to change what I thought before and trying to make that explicit so it's about really getting as quickly as possible into the content and not trying to think from a level above where you just sort stuff this is the probably the main pitfall when it comes to collecting notes and it means sorry that you might want to write the notes already in dialogue with pre-existing notes so really treating your system as a dialogue partner and answering to the note you're connecting the new one with which is very different to just collecting absolutely absolutely so it seems like the context is is along the same thread as the topic but a few steps a couple steps further down right you think of the sex of the second order of fact do you think of the consequence you think of the usage of it why do you why do you think that's so hard why didn't people find that a challenge or why is it not natural for them to do that extra bit of thinking on that well I think it's natural to treat any kind of software where you collect ideas as a kind of collection in the beginning and [Music] I'm not sure if it's really hard necessarily I think it's just thinking differently because we like to collect stuff and we like to feel and it seems maybe less productive to thoughts and things how I might have been wrong before information and so I mean that is what interests me really I'm not so interested in having a great output and just reshuffling information into new blog posts or something like that what I'm interested is in how do I discover why I'm wrong where can I transform if you want to previous health believes and that means spending quite a lot of time rethinking stuff you've already written down so maybe that's a part which is probably a little bit less natural yeah yeah it's it's it's very interesting I'm finding something similar where something I've noticed working with people is people tend to read what they know already productivity people tend to productivity books you know engineering people read engineering books literature people read literature books I had this experience going on my wife's on my wife's Facebook feed and it was all reinforcing messages I think you can really only see it when you go on someone else's filter bubble because your own feels completely normal and natural and and I just realized and then I looked on her Kindle I was I was just browsing through her device kind of snooping and I looked at her Kindle it was all books on the three or four or five subjects that she most likes and then I went back to my Kindle and it was exactly the same it's all books on exactly the topics that I already know and I feel like I've moved more towards if I'm reading a book and it says something I know or agree with what's the point of highlighting it you know if I can are if it's already part of my mental model I can already extrapolate it then I just don't even keep it at all only if it if it shocks me surprises me violates my expectations in some way even if I don't understand why then it's more and more I find myself moving that direction because I it's like I want to break them in smile that's learning I want to find the best attack vectors into my existing mental model yeah and I think that's probably the challenge of the time at the moment because it's not that easy in that you can say well just be open-minded if you're open-minded you're opening yourself up to a lot of you don't want that you have to close yourself down but at the same time you don't want to just repeat what you already know so it's not either being open or being closed-minded it's about how do you deal with being selective in the way that still challenges you and that's tricky even to write about that and not yeah it's a challenge but it's an interesting one yeah the question I always like to ask myself when I I find myself in one of these positions is is do I want to be right or do I want to be effective because often I find myself such a such a desire to be right all the time especially in interpersonal situations and then I ask myself okay do you want to be right in the situation or do you want to be effective but now usually makes me go I want to be effective dang it I wanted to ask you about spaced repetition had a couple questions about that so I I have kind of a beef with spaced repetition I kind of feel like spaced repetition is the is the opposite of this the external brain idea it's like the external brain you're trying to offload from the human brain to the external brain with spaced repetition and different memorization techniques are trying to get it from external world onto your brain what's here what do you use spaced repetition and or any memorization techniques and what's what's your take on that I I don't use any memorization technique because I I don't need to memorize anything I I don't know in which situation I need to memorize I mean I I know some professions have the neat if you're nectar you need to rehearse your lines then you need to memorize them but almost always the need for memorization is incomplete artificial settings within education and in almost all cases you can ask yourself if you have trouble with memorization maybe try to understand it a little bit better examples have more connections to other ideas to elaborate a little bit further on it because if you have fully elaborated on something you usually don't need to memorize it so I'm not really interested in memorization having said that I like to I like the feeling of having things on my mind instead of feeling forgetful and I do think that when you have a system in place where you force yourself to revisit on a regular basis old notes that's a kind of built-in repetition or spaced repetition but I wouldn't say that's an explicit memorization technique but I do think that's this principle that's at work here and as far as I know it's and critically quite a solid technique absolutely you mentioned before that there were there were some theoretical questions that you're still pondering one of them was how the technology influences the way you think are there any are there any current or other open questions that you can share with us or I'm curious what the what is the frontier of your own learning in regards to this stuff well one question that it's on top of my mind is what I mentioned earlier how to be open-minded without getting too distracted and how to find well not a balance because balance is usually but yeah how do you work against your biases and well dealing with partisanship and the filter bubbles we encounter and if there are any if education can help with solving that problem yeah that that's one of the things that are more or less on top of my mind in the earlier days it was more how to get inside so how what kind of environment do we need to make inside more likely and to change our mind in a very fundamental way not just a superficial way but in a very fundamental way so I studied a lot of history of science and so the externalization of ideas and thinking outside the box but within an external brain or within a laboratory and the difference between thinking with something and thinking within something that is something I would like to elaborate excellent excellent me too me too so I've covered most of the questions that were sent in previously there's some I think that are not completely appropriate for this call but let's go to the chat I haven't been able to keep up with the many many messages but go ahead and put in the chats anything that you'd like some kid to to touch on well I've seen quite a lot of questions about software and apps and technologies and I mentioned earlier I don't want to dive into that because I think other people have much better overview over what is available I mean tinkering was Rome at the moment so that might be something I turn into a step-by-step description but I haven't made up my mind yet because I not at the level of understanding I still have on my website this old program that Donal Italy which works for me that has its downsides but that is true for almost all technologies at the moment available but I think I need to address that because it's a question on top of many minds at the moment especially when you start you want to make a decision on this software you use but yeah just because I use it doesn't mean it's the best I think it's a one that is explicitly designed to for this system and but yeah in some ways cumbersome and old-fashioned and so looking forward what's coming next do you have any giving advice for for Rome or or the other one you use or any other software makers have there been any systematic blind spots or things that they've missed that you would recommend be included well I think I wait till I answer that question and the moment I'm fully convinced and they're there is a lot to like about Rome but I haven't made my mind this soon at the moment I I've made up my mind I will change the recommendation on my website I will send out a mail so if you if you sign up for my newsletter which is maybe once a year I have really no interest in sending out too much stuff I don't think that's helpful but that would be something that I will announce because I think that I can't make a conclusive statement at the moment okay we have a.m. the next cohort of my course is starting on April 6 and we're gonna have I haven't announced this previously but we're gonna have not Eliason who is a die-hard Rome advocate and the creator of an online course on Rome he's gonna be coming and doing a guest workshop on how to use Rome and specifically how to bridge my ideas and some of the things I teach on that software so if that's something you'd be interested in attending at all I'll be happy to send you that is thanks net Network I not to liason yes yeah well I was in contact with him so if I'm convinced maybe we do something together cool oh good perfect yeah so it's a tightly interconnected networked world of notetaking ironically or appropriately enough I mean that's really the next step that is how to collaborate and not just having standalone notes but think more of thinking about more of inter connecting and collaboration and I think that that will be the next step okay perfect looking through the chat here go ahead and drop any other questions you have someone had a question I don't remember this being mentioned in the book but could you comment on the idea that you should take sufficient notes on a source that you never have to read it again this person said it was Captain Nemo said that that lumen said this but he's worried that it slows down his note-taking too much I mean lumen explicitly said he never revisited book he read once but that's not necessarily because he expected all the information available within that book but because he was very selective and then moved on and I think that's maybe worth addressing because it's another pitfall of trying to in let the system impose a structure on yourself and the system should surf your work help you and shouldn't put pressure on you to make extensive notes so I think being a professional reader doesn't mean to have a certain quality level of note-taking it means to be able to adjust the amount of time and attention to the text you're dealing with and that sometimes means reading the title and chucking it away and sometimes it means taking week to go through and rephrasing it and being able to adjust the attention and the speed that that is really what what it is all about so I'm taking sometimes no notes at all sometimes I skip the part of rephrasing it because I don't need it I know exactly where fits into a manuscript sometimes I write it on a small paper I usually have you know five and I have a wooden box where I collected because I like to take literature notes and it was pen and paper but sometimes many of many notes for just one text because it's about adjusting it's not about making it perfect and if you feel like you're wasting time well then maybe you shouldn't put any more work into that step but think about where you can where to move on yeah I I couldn't I couldn't I want to emphasize that point so strongly but the adaptation I think this is the big pitfall with prescriptions with systems if you outsource all agency to the system but when it's really about it's about adaptation it's about evolution it's funny one of the kinds of emails I get is from say someone takes my course or they read all my articles and then they they write me this very apologetic email like I'm so sorry I hate to do this but I can't use your system exactly as described and then they they write you know all these details about why and how they've they've really thought about it and I write back and say you you've got it you mastered it when you know enough and you're confident enough in the way that you think that you can contradict me and you have good reasons for doing so you don't need to apologize that is actually the peak of learning where you're you no longer need to look to someone like me for answers I think that's a that's a very deep that's a very deep idea okay one more thing sure shoot oh no I was I think we're gonna go ahead and wrap up I was gonna ask you um I want to be sure to end on time I wanted to ask you where people can find you or what where you would send them how they can subscribe to your email list if there's anything else that they can do to find out more about your you and your work well I mentioned the newsletter you'll find it on the website take smart notes calm I need to relaunch that one day but that's maybe one of the things I'm focusing really on on the content statics comes later and but I will do a relaunch certainly the moment I have more time for coaching and counseling and will make much more explicit but I can offer and I can well keep you updated via the mailing lists that's the best thing and the best way to stay in contact okay perfect okay I want to thank you I want to thank you for for taking the time to first write the book and to put all those ideas into concrete form it's really been a huge huge inspiration and also the time to just come here and answer our questions I know you're a busy person and I appreciate just the to spend time with us also want to thank everyone on the call for coming I know that there's a lot going on in the world right now and notes is one of the things that that you might be learning about but I really appreciate you all coming live and allowing this to be a more collaborative exercise well thanks for having me and thank you and we want for you interest thanks everyone I'll have a recording out to all of you soon probably put this on youtube of zonkey agrees and otherwise have a great end of your week but bye everyone [Music]",

world with valuable knowledge in your head notebook or note-taking application take what you've learned or are currently learning and turn it into something useful by adopting the zettelkaston note-taking system the zettacast and note-taking system was invented by german sociologist nicholas lumen lumen used this system to write 58 books and over 500 academic papers by averaging just six notes a day at first the settle casting system will seem primitive because it's just a series of index cards and index card boxes but the advanced way in which the system connects index cards and simplifies the way in which you write the first draft of your book academic paper business plan or article makes this system remarkable i've used this system for a few weeks now and i've been surprised by its power while studying and using it i've discovered two primary reasons why the zettlecaston system is different and better than most note-taking systems first the settle casting system uses a two-stage filter to prevent mediocre ideas from diluting existing notes number two the zettacasting system uses a bottom-up approach to deepen understanding and generate new insights advantage number one the two-stage filter capture interesting information from books lectures articles or podcasts and interesting ideas that come to your mind throughout the day then later in the day review the notes you've captured and convert a select few into permanent notes let's go over both stages in more detail stage one capture literature notes and fleeting notes when making this book summary i gathered what the author calls literature notes by highlighting passages in my ebook reader and extracting them into a note in evernote i also captured sections of online articles that discussed the zettacasting system and put them into separate notes in evernote over the past three days i randomly had ideas about the zettelkasten system like what analogies i would use to explain the system and captured those ideas in a series of fleeting notes in evernote now i use evernote but you can capture literature notes and fleeting notes in any note-taking application you choose whether it be apple notes google keep notion or in a physical notepad capturing fleeting and literature notes is like collecting interesting artifacts on a hike and putting them in your backpack to look at later stage two create permanent notes once a day preferably at the same time every day go through your metaphorical backpack of literature notes and fleeting notes from the past 24 hours and determine which notes you should convert to permanent notes here are two criteria for converting a note into a permanent note criteria number one does this note produce a similar level of excitement as when i first captured it many ideas will seem revolutionary in one context but mundane in another i often have brilliant ideas in a caffeinated state at a coffee shop i love but later find out when i'm at home and the caffeine is worn off that the ideas were nothing special criteria number two does this note add value to other permanent notes you might capture a great idea but if that idea does not seem critical to your project or does not improve your understanding of the topic you're researching you should not waste time converting it into a permanent note now if an idea in your literature notes or an idea from your fleeting notes meets those two criteria make it a permanent note by rewriting it on an index card i like to use 4x6 index cards when you rewrite a note aim to improve it by connecting it to what you know by finding ways to connect new ideas to existing ideas you expand your web of knowledge deepen your understanding and boost your creativity as steve jobs said creativity is just connecting things handwriting notes on index cards forces you to slow down and clarify your ideas and since index cards are space constrained you must express ideas in as few words as possible which will save you a bunch of time when you go to write and edit your first draft now the second advantage of the zettlecatson system is its bottom-up approach most people take a top-down approach to writing by outlining their book article or school paper and then gathering information but having a structured outline too early discourages you from exploring ideas outside of your structure and will promote confirmation bias the zillicasten system uses a bottom-up approach by getting you to follow your curiosity generate a list of keywords as you go and organically grow an outline over time this bottom-up approach to researching and writing is like improvisational sketch comedy the process is more engaging and creative and the result is surprisingly good adopt a bottom-up approach by adding three things to every permanent note a location code prefix to the title a list of keywords in the top right corner and links to permanent notes in the bottom right corner when you prefix every permanent note title with a location code you make it easy to reference your notes later on the first note you add to your zelda casting system will have a one prefix to its title and your second note will have a two prefix to its title but if your third note builds off the first note it should go between notes 1 and 2 and have the code 1a prefixed to its title now if you have notes 1a and 1b and wish to insert a note between those two notes it will have the code 1a1 and if you insert a note between 1a1 and 1a2 its code will be 1a1a notice a pattern now let's talk about keywords keywords are like twitter hashtags in that they group notes together and are used to quickly find relevant notes aim to add one to three keywords to the top right corner of every permanent note identify keywords by asking yourself what one word or phrase relates this note to existing notes when i made this summary a few keywords were permanent notes and bottom-up approach when you come up with a new keyword or phrase put it on your master index located on an index card at the very front of your index card box the master index includes keywords and phrases with location codes like 3a1 that act as entry points for specific topics in your zettlecaston system that will be useful when you're looking to insert new notes into your system and lastly note links a new permanent note may have many potential friends in your zettlecasted system for example if a note could fit nicely behind note 12 a1 but it also relates to notes 2b1 and 24b don't spend too much time debating where the note should go simply put it behind 12 a1 by giving it the code 12a2 and write down the location codes for related notes in the bottom right corner of the note these links will be helpful when you go and write your first draft finding links to notes in other parts of your zittlecast and system will expand your web of knowledge and spark new ideas that will further improve your book school paper or article to summarize start by capturing fleeting notes and literature notes in a mobile note-taking application then once a day convert a select few fleeting notes and literature notes into permanent notes by rewriting them on index cards in your own words then connect new notes to existing notes by adding a location code keywords and links to other permanent notes continuously update your master index with keywords and use your master index to outline your first draft then when your research phase is over go through your zettle casting system sequentially one card at a time and effortlessly write your first draft that was the core message that i gathered from how to take smart notes this is a great book to understand the zittlecast and system and advanced writing and learning techniques i highly recommend it if you would like a one-page pdf summary of insights that i get from this book just click the link below and i'll be happy to email it to you if you already subscribed to the free

number one the two-stage filter capture interesting information from books lectures articles or podcasts and interesting ideas that come to your mind throughout the day then later in the day review the notes you've captured and convert a select few into permanent notes let's go over both stages in more detail stage one capture literature notes and fleeting notes when making this book summary i gathered what the author calls literature notes by highlighting passages in my ebook reader and extracting them into a note in evernote i also captured sections of online articles that discussed the zettacasting system and put them into separate notes in evernote over the past three days i randomly had ideas about the zettelkasten system like what analogies i would use to explain the system and captured those ideas in a series of fleeting notes in evernote now i use evernote but you can capture literature notes and fleeting notes in any note-taking application you choose whether it be apple notes google keep notion or in a physical notepad capturing fleeting and literature notes is like collecting interesting artifacts on a hike and putting them in your backpack to look at later stage two create permanent notes once a day preferably at the same time every day go through your metaphorical backpack of literature notes and fleeting notes from the past 24 hours and determine which notes you should convert to permanent notes here are two criteria for converting a note into a permanent note criteria number one does this note produce a similar level of excitement as when i first captured it many ideas will seem revolutionary in one context but mundane in another i often have brilliant ideas in a caffeinated state at a coffee shop i love but later find out when i'm at home and the caffeine is worn off that the ideas were nothing special criteria number two does this note add value to other permanent notes you might capture a great idea but if that idea does not seem critical to your project or does not improve your understanding of the topic you're researching you should not waste time converting it into a permanent note now if an idea in your literature notes or an idea from your fleeting notes meets those two criteria make it a permanent note by rewriting it on an index card i like to use 4x6 index cards when you rewrite a note aim to improve it by connecting it to what you know by finding ways to connect new ideas to existing ideas you expand your web of knowledge deepen your understanding and boost your creativity as steve jobs said creativity is just connecting things handwriting notes on index cards forces you to slow down and clarify your ideas and since index cards are space constrained you must express ideas in as few words as possible which will save you a bunch of time when you go to write and edit your first draft now the second advantage of the zettlecatson system is its bottom-up approach most people take a top-down approach to writing by outlining their book article or school paper and then gathering information but having a structured outline too early discourages you from exploring ideas outside of your structure and will promote confirmation bias the zillicasten system uses a bottom-up approach by getting you to follow your curiosity generate a list of keywords as you go and organically grow an outline over time this bottom-up approach to researching and writing is like improvisational sketch comedy the process is more engaging and creative and the result is surprisingly good adopt a bottom-up approach by adding three things to every permanent note a location code prefix to the title a list of keywords in the top right corner and links to permanent notes in the bottom right corner when you prefix every permanent note title with a location code you make it easy to reference your notes later on the first note you add to your zelda casting system will have a one prefix to its title and your second note will have a two prefix to its title but if your third note builds off the first note it should go between notes 1 and 2 and have the code 1a prefixed to its title now if you have notes 1a and 1b and wish to insert a note between those two notes it will have the code 1a1 and if you insert a note between 1a1 and 1a2 its code will be 1a1a notice a pattern now let's talk about keywords keywords are like twitter hashtags in that they group notes together and are used to quickly find relevant notes aim to add one to three keywords to the top right corner of every permanent note identify keywords by asking yourself what one word or phrase relates this note to existing notes when i made this summary a few keywords were permanent notes and bottom-up approach when you come up with a new keyword or phrase put it on your master index located on an index card at the very front of your index card box the master index includes keywords and phrases with location codes like 3a1 that act as entry points for specific topics in your zettlecaston system that will be useful when you're looking to insert new notes into your system and lastly note links a new permanent note may have many potential friends in your zettlecasted system for example if a note could fit nicely behind note 12 a1 but it also relates to notes 2b1 and 24b don't spend too much time debating where the note should go simply put it behind 12 a1 by giving it the code 12a2 and write down the location codes for related notes in the bottom right corner of the note these links will be helpful when you go and write your first draft finding links to notes in other parts of your zittlecast and system will expand your web of knowledge and spark new ideas that will further improve your book school paper or article to summarize start by capturing fleeting notes and literature notes in a mobile note-taking application then once a day convert a select few fleeting notes and literature notes into permanent notes by rewriting them on index cards in your own words then connect new notes to existing notes by adding a location code keywords and links to other permanent notes continuously update your master index with keywords and use your master index to outline your first draft then when your research phase is over go through your zettle casting system sequentially one card at a time and effortlessly write your first draft that was the core message that i gathered from how to take smart notes this is a great book to understand the zittlecast and system and advanced writing and learning techniques i highly recommend it if you would like a one-page pdf summary of insights that i get from this book just click the link below and i'll be happy to email it to you if you already subscribed to the free

tech podcast I have Csonka Aaron's he's the author of a book take smart notes website is take smart notes calm you would think that taking notes will be boring and I remember my wife didn't this book was on our counter and my wife had ordered it and I picked up and started reading it and it was super interesting so I wanted to get in touch with Sanka and talk to him and that's why he's here so some good thanks for coming thank you for having me yeah tell me why write a book on taking notes where's all this this way this idea stem from well in the beginning it was really a practical question for myself while I was writing my PhD thesis and as many students when they deal with a lot of information many of the same problems where do I store the things how do I remember what I'm reading and the obvious answer is well you you take notes but then you have the next question so whether you store the notes so you can find them again and as I'm working in the field of education and learning and I'm interested in the way technology and thinking interconnects I have the luxury of turning this very practical personal curiosity how do I do that in the best possible way into a kind of research question and I'm really surprised that so many different interesting questions kind of come together in the very practical seemingly banal question of well how do I take notes so that that really brought me to writing the book just to provide others the ideas and the experience I had so others don't have to go through all the trial and errors and go straight ahead yeah and I guess behind the book is this legendary character and I'll have his name on the tip of my chocolate he was like a master note-taker and an writer can you talk about this person sure that's Niklas Luhmann he is actually not that well known in the english-speaking world he is very well known and sociology and in Germany and other parts in the world as well what's interesting about him is not just his theory so you have this grand theory about society it's rooted in systems theory and in the beginning I was more interested in his theoretical work and it's quite challenging it's very complex and it's very interdisciplinary so he writes about not only in sociology but from a sociological standpoint about all aspects of society like art and economics and politics you name it and later I discovered that the reason he was able to write such dense text with such a complexity was only possible because he strategically externalized his thinking on paper and a kind of side effect really more is this enormous productivity so he started actually as someone who's not working in academia he was working in law and after his 95 job he just read a lot like many people do but also took a lot of notes and he collected the notes in a particular way that enabled him to spark new ideas from just combining old ideas and in a very short time he heard a couple of books out get them published got a professorship in sociology which wasn't his original field and then there's this famous question in the beginning in Germany when you started the professor so what's your project and his answer is well theory of society duration 30 years cost norm and actually 20 in half in 29 a half years later he published the last chapter of this book and in the meantime in these thirty years he published in total about 60 books on a huge variety of topics hundreds of articles and in a superficial way the first thing you get attracted to is of course this kind of productivity and the question is well how can he get slightly more productive by copying the technique he used because whenever he was asked how on earth are you able to to have this kind of output which is not repetitive but very dense and inside his answer was always well I do that with my several custom so here's no taking system I'm not doing that alone most of it happens just outside on paper and I think most years people haven't really appreciated that this is really the reason for his productivity because we are very prone to this idea that some money accomplishes a lot has to be a genius and it's much more mundane to say well he's probably very smart too but the mundane task of writing down what you think sorting it in a particular way that is actually something that makes all the difference and I think nowadays we have a much better understanding how this kind of externalizing really is not just a help for thinking but more like a necessity to really accomplish something so what are some of the things that you know the book mentions a slip box but there's no picture of it you know what are some of the crucial elements of being able to be more effective at taking notes yeah well the I'm speaking about the slip box but I discovered that it really started that people speak about that subtle Caston and use the German word so maybe I just switched to that and born in German again settle custom so it's not really the translation is a box of Indian can't and that is what it's basically is so the technique up obviously is independent of the material years there are software apps available but he used pen and paper in an index card format and he started to write on normal paper and didn't use the classic index cards out of cardboard or this slightly heavier paper because he realized he will write a lot and whenever he can save some space by using thinner paper that that is probably helpful so in the end it's what you find in libraries these kind of furniture index card shelves and they all written in the on the same format always have a fixed ID on the top left which is important because he did not sort his notes by topic so that is something we tend to do intuitively that we have some categories in mind and our first question is well I've written something down where can I store it and the more important question is not where can I store something but where can I retrieve it where do I want to in which kind of context do I want to stumble upon something and be reminded of something I might have forgotten long ago so he would start with writing his first note and give it the ID in number one and the second one number two and three and four and so on interest the interesting power begins when he now adds ideas to already existing ideas and makes connections so then he is starting to branch out and would put a new note behind number one which he would then call number one a sir by swapping between numbers and letters he could indefinitely branch out and topics then would emerge bottom up so the categories are not hardwired into the system he would then rather give himself an overview over in topic by writing a new note because the way we structure a topic or the way we think about categories are changing over time and the problem with many systems which are more built like an archive or that they hardwire the initial idea about how we want to approach something into the system and make it very difficult to change that later so that is interesting for me for the question how can we write in a way that makes it easier for ourselves to change our mind about something and I think that's where the question what kind of technology do I use what kind of system do they use really comes into play so what what's the subject that you know really well so we can do a comparison of how would someone normally make a few notes on this subject and then how you would do it with this different system they're an easy example that you can talk about um I mean it can the question how to change our minds how to be open-minded that that is something that I'm working on at the moment to put it very plainly but I can describe how I approach writing in general because I think that makes it Michael slightly more visible hat how it's different so whenever I read something I always already have in mind some kind of question and I'm working on and what write a few notes just scribble down what I want to remember from the text and that is not the main part so that is just collecting some stuff I'm encountering the interesting bit is the second step and that is actually something that many people already don't do so many people just underlined sentence highlight sentences maybe write a short excerpt but don't do the second step and that is well what does it mean I encountered this great idea that for example technology is relevant for our thinking but that is kind of abstract until we do something with it and to do something with it means in this context to look through all the old notes where can i connect this thought with and at the beginning of course when you only have a few notes it's more like a collection but very quickly a couple of hundred notes you start seeing connections building connections and then you reminded of something you have written maybe a couple of months before on a similar subject and if we would just think about it in our head our mind plays tricks with us so if our mind sees the resemblance it will make it pierre the same but when we have written it down and compare an actual note we have written a couple of months ago with the new one we are writing now we are forced to compare the differences and that is one of the main features that this kind of externalized memory can't be cheated in the same way we cheat ourselves constantly when we remember something in our mind so then I would write the new notes in explicit comparison to the old one maybe extend on an idea maybe notice a contradiction and would wipe that down so it's like an ongoing dialogue with your old self which is constantly developing and that means you spend a lot of time looking at all stuff retrieving it again and thinking about how to make a connection between these two things and interestingly these are exactly the thing theory teaches us we should do when we want to remember something retrieving old memories elaborating on them and actually putting them into our own words so that means it feels much slower when you go through the things you read and put them into your own words and connect them with your own thoughts but in the end it's so much more efficient because you embedded them in the continuous stream of your own thinking and embed the much deeper in your memory so in a slightly counterintuitive why I think it's the much more efficient way to approach new information so you give me an example of a either you or someone you know a project they've worked on where were they at before they learn the system and how is it different for them after this um well most people I talked to so sometimes I I coach people to set up their own set of Calphalon file system and interestingly most of them are not from academia which is what the book was aimed at in the beginning I think that is because people from medicine business and other fields are really interested in storing what they're reading because it's not about collecting it's about how do I bring the new information I gather to my own attention when I need that so those are very outcome orientated I think have an attraction to that and they often struggle with finding a coherent system to write notes down so many tinkerer a lot with different formats so they use a journal and write down all the thoughts they had within a day which is great but it's not perfect because it's sorted in a chronological order and you have a very you have difficulties to find what you have written and others use software apps like Evernote or Google key or and as some markdown app and they have their own restrictions to and interestingly most of them are for forcing you to hardwire some categories so the change is usually not so much about setting the settle casting in exactly the way a lumen did it up but about thinking differently about note-taking itself and thinking about what works for them so they think more about making connections and writing it down in a way that the first thought is always well where do I want to stumble upon that when I have already forgotten what I've written down and the difference it makes is for most of them first of all getting into a routine of writing more and reframing phrasing ideas in their own words which in itself is the best technique for understanding and the experience is often well only in the moment I'm really trying to put it into my own word so I realize I haven't really fully understood what I was reading here so that is usually their first and most obvious effect and the second one is that a coherent system where you only have one kind of permanent Milt's doesn't really matter what kind of scribble notes you take whatever works best but if you make a decision on well everything that it's long term everything that I want to keep forever where I have projects which are not finished and done in a month but continue for longer if you then decide on a particular format you enable yourself to build up a routine and I think that's the most lasting effect that you stop thinking so much about where do I write this down how do I write this down because all these things are decided once and fall I always write it down on this piece of paper or in this application never longer and then a paragraph and I always keep it in the same space and I always go through the same steps of looking for connections writing it down and storing it because if you don't have this kind of standardized way of writing things down it's almost impossible to turn that into a daily routine and most people I spoke to really looking for something where they don't have to think anymore about where to put stuff but which can be integrated into their everyday routine usually in the evening yeah well beyond where you know what are some of the mechanics of this beyond you know let's say I'm taking notes on various literature I end up with 500 index cards of notes you know what would a typical person do in an attempt to synthesize them into a book or a thesis about what I'm studying versus little chasm system sure so I think the first thing to keep in mind is that you separate a couple of steps and the first one is really this gathering of information either if you encounter something during your day or in a lecture or during a talk or you're reading something that that is very similar to David Allen's GTD approach that the first step is just collecting stuff and the second step is to process it the difference to David Allen is that this approach works very well to projects where you have a definite outcome and you don't want to lose sight where you're heading when you're looking for an insight or working in research you don't know what you're looking for because that's the definition of inside something you cannot foresee otherwise you would already know it so the second step is slightly different and the what I do is before I write and you note I look through my set of cussin write down a couple of numbers white might connect to decide on the one that connects most obviously two and then write it and directly in response to that so over time there something builds up and I see iwere cluster builds and this is usually where I then decide well I can turn that into your lecture or I can turn that into an article and then you swap to the third step and that is what you have to outline the manuscript whatever that is for and that is a different mindset working on a manuscript is a different mindset than working within the slip box and developing ideas because then you have to decide where is this what is this about how do I want to structure that you have to put it in a linear order and the good thing now is you don't start from scratch anymore because you already have built up resource of materials and notes you can immediately use to reshuffle them into something that could work as the outline of an article or a manuscript and it immediately shows you where the gaps are where you have to strengthen an argument where you have to if to work on contradictions and then it's really the classic way of how you deal with an argument in manuscript you have to get a first rough draft out that is definitely not perfect so you can go to the next step and that is looking at it with the eyes of the reader and then Reeve writing it because that's way usually most people spend most of the time on and that is rewriting non perfect draft does this gives me an idea about how to approach it well again mechanistically like how would you do all this you know I I imagine myself sitting there again with a whole bunch of note cards and I think most people get lost at this point and maybe just start looking through the note cards and thinking uh you know what am I going to do with all this stuff so is there a system within Zeno Caston that shows you how to look at you know you it sounds like you've categorized them quote-unquote properly first but still you're sitting there with a whole heap of them how do you now process them and look for connections and no one wants to match to which and how to put them back in the box and all that yeah well it might sound it sounded a little bit more simple than it actually is because the idea is it's quite easy it's it's simple but it's not so easy to get into a routine and to actually do it so one thing I've left out is you have to have an index you have to have an alphabetical index that gives you an overview where things are because the notes are not sorted by category is therefore you have to give yourself it an overview in a different way and the simplest is just keeping an index so luma and had enough vertical index where he would just point to particular notes which are like entry notes into a cluster to that particular topic or a concept or a theory usually when you that set of customer has a kind of feedback loop that gives you feedback when you need something else so in the beginning you won't have any trouble because you only have a few nodes and you know where they are and might track them in the index but after a while you kind of lose the idea where things are so when you see there is a cluster building on a particular topic like running then I would write in your note that gives me an overview so that would be a note with links to all the relevant notes to that particular topic in already a structured way and I can later replace that but for the moment that would be the entry note which I refer to from the index and the second very pragmatic thing is when I work on projects I also have a particular notes which are entries into that so on these notes I link to their relevant topics within that set of calcine I might use so when I then start with a manuscript I would start with the structure which is written on these kind of overview notes so that that is the main way of keeping track where you where you store things but it's it would be a misunderstanding to think that it is about having an overview of everything you have in there because we don't have an overview over everything we know either it's more about getting as quickly as possible into the topics on the content level where we can continue the thought and pick up where we left it the last time so that is really the main idea about these index so what do you want your role to be in that okay um you're gonna be a you know you've written about it so you gonna be a big promoter of it and you're gonna be selling little cats and boxes or you know what do you want your world to be well the main idea really was to have something I can give to my students because I see them struggle with notes and I can relate to that because I struggled a lot and use a lot of different systems and I know what a different this it makes not to have to think about where do I put stuff and where can I find it and it gets you a much quicker - - what's really relevant and that is well the content itself but that was the main purpose I I do offer coaching for people who want to get into it or explained it differently and I also would like to see that better software apps will be available because we have a lot of tinkering going on at the moment so the idea is very well-received and I it's obvious that there is a huge need for this kind of system where it can act ideas in a nonlinear way and but it's obvious even though it's obvious that this is something that can be easily emulated in a software application there is nothing yet that completely convinces me so there's one which I linked to from my website which I use myself I'm happy with it but it's in the end a one-man project and I would like to see an open-source project coming out which will be developed further and I don't think that can be turned into a regular business because it has to be open source when you and trust your thinking and your writing to a system which ideally works for the very long haul ideally for life you can't make yourself dependent on a on a company that might get out of business so I think it needs to be open source and I hope that we can set up something in the near future where people can build upon yeah that that's the next idea have you made those that outcast in footnote boxes or you know your students ever make them have you found that that's useful you know to have more physical components to it instead of an app or do you think an app is more the way to go I think it depends a little bit on what the preferences are I started with paper and I swapped to a digital one but that's mainly because I travel a lot and I want to have it with me I'm surprised and intrigued by the fact that a lot of people prefer and then paper and who are working in software development so I would say it's almost 50/50 who's working with pen and paper always preferring a subscribe but I think those are from my observation which is not empirical research but I have the feeling those who work professionally with software prefer pen and paper much more often than you think that their physical is so important with stuff like this you know and many people have a kind of routine and by writing things down it slows them the thinking down it has a physicality to it software can't emulate and I totally get that and when I do quick notes I always have pen and paper with me I don't think that can be replaced completely but on the other hand having a software it can do a full text search have everything available all the time that is hard to beat - so that there are papers of slightly more clumsy maybe there would be a hybrid where you take notes physically the software component helps you do searches on different thoughts and different themes connect things and then you could always you know incorporate that and partner with the physical on it yeah I think that's that would be the way to go it's a little bit in the future but obviously I think this strong difference will soon be something of the past yeah I mean I'm sure that's true that a combination of both will will be the standard way to go okay well very good what's wrong can you restate the name you book and tell people where it is and then if they want to you know ask you about coaching how can they contact you sure so the book is called how to take smart notes and available on bookstores and more information also to the software and if you want to get in contact with me and it's the website take smart notes calm okay very good never and people can I guess I get in touch everything for you in that place okay excellent okay well Sunka thank you for coming on the podcast I really appreciate it thank you very much having me again yep great you're listening to the future tech podcast with Richard Jacobs future technologies such as artificial intelligence stem cells 3d printing gene editing Bitcoin

counterintuitive why I think it's the much more efficient way to approach new information so you give me an example of a either you or someone you know a project they've worked on where were they at before they learn the system and how is it different for them after this um well most people I talked to so sometimes I I coach people to set up their own set of Calphalon file system and interestingly most of them are not from academia which is what the book was aimed at in the beginning I think that is because people from medicine business and other fields are really interested in storing what they're reading because it's not about collecting it's about how do I bring the new information I gather to my own attention when I need that so those are very outcome orientated I think have an attraction to that and they often struggle with finding a coherent system to write notes down so many tinkerer a lot with different formats so they use a journal and write down all the thoughts they had within a day which is great but it's not perfect because it's sorted in a chronological order and you have a very you have difficulties to find what you have written and others use software apps like Evernote or Google key or and as some markdown app and they have their own restrictions to and interestingly most of them are for forcing you to hardwire some categories so the change is usually not so much about setting the settle casting in exactly the way a lumen did it up but about thinking differently about note-taking itself and thinking about what works for them so they think more about making connections and writing it down in a way that the first thought is always well where do I want to stumble upon that when I have already forgotten what I've written down and the difference it makes is for most of them first of all getting into a routine of writing more and reframing phrasing ideas in their own words which in itself is the best technique for understanding and the experience is often well only in the moment I'm really trying to put it into my own word so I realize I haven't really fully understood what I was reading here so that is usually their first and most obvious effect and the second one is that a coherent system where you only have one kind of permanent Milt's doesn't really matter what kind of scribble notes you take whatever works best but if you make a decision on well everything that it's long term everything that I want to keep forever where I have projects which are not finished and done in a month but continue for longer if you then decide on a particular format you enable yourself to build up a routine and I think that's the most lasting effect that you stop thinking so much about where do I write this down how do I write this down because all these things are decided once and fall I always write it down on this piece of paper or in this application never longer and then a paragraph and I always keep it in the same space and I always go through the same steps of looking for connections writing it down and storing it because if you don't have this kind of standardized way of writing things down it's almost impossible to turn that into a daily routine and most people I spoke to really looking for something where they don't have to think anymore about where to put stuff but which can be integrated into their everyday routine usually in the evening yeah well beyond where you know what are some of the mechanics of this beyond you know let's say I'm taking notes on various literature I end up with 500 index cards of notes you know what would a typical person do in an attempt to synthesize them into a book or a thesis about what I'm studying versus little chasm system sure so I think the first thing to keep in mind is that you separate a couple of steps and the first one is really this gathering of information either if you encounter something during your day or in a lecture or during a talk or you're reading something that that is very similar to David Allen's GTD approach that the first step is just collecting stuff and the second step is to process it the difference to David Allen is that this approach works very well to projects where you have a definite outcome and you don't want to lose sight where you're heading when you're looking for an insight or working in research you don't know what you're looking for because that's the definition of inside something you cannot foresee otherwise you would already know it so the second step is slightly different and the what I do is before I write and you note I look through my set of cussin write down a couple of numbers white might connect to decide on the one that connects most obviously two and then write it and directly in response to that so over time there something builds up and I see iwere cluster builds and this is usually where I then decide well I can turn that into your lecture or I can turn that into an article and then you swap to the third step and that is what you have to outline the manuscript whatever that is for and that is a different mindset working on a manuscript is a different mindset than working within the slip box and developing ideas because then you have to decide where is this what is this about how do I want to structure that you have to put it in a linear order and the good thing now is you don't start from scratch anymore because you already have built up resource of materials and notes you can immediately use to reshuffle them into something that could work as the outline of an article or a manuscript and it immediately shows you where the gaps are where you have to strengthen an argument where you have to if to work on contradictions and then it's really the classic way of how you deal with an argument in manuscript you have to get a first rough draft out that is definitely not perfect so you can go to the next step and that is looking at it with the eyes of the reader and then Reeve writing it because that's way usually most people spend most of the time on and that is rewriting non perfect draft does this gives me an idea about how to approach it well again mechanistically like how would you do all this you know I I imagine myself sitting there again with a whole bunch of note cards and I think most people get lost at this point and maybe just start looking through the note cards and thinking uh you know what am I going to do with all this stuff so is there a system within Zeno Caston that shows you how to look at you know you it sounds like you've categorized them quote-unquote properly first but still you're sitting there with a whole heap of them how do you now process them and look for connections and no one wants to match to which and how to put them back in the box and all that yeah well it might sound it sounded a little bit more simple than it actually is because the idea is it's quite easy it's it's simple but it's not so easy to get into a routine and to actually do it so one thing I've left out is you have to have an index you have to have an alphabetical index that gives you an overview where things are because the notes are not sorted by category is therefore you have to give yourself it an overview in a different way and the simplest is just keeping an index so luma and had enough vertical index where he would just point to particular notes which are like entry notes into a cluster to that particular topic or a concept or a theory usually when you that set of customer has a kind of feedback loop that gives you feedback when you need something else so in the beginning you won't have any trouble because you only have a few nodes and you know where they are and might track them in the index but after a while you kind of lose the idea where things are so when you see there is a cluster building on a particular topic like running then I would write in your note that gives me an overview so that would be a note with links to all the relevant notes to that particular topic in already a structured way and I can later replace that but for the moment that would be the entry note which I refer to from the index and the second very pragmatic thing is when I work on projects I also have a particular notes which are entries into that so on these notes I link to their relevant topics within that set of calcine I might use so when I then start with a manuscript I would start with the structure which is written on these kind of overview notes so that that is the main way of keeping track where you where you store things but it's it would be a misunderstanding to think that it is about having an overview of everything you have in there because we don't have an overview over everything we know either it's more about getting as quickly as possible into the topics on the content level where we can continue the thought and pick up where we left it the last time so that is really the main idea about these index so what do you want your role to be in that okay um you're gonna be a you know you've written about it so you gonna be a big promoter of it and you're gonna be selling little cats and boxes or you know what do you want your world to be well the main idea really was to have something I can give to my students because I see them struggle with notes and I can relate to that because I struggled a lot and use a lot of different systems and I know what a different this it makes not to have to think about where do I put stuff and where can I find it and it gets you a much quicker - - what's really relevant and that is well the content itself but that was the main purpose I I do offer coaching for people who want to get into it or explained it differently and I also would like to see that better software apps will be available because we have a lot of tinkering going on at the moment so the idea is very well-received and I it's obvious that there is a huge need for this kind of system where it can act ideas in a nonlinear way and but it's obvious even though it's obvious that this is something that can be easily emulated in a software application there is nothing yet that completely convinces me so there's one which I linked to from my website which I use myself I'm happy with it but it's in the end a one-man project and I would like to see an open-source project coming out which will be developed further and I don't think that can be turned into a regular business because it has to be open source when you and trust your thinking and your writing to a system which ideally works for the very long haul ideally for life you can't make yourself dependent on a on a company that might get out of business so I think it needs to be open source and I hope that we can set up something in the near future where people can build upon yeah that that's the next idea have you made those that outcast in footnote boxes or you know your students ever make them have you found that that's useful you know to have more physical components to it instead of an app or do you think an app is more the way to go I think it depends a little bit on what the preferences are I started with paper and I swapped to a digital one but that's mainly because I travel a lot and I want to have it with me I'm surprised and intrigued by the fact that a lot of people prefer and then paper and who are working in software development so I would say it's almost 50/50 who's working with pen and paper always preferring a subscribe but I think those are from my observation which is not empirical research but I have the feeling those who work professionally with software prefer pen and paper much more often than you think that their physical is so important with stuff like this you know and many people have a kind of routine and by writing things down it slows them the thinking down it has a physicality to it software can't emulate and I totally get that and when I do quick notes I always have pen and paper with me I don't think that can be replaced completely but on the other hand having a software it can do a full text search have everything available all the time that is hard to beat - so that there are papers of slightly more clumsy maybe there would be a hybrid where you take notes physically the software component helps you do searches on different thoughts and different themes connect things and then you could always you know incorporate that and partner with the physical on it yeah I think that's that would be the way to go it's a little bit in the future but obviously I think this strong difference will soon be something of the past yeah I mean I'm sure that's true that a combination of both will will be the standard way to go okay well very good what's wrong can you restate the name you book and tell people where it is and then if they want to you know ask you about coaching how can they contact you sure so the book is called how to take smart notes and available on bookstores and more information also to the software and if you want to get in contact with me and it's the website take smart notes calm okay very good never and people can I guess I get in touch everything for you in that place okay excellent okay well Sunka thank you for coming on the podcast I really appreciate it thank you very

                "content": "- Let's explore the top three insights from 'How to Take Smart Notes' by Sönke Ahrens. One of the big challenges around personal growth and development is remembering the many insights that we've come across throughout our everyday lives, from books, videos, podcasts, articles all kinds of interesting informational sources and while it can certainly be fun to passively consume interesting information. If we aren't able to recall that information at the moment when it could serve us best then we're really missing out on the bulk of the value from having consumed that information. Now, this book has completely transformed the way that I think about reading and learning in general. It's far more than just a guide on how to take better notes. It's a complete system for better understanding, comparing and revisiting insights over time. So it's really about making sure that you get the most value out of the ideas that you come across throughout everyday life. So let's dive into my three favorite insights from the book to help you decide whether or not it's the right book for you. Beginning with insight number one. The better way to store valuable ideas. A great note taking system should do two things very well. Number one, it should save you from having to remember absolutely everything on your own. You should be able to dump the information that you collect or the insights that you come across in to a trusted external system so that you can free up your brain to focus on other things. And number two, it should really support and facilitate the understanding, connecting and revisiting of interesting insights and information. And ultimately it's the second step that really separates what we're gonna cover here from traditional note-taking systems. And ultimately this is what makes for a better and more long-term personal knowledge management system where you're gathering new and interesting information and actually building on what you already know as opposed to just collecting new insights. Now, unfortunately, the issue with many common note-taking practices is that they prioritize convenience at the point of discovering or identifying an interesting insight rather than making it easy for you to revisit and connect ideas over time. So for example, I've used popular note taking apps like Evernote or Microsoft OneNote and they make it very convenient to be able to save links or articles or quotes or PDF or other interesting bits of information but it's less convenient to revisit and organize and sort through that information in the future. And the same is true when it comes to physical note taking like highlighting a passage in a book or writing a brief note in a margin, or even adding a post-it note to indicate interesting sections of a book. What all of these approaches have in common is that they really, like I said prioritize convenience when it comes to identifying or saving interesting information but they're less effective when it comes to revisiting that information. And really this comes down to two things. On the one hand often these systems are incredibly disorganized. You've dumped a lot of interesting information into the system, but it's difficult to wade through it and sort the relevant from the irrelevant. And then number two, in some cases if you are a very organized person and you meticulously maintain a clear structure for all the insights and information that you come across this is actually too rigid of a system for us to gain the full benefit of the insights that we've discovered because this is not how our brains operate. We don't sort information into carefully siloed or structured areas in our mind. Instead, we make dynamic and interesting connections between information. And that's something that we're gonna come back to here in a minute. But the system presented in the book is the slip-box method as used by Niklas Luhmann who is considered one of the most influential social theorists of all time. He published 58 books over a 30 year period and that's not including translations or other books. In fact, that were published based on his notes after his passing. And his method simply involves turning interesting insights into bite-sized linkable notes. And he did this in three steps. Number one, whenever he identified or discovered a new, interesting insight he would immediately capture that insight in a temporary or fleeting notes. He'd have pen and paper handy and he would quickly make a note to make sure he captured that idea before he forgot about it. Number two, within a 24 to 48 hour period while the idea was still fresh in his mind he would convert that temporary note into a more detailed and yet concise bite-sized permanent note. And then step number three is to take that permanent note, add it into his slip-box system by either adding it behind a closely related idea, referencing it from a closely related idea or finally referencing it from an index or entry point note. Now the power of the system isn't simply in capturing more and more insights over time, but rather it's about developing better ideas by understanding, comparing and revisiting interesting ideas over time. And to really make this system work we need to focus on two things. Number one, writing better notes and number two making interesting connections between those notes. So let's continue on to insight number two. The critical step that changes everything. The way that we construct notes is just as important as the system in which we store them. So building on what we covered in insight number one let's cover two common note-taking mistakes. Number one, we take a very passive approach to gathering information. So as I mentioned earlier, we might take links or articles or PDFs and just dump them into a system like Evernote or the same is true of physical note-taking. But this is a very passive approach where we're not really taking the time to process the insight or the information to make sure that we understand it at a deep level. Instead, we're simply just identifying something that's interesting and throwing it into our system so that we don't forget about it. Now, the second mistake that we make is we fail to capture the full context of the insight at the moment we discover it. Because in many cases an interesting quote or an interesting article might hold specific relevance to something that we're working on at that moment or something that we're experiencing in our lives. But all we do is capture the quote or the article or the idea. And in many cases, we fail to capture the context or what caused that particular insight or idea to create a breakthrough for us. So by ignoring the context, or at least not recording the context, we can really miss out on a lot of the value behind the idea. And I'm sure you've experienced this going back through notes from the past suddenly you find an interesting quote but you don't really remember why that quote was so important to you. This is the kind of thing that I'm talking about. If we fail to capture the context, then we lose a lot of the value that could have been captured had we actually identified that at the moment. Now the critical step when capturing insights is to rewrite them in our own words. So rather than just saving or noting something that is interesting we wanna take the time to digest the information and then convey it in our own words taking into consideration our own context. And in many ways, stripping away the original context and really just focusing on how that particular insight stands out to us and why it was interesting to us and how it can be applied to our overall knowledge system that we're building with the slip-box over time. Now, as you might remember there are three steps in the process. Step number one is to quickly make a temporary note just to identify something interesting. In many ways this is what we typically do when taking notes. But the second step is what we're focused on here which is rewriting that insight or that idea in our own words, to fit our own context. And this really comes with three significant benefits to this approach. Number one, it's a simple way to test our understanding of the insight. Number two, it helps to lock in our learning and boost retention. And number three, the note will of course include our unique context or perspective. Now, just to be clear each note should only convey a single idea or insight. So we're not trying to cover multiple things. We want a concise, bite-sized linkable note. It should be written in full sentences. It should make reference to the original source and it should be easily understandable by anybody else that's not familiar with the original source. And in terms of length the original slip-box system was written on individual index cards. So you kinda wanna aim for somewhere between one and three paragraphs as concise as is possible while still including the key information needed to understand the insight. So with that in mind let's put everything together by continuing on to insight number three. The key to deeper learning and retention. Individual insights have very limited value on their own, especially when we only really consider them within the original context in which they were originally discovered. Now the real power of knowledge and understanding is in making connections between diverse ideas. This is how we build a growing body of knowledge and understanding over time. So we wanna focus more on the connections between ideas than just on the ideas themselves. Now, as I mentioned earlier common note-taking involves organizing ideas based on topic or theme or in some cases based on the original source of that information. So we might have our favorite notes from a book that we've read or we might have our favorite quotes or ideas that relate to a specific topic. But this is not how our brains naturally operate. We don't organize information in our heads based solely on the topic or the theme or the original source. We might keep track of those relationships but we also make more dynamic connections between ideas from alternative sources and across themes and across topics. We have all kinds of interesting connections that we make in our heads. So rather than thinking about everything organized like a library we really wanna build a dynamic web of information. This is how our brains naturally operate and this is what we wanna achieve when building our own personal knowledge management system like the slip-box. Now the original approach used physical index cards and each card covered one idea and had a unique identifier. So for example, cards might be numbered 23, 24, 25 but if you wanted to insert a relevant insight between any of the cards that already existed in the library then you could simply name it 24A or 24B or 24B2. You could dynamically adjust the references so that you could insert a card with relevant cards. And better still you could create dynamic links between cards by simply referencing its original identifier. So if card number 24 had something to do with card number 196A well you could simply reference that unique identifier and show a connection between those two different ideas. Now, fortunately, today we have far better solutions in the form of applications and software. So tools like Obsidian and Rome Research make things much easier to create connections between closely related ideas. And these tools use something called bi-directional linking. So for example, if you have a one insight let's say it's talking about water and you wanna link it with another insight to do with ice well, you can simply make a reference from water to ice and automatically when you're browsing the ice reference you can see that there's a link coming from water. So it's a two way relationship. By linking A to B you can see that B has a link coming to it from A. Now there are three reasons why this method is so powerful. Number one, every connection enhances a system and our own thinking at the same time because when we make these connections we're being more intentional about how we wanna think about ideas. And we're actually sort of being the architect for our own brain. In that we're saying, this idea is connected to this idea. And by making that connection explicitly in a tool like Obsidian, we're now adjusting the way that we think and we're making that connection in our own heads. And of course, we can go back to Obsidian or other tools like this, and actually browse through these connections dynamically to really reinforce those relationships. Number two, much of creativity is based on combining and remixes existing ideas. So by facilitating these connections, we increase the odds that we're gonna have creative breakthroughs where we suddenly realize really interesting connections between what otherwise might be two separate ideas that we might not normally or naturally see the connection between. And number three, interesting connections inspire further exploration and research. So every time we make an interesting connection we unlock new opportunities. We're motivated to then explore new avenues that might've opened up, syncing those connections. And just as our body of knowledge grows over time we're of course inspired to fill in gaps and to extend things even further. So that's really the power of the slip-box system. We build this growing body of knowledge in which we can continue to extend, we can reference back to, we can continue to make interesting connections and it really allows us to take everything to that next level. Now let's talk quickly about how to apply these insights in your everyday life. Remember this all comes down to three steps. Number one, you make a quick temporary or fleeting note at the moment when you discover a new insight or idea that appeals to you. Number two, we take the time within 24 to 48 hours to convert that temporary note into a permanent note that we write in our own words to confirm that we understand the idea. And so that easily referenced back to it fully taking into consideration the original context in which we discovered that idea. And then step number three, we put it into our slip-box system and we make interesting connections between that new discovery and previous insights and ideas that were already stored in the system. Now, after reading this book I've been inspired to create my own slip-box system to store the many insights and ideas that I gather from the books that I read. And I'm going to be using Obsidian. It's a completely free tool. You can get it at obsidian.mdl. I'll include the link down in the episode description box. I've just started on this journey. So I've got a lot to learn, a lot to discover. I've just started to create some of my first cards, my first notes in the system. So I do plan to build this up a little bit but eventually I'm going to share some of the journey some of the process and my own experiences building a slip-box system. So if you're interested in following my progress there and hearing about the things that I learned along the way definitely subscribe to the channel and stay tuned for future updates. But that's it for this book summary. If you have any questions or comments about anything that we covered here let me know in the comment section below, and again be sure to subscribe so you can follow my updates, learn from other interesting books like this and follow my own journey using the slip-box method.",

Michael Becker hey everybody uh welcome to uh this week's Tinderbox May 7th is our Meetup uh and we're really and let me just kind of go through the the 10th um General format the general format is we go around the room and we have new people introduce themselves we've got a ton of those today um we'll then uh we tend to then talk about like what are we doing in this whole area of personal and learning Knowledge Management what tool skills are we using uh to accomplish that we'll then talk about how we're using Tinderbox to help us achieve those goals or any other tools within the community uh within the Frameworks to help us achieve those goals and then we dig into either uh specific problem solving that somebody may have um or will address a theme that we have for that particular event and today we've got a theme and if you don't mind let's skip some of the introductions of new people today because we don't want to waste any time at all uh and we have the uh and I'm gonna asanki arms how do I print I'm terrible at names is that okay I'm terrible with names as well okay and he is the author of how to take smart notes and and I have to tell you I'm I'm like so excited about this because I came across your book when it first came out and it was like raw eye dropping revolutionary for me and there were still some nuggets in there that I carry with me like every morning I wake up I'm like all right this is how to do it and it's been I'm just so grateful for you for having written it and helped me along my path and then I'm just terribly excited I'm kind of a groupie to have you actually be here and be able to share your thoughts and ideas with us so um so thank you uh and so with that in mind zonkey has agreed to join us and and just guide us in a discussion uh along his book uh on um how to take smart notes so um please use the chat please ask him questions let's have a really fertile dialogue and then in the end if we have time we can talk about Tinderbox stuff and all that but I suspect we won't so let's Jump Right In on it's okay you want to introduce yourself and uh help us guide us through the conversation sure um thank you for having me um yeah I'm the author of how to take smart notes um I it was a bit of a procrastination project I was writing on something else but then I felt um I needed to write a little bit about how I write because um the way uh writing is being taught in university is often so diameterally um different to how I worked that I felt I needed to have something for my students that is not misleading and the uh the main problem seemed to me that writing was often taught as an afterthought of thinking and in a very linear way so still people often ask for about my workflow assuming that you started at a certain point you get an idea you get an assignment you agreed to hand in an article then you start from that idea you do your research you do your reading then you write about what you read then you stop thinking about it and in the end you write it down and this also mirrors in a way a shift in philosophy about how we think about the relationship between writing and thinking um that's I was very interested in at the moment on a theoretical basis um so it was a nice opportunity to um still without actually mentioning the philosophy behind it the practicality of um certain um uh discussions which are more on an abstract level and also I was always interested in Nicholas Lumen and his work on uh social systems and System Theory in general so my background is a little bit um uh philosophy of education on the one hand with emphasis on social systems and sociology but in the other hand I'm a trained therapist and coach in systems therapy so um Nicholas Roman was also influential on that side and at the same time the subtle cousin was often more discussed as a curiosity and not really in relationship to the theory in itself and I wasn't always interested in in the relationship between the actual physical work of thinkers and the outcome so there's obviously no linear relationship no cause of a relationship but I don't think Lumen would have been able to um write such a complex Theory to develop such a complex Theory without the sophisticated external um brain where he can um delegate the complexity delegate the memory uh and focus on what the brain is actually very good in and that is making an association uh comparing things and it's so much easier to compare things when you have it in front of you so um yeah there was kind of the reason I was interested in um in writing that book and I think it's resonates with uh um a new development and or a new interest in the external brain or externalizing um ideas uh taking the material side of um um knowledge work more into consideration um but yeah so um I'm now more interested in where you want to pick up on um what questions you have because I assume that yes this is a regular Meetup you have certain lines of discussions and interests that are recurring and gear uh discussed with different people from different perspectives so I'm I'm happy to join in so Dominique I see you're online and in the Forum this week you talked about you know this idea of when you're taking notes how do you distinguish between you know that really rough note and the and the larger note and making them discoverable along the way and that whole process of curating knowledge and but before we bring him up I wanted to kind of comment when I was doing my um my my test for my doctoral uh uh process um I remember reading a book just prior to taking my test and they said writing was thinking and you know in the first what 38 years of my life no one ever bothered to tell me that and I think that the fact that you brought that up maybe you can talk a little bit about that more as well like how this process of writing is actually thinking um as opposed to documenting of simple documentation or what's the distinction for you yeah I mean there's this um wonderful book by any Murphy Paul uh I hope I get her name right um about the extended mind um and that is very much an overview over different research areas and the rediscovery of the importance of the outside of the brain so it makes a difference if you think alone or if you think with peers if you think with a pen in your hand or just staring at the wall or the blank page um I spend a lot of time reading about um history of Natural Sciences and work in the laboratory and there you find um a lot of um informal um ways in which scientists describe their work and they always seem to emphasize how they think with uh their tools and how um the um laboratory is in a way um the um The Horizon which in thinking happens and it would be um strange to reduce um the thinking uh into the brain and so there you find this um informal speech with just always treating the environment as part of the thinking process and at the same time a struggle on a um for philosophers of science to to grasp that concept because it's still very much representational uh with the idea it's about getting the outside insight and um yeah getting away from that clear Cartesian distinction between inside and outside I think discussions like you have can be very much put into this um new rediscovery of um the importance of um the extended mind okay and anybody have any reactions comments to that or thoughts I can chime in with more but um what do you think thoughts ideas like so what like you know it's also called the second brain right so what are your what is what would you recommend as the tools and the techniques for marrying this extended mind with um you know with our own internal self uh would you call it the internal and external and and how does that apply to your note-taking process right um well first of all the metaphors uh something worth discussing um the extended mind is certainly something different than a second brain um and maybe it's semantics but I often think behind the semantics is a certain idea about the relationship between the tools we use and um our own thinking um I don't think there is a um something you can recommend generally to everyone because obviously the tools of someone who's working in the laboratory are very different to the tools you use when you're a social scientist I'm obviously more drawn to lumens approach but when it comes to the question what digital tools do you use to replicate the subtle custom um and to transfer the analog into the digital um that is a more difficult problem than people often seem to realize because um you can't just imitate um the analog in the digital if you try to be as close as possible to the original uh pen and paper version I don't think you come up with the best solution I think coming up with the best solution means using uh the strength of the digital in in the best way possible and having more a loose idea about the analog as an um background idea um and I try not to fall into the Trap of the shiny new toy and um change um constantly between applications but my process was roughly I started with pen and paper I changed the format then in the early days I just had an HTML website where I linked manually in an editor then I had a mix of analog and digital because some things make more sense in digital having lists and indica Etc um and then I used wrong for a while and because I Was preparing an online course um and the requests were overwhelmingly for obsidian um I um looked closely closer at obsidian and um how much trouble it would be to transfer my notes into that make myself familiar enough to to be able to say something intelligent about it and now I kind of um sticking with that and um yeah that's right are you a Mac or a PC user I'm a PC user got it then that's probably why yeah so at some point when you and we won't do it now but if you're interested let's have a side conversation and I'll happily show you the uh The Tinderbox tool and I I think we'll I'll make it my my missionary my missionary objective to convert you into this back world it's pretty it's pretty darn cool but uh well that that's for a later dialogue Mr Lou you got your hands up been up a while yes thank you uh Dr Aarons I really appreciate your work I appreciate your being here with us today I have a very specific question about a kind of note-taking I'm also a social scientist I'm a sociologist I work in German social theory as a matter of fact so very close I've read lumon's work I've used lumon's work I primarily work on Harper Moss but I move back and forth my question is a very specific one when you're reading that kind of dense social theory that requires close reading line by line really even sometimes certainly paragraph by paragraph and you're trying to reconstruct a larger argument I understand the general principle of writing to internalize for yourself writing what this means to you but you're trying to capture a larger argument in the context of the the Zeto costume type program that you're that you're described that you write about how do you how do you do that one very specific kind of problem of reconstructing a dense argument from a series of you know attacks that basically where you can't simply say well I think he's saying this about the public sphere it's a very very specific kind of layered reconstruction what what do you how do you handle that and I by the way I use your book I I've given it to graduate students I've used it to teach graduate students and it's extremely useful thank you um can you hover mosque you made a reference to a name I've never heard couldn't couldn't even begin to spell it h-a-b-e-r-m-a-s Jurgen habermas he's a one of the leading German social theorists World social theorists one could say yeah okay um yeah um yeah that's it it could later share an anecdote to build Harbor miles but um to your point I think this this is really important to um well I I think I would now um generalize a little bit less than I've done in the book which was written with um uh students and young academics in mind which often [Music] um um spent have to spend a lot of time reconstructing complex arguments in their own words and not skipping that process by just copying pasting quotes Etc um this in my own teaching often what I feel most important and that's probably why I emphasized that but equally important is um not treating or text the same and there's a reason I assume you you mentioned a specific kind of dense text because you have to treat it differently to a popular science book with one idea which is then repeated in different examples and the art of note-taking or taking literature notes is really in realizing how much effort you have to put in uh relation to the text you're dealing with and it's maybe less about is it a dance text or a less dense tax but how familiar am I as a reader with the topic um I sometimes spend a lot of time with a book because I'm unfamiliar with the topic almost everything seems new and interesting to me so I write a lot of things down and then in the end I have to go back to the beginning because I have to rewrite something because I needed to understand something in the end of the book before I realized the importance of something that was mentioned in the beginning so these literature notes tend to be more like excerpts and a little bit more um um yeah longer and extensive but when I'm familiar with the topic I usually know what I want from a text um I'm interested in a particular argument I ignore everything that is um explained to readers who are new and maybe I don't even take a literature note but just extract what I need from it and put it directly into the subtle calcium as a comment um or a footnote or something like that Luman himself um had very brief literature notes so you often really have only a few words um on page seven it says something about organizational theory in regard of and you as an outsider you wouldn't know what's in the book just by Reading lumen's literature notes because they are so brief um but that's probably because he knew very well what he wanted to take from it and also um he's sometimes treated literature in a way I would not recommend to students um very Loosely sometimes you have trouble when you look at up the sources um how did he get that from this text um so it sometimes bothers a little bit on um being a little bit too um a couple year about about the sources but um the chords version of my long convoluted answer is the unfortunate it depends it really depends on um your previous knowledge and what kind of text you're dealing with and um I always try to get to the frame of an argument and trying to give myself an account so I don't repeat what an author is saying and take take the frame he's presenting me as a given but try to understand okay what is the particular perspective it and that is often something which is not explicitly mentioned and it's a little bit like a daily training of um being aware of the frames we are presented with Lumen was really good at that I often read text by him just to understand the relationships between different um uh schools of thought that better um I think yeah yeah you can put it that way and that makes sense um may I ask one quick follow-up Michael or should I yeah go for it you do you take what I would call I guess commentary notes I'll be I'll be slightly procedures and say Tom eudic type notes essentially here's a passage and here's a commentary on that Passage that's one way of course of avoiding strict paraphrase or extended paraphrase which is hard I have a hard time when I'm reading something dense where I'm trying to capture a thick meaning so I'm right now I'm reading the theory of communicative action and I'm teaching it and so you know every paragraph has something to say so I'm I'm thinking I'm trying to break out of the overly close paraphrase problem and I'm wondering if he's commentary as a way of doing that make sense the question and take that as a comment yeah no yeah that was a comment it was a it was actually a question but it was a question that do you write commentary notes essentially yeah extended commentary here's a very brief you know three sentence summary two sentence summary of a extended passage and now I'm going to write commentary on that in your own words obviously um I always read with an i two words possible connections Within Myself um so uh the literature nodes tend to be commentary really but again when I'm not that familiar with the topic I there is a loop before that and that is just trying to get it right first before I think about do I agree do I not agree do I um can I connected with this or that um so then it's more like a learning exercise um but in terms of the title cast and I'm trying to to get to the uh commentary and the uh question okay how how is that important for for what I'm working on uh as soon as possible so so it sounds like the first the first step you're paraphrasing in in your in their words to get to get that learning and then once you feel you've gotten to that point then you can start putting commentary is that what I heard you say yeah exactly and sometimes it's you have immediate uh lee uh a reaction to to attacks and feel okay you got it you you know what what that argument is about and and sometimes it takes longer um okay and then um a couple other new Concepts and we'll raise the Pascal on uh the uh or pulling for in just a minute but the uh polish print the couple other words you brought up so there's this distinction of a literary literature note versus a commentary note and then you talked about framing an argument and then you talked about summarizing the perspective of an argument can you can you drill down on that a little bit more because I never really thought of that distinction of a literature note before right well um lumen collected his literature nailed separately to the rest of his permanent melts and permanent notes is a term I used um settled custom notes and um so the literature notes are in his analog uh subtle custom just um the reference on one side and then on the other side on page something it says this and Page seven it says something else and from what I understood is that she spent the day at University rather reading and taking literature notes and in the evening when he was at home where he had his um growth and his actual subtle casting he went through it and thought about okay how's this relevant for what I've written in my settle custom somewhere and um so this is the the important process um the the permanent notes of lumen are very close to his own development of thinking so um you have note sequences which you almost find um verbatim in manuscripts um with um while the literature notes um well maybe you have to distinguish he had basically um two areas of settle casting his first set of cousin was much closer to traditional uh note-taking system because the literature notes were more extensive they are more like excerpts and the emphasis was more on the literature he was reading and after a theoretical break he started with the second and last settled custom which was different in regard to the emphasis on his own thinking so here you have a much bigger disconnect between the literature notes which didn't seem that important anymore to really note sequences um where he developed his own thinking and what I find interesting um in teaching uh Sarah cousin is that it is a system that kind of forces you to make up your mind about what you're reading and what you're thinking you can't just collect stuff because in the moment you look for connections and not just tag stuff or points to in another note but to express the connection between two notes in a full sentence this is where the thinking uh happens and um this is what feels unfamiliar for many people because um this is not the way it's being taught in school and University um usually to develop your own thoughts uh follow your own questions uh instead of giving the best account about what someone else has written um so I like about the system that it's a constant reminder to to make up your mind and to specify what you what you're thinking and if you think two notes um belong together um the subtle cast and kind of asks me um well in what way uh is it is it the same uh just same idea just put differently is it a contradiction is it an extension of an idea um and this is what I find interesting about working with that settled person that I constantly feel um it's not letting me get away with how thoughts Half Baked ideas about it's somehow the same um I I know that looking into Old notes I need to have specified and explicitly put the relationship between two ideas and most often it's a difference it's not the same it seems similar uh to authors using the same words but it's actually different and then I and write something about in one way that's different and this is what I found um very useful and for you and for you and then we'll get to our questions in just a minute for you the um it's less about the tool but more about the thinking so when you're saying zettel costume you're not referring to a particular tool you're thinking about a methodology whatever tool that one may have correct yeah yeah I think that's I think that's a a critically important Point okay uh Pascal you've been hands up and up for a long time hello there oh thank you for giving me the chance to speak and yes hi zonkey I really love your book really enjoyed it so oh yes my name is Pascal so I work in transfusion medicine in the UK uh so I do all of uh research and transfusion but also I use I've used various programs in my life I I've used um uh zotero Devon think and oxygen to keep notes uh and and again they've been fantastic but uh recently I've got myself into uh Tinderbox and uh on I've managed to find myself a few templates of how to implement zettel custom Into The Tinderbox system which is a fantastic way of keeping my records now what was difficult for me before using options is trying to link them together uh with having a sort of display name so it was um we had to put various uh uh I want to put this we we've tinned a box you can have um you can make it your own way so my latest updated Tinderbox or zettel custom if you will I have a lot of my notes in on in um in one of the folders we'll call them and it's linked up to so many notes uh and I find my what what's been very but it's been much better for me is to be able to find My Notes within zazetto castan uh because there's a lot a lot of notes that I put in there but it's about finding where you will pick them up and which one you want to include into my notes now what are the things we've uh Tinder Box but I've found as well was um because I used in the Box for various thing called projects for for my research uh but also for doing investigation at the hospital for example uh and um obviously I can't put them into one file of Tinderbox I have separate tint of Tinderbox files and so um the difference I think with Lumen he was always coming back home where we've won particular settle cast and looking through his notes and trying to make sense of what he's picked up throughout the day and to link them within his little cast and but for me um I I it's about one finding the time to go into myself in an evening and try to pick up the things that I've read and try to link them together so that's kind kind of my I find quite difficult his time but also um to actually go back into mazdatocaster every day to find the right length um I'd also to remember which node it's linked up to basically you had to read all the notes and I find The Tinderbox you're able to use something called display expression where they will you be able to look um at uh the note itself and it will give you an idea where you want to put it whereas with oxygen you almost have to maybe I'm not using it correctly but you almost had to read for a lot of your notes with the date and and to find which note it will be you'll be able to link it up together so that's my observation thank you oxygen or oxygen a number of times I'm not hearing it properly can you put a link to the obsidian obsidian yeah can you put that in the uh the link to the app so so obsidian reaction you Pascal I I um I need to look that up and how halting the Box uh um solves that problem I I do think that digitally you have the opportunity to have different areas of your subtle cast and which are structured differently so the pen and paper um works well with Note sequences where you extend ideas and put a thought to another thought plus you have the hyperlinks but the main characteristic is really these uh this kind of note sequences and um whenever I uh speak with people from your profession um the same uh problem arises and that is that he first of all you deal with a lot of new information that's constantly coming up and secondly you have to quickly um find what you need in a particular situation and I don't think there is a good solution at the moment from what I gather for uh in in the whole area of medicine but I think the digital Solutions be it obsidian and obviously Tinderbox SCA described it have the ability well you you can have a very hierarchical and structured area and at the same time uh parts of this structure can also be parts of a more Loosely structured cytical note sequence area so um I I have areas in my total custom which are highly structured this is more where I collect methods or questions when I do coaching or counseling because I want them at hand it's sometimes also the case that I think about them as part of an ongoing process is the right method um what are new findings about the efficiency of this method so I can link to them from other areas whereas more about research but I want to have this structured if if you deal with someone with anxiety you want to know uh what questions make sense and what are good reminders for yourself and I I can only assume it's similar um in in your field um probably more complex um but it's good to have the opportunity um instead of trying to use a research tool like lumen subtlecastle for um another kind of um information which is um yeah must be treated differently I guess I hope that makes sense too yes thank you and I'm a test you've been incredibly patient you're up but yeah so I was admitted yeah thank you um so I I'm a scientist and I work in the like chemistry and physics mostly also in the laboratory and there was the the the one Connecting Point which Professor Aaron said about the people working in the laboratory that and very often you know when you when you have a boiling acid in one hand and you need to write some observation you need to be very brief and you need to quickly note something which you will also be able to understand your observation and also often your students or other people also need to understand so there's this connection uh where we have to quickly form up formulate the the observation the problem and as briefly as possible and yeah this is something which really helped me also from your book and um jumping to my next comment about the question of Professor of Professor Friedland I also had the problem with the with the dance text reading the dance text and again Professor Aarons came to the rescue here because one one of the sentences which really resonated with me was that if you if you read something and you don't take the the nodes or the proper notes it's like you basically waste your time like if if you don't if you don't um put it into your own words which will force you to like we will check you check if you understand the problem and then we'll force you to briefly and relatively precisely formulate the problem and write it down then uh yeah you at some point you will just lose the time and what what helped me with those kind of things is I I needed to be to put some discipline on myself and really ask the questions all the time which parts are useful for me and when something is new everything seems to be useful but if you really focus on the things which which are useful at the moment and then you maybe put some comment that more on this or more on that subject you can find in this in this literature then you can you can go back to to it afterwards after you you forget maybe so what helped me in in short was to put in this discipline and really like I should focus on this I'm reading this book because I I try to learn about this specific problem or project thank you fantastic thank you for that yeah any uh any comment lucky or you may want to move on if your reaction the only comment is I'm um I'm always fascinated with laboratory notes um because um it's such a special genre of writing um so um there's great research from the development of laboratory notes how pacts um slowly become visible and have first informal names um yeah but but that's more a footnote uh comment hopefully hopefully you took away from that too how much you've impacted people and you're loved I mean everyone to a person said I've read your book and you've changed me so that's that's pretty cool um uh Joan you wanna jump in sure I have a question um hi we read your book in a book club of Rome research a couple of years ago along with how to read a book and you were foundational in setting up my way of processing information going forward um I had come to a point where I had read hundreds and hundreds of books and treaties and articles and it's turned the corner on productivity and understanding and information processing um I continue to use Rome research I do quantitative research but I use that information so I have that piece in the background but I use that information to inform creative teams on messaging so I take one part of my brain and then I put it into visualization so that creative people can then create advertising and messaging from it so I sort of straddle both and what I've noticed and working with Rome research is that I now see my brain patterns much more clearly it's literally when I work in it I can see my brain functioning and other people that I've spoken to since I become part of this PKM world is that people understand how their brains work much better and it really engages them and they feel like they're doing better thinking better writing better insights and I wanted to hear from you if one you've been part of that conversation or have heard those comments um and what your response to that it's an intuitive place to to land but I was wondering what if you had comments and insights on that um I I heard before that um it's the way um if you manage to come up with a system that works for you because I I still think um that um the subtle custom method is not a method you can just apply as a tool and then it works with magic you have to understand um the principles of it and then translate it into your own workflow and adapt it to your own needs just like you described it um how you did it for yourself and I think this adoption process um seemed to um force people to become more aware of their own thinking patterns and what they need from a note taking system and um then come up with with a structure that works for them so I think what you described is very much this translation process and when it works it's because you translated it um by being aware of your research needs and how note taking place into that and the title custom is probably just like a legal set of a few principles a few ideas and then you take the legal and build something your own but while you're building it consciously instead of just using a tool that is available or was taught in school um I very much can relate to what you described that it makes you more aware of um how you're thinking process works how it's structured and by being more aware of it you gain influence of it you can make decisions um oh maybe it's better I do this maybe um it's um better to be explicit about the relationships because I get the feedback when I come back to my notes and there is no uh description of the relationship there's just a link to another note I I'm getting frustrated so from now on uh I'm doing my future self a favor and doing what I um learned works best as a user so um it's probably the integrated feedback loop that allows you to to improve on on the thinking and note-taking and how it's interlocked so um yeah I can relate to what you said and it's something I I heard before interestingly with different kinds of setups and different kinds of tools um some was wrong some with obsidian um and now obviously and Tinderbox as well thank you you know that makes me think of another concept we often discuss in the in the community is this idea of incremental formalization and I and I believe that's kind of what you just said in that yo you'll take a note and then along the way you'll realize wait a minute I I didn't add something in what I should have or and then at that moment you can go ahead and add it and then what you realize is if you find yourself adding that kind of thing back multiple times then you'll realize then at the very beginning you'll learn at least that's what I've taught myself is that once I've been like found that I needed to be adding that thing two or three times then from the very beginning I start adding it immediately because of you know being kind to my future self I know my future self is going to want it whereas before I used to collect everything and then that was inefficient so then I collected what I was thinking I needed to know and I've learned the incremental formalization will then help me improve along the way uh does that make sense or totally and I'm going to steal that expression because I like it awesome all right uh uh you had a follow-up question then we'll go to Kim if I wouldn't ask this question Professor Evans I'm on the like younger side of the receiving I guess audience of your book and what the first thing which really resonates with me was your um let's say anarch anarchistic approach to the current you know manuals of research writing and all those things and I was wondering did you have any like negative response from the maybe the authors of the of those kind of books or maybe your professor colleagues at your University or something that well basically you yeah disapprove a lot of very um established theories about how one or students should learn um what first of all I'm the the professor title was already borrowed I'm not at the University currently um I'm freelancing um but well well the funny thing is um even though I worked in philosophy of education pedagogy and where you would think questions like uh writing note-taking learning um introductions into academic work should play a big role it's not really discussed um among my colleagues um it's it's it's a bit of a curiosity that I've written a book on note-taking but it's not discussed within the field there it's about more theoretical development philosophy education and it's it's almost like you have written a novel um it's something you mentioned uh in the coffee break but it's not really discussed and I haven't spoken with um um [Music] colleagues who follow a more systematic less anarchistic approach to note taking to use your words um but I often feel many of these introductory books um uh written not from a theoretical standpoint but more from an idea of how they think uh writing and note-taking works but it doesn't really it's a little bit like um when you speak with scientists and then hear what they say they do and then they when you look what they actually do it's often quite different um these um approaches where you go through these seven steps of reading understanding asking questions I don't know if anyone actually ever approached a text like this um looking at the title first and then deciding do I read it do I read it not um uh it's sometimes it it's a little bit like fantasy literature um yeah but I I haven't really had brutal discussions about that and and I like the idea that you put something out there and people can resonate with it and use it to their advantage we could as they needed and um if it doesn't work then here was another approach and um it's certainly not the only approach that works and it's probably works for a particular kind of um personality or interest even though some some things I would defend as universal like he should choose your system in a way that it counteracts to confirmation boys and not set your own writing up in a way that um increases your confirmation bias and I think technology can help with that a lot hey thank you hey uh Kim you're up yeah I had a question about how to set up the uh the actual case in terms of the index environment in terms of the you have your flea notes your literature notes purple notes and they're you're trying to set up relationships as sort of a daily management concept but you're trying how do you actually set up the index itself and I can never go I never got I read your books uh phenomenal uh books and thank you uh pretty much to meet with you today but what is how do you index it I mean I know we got links you can link things together but how do you set up the index thank you right um well Lumen himself had a typed on a typewriter typed index just alphabetically assorted um pointing not to every note that is related to a certain concept but more like I would call them but that's my um terminology entry notes so like when you point to a certain note you know okay that's a good way into the topic and sometimes it's what someone like Nick Milo might call maps of content so in Lumen settle custom you also I have this um concept notes um which points you in different directions so if you look up systems theory you might see specified links to um social systems um mechanical systems family systems Etc so that from the index you get from systems theory a link to this map of content where then you're distributed to different areas but that index is mapped out right you just you have to have the index abbreviated some way uh to tied it into maybe uh your link does that make sense well lumos was alphabetically sorted so what do you have in the digital version is of course um it Greater uh ability to um give yourself an overview um first of all you have the full text search so you know that you don't have to bother too much with indexing but whenever um you encounter a problem with complexity um when you search for something and two too many um uh results come up then it's often a good idea uh to write yourself something like an entry note um where you categorize um like Newman did on this maps of content cards so um it's a top down and bottom up approach in a way so whenever I feel it's getting too complex so I give myself an overview um I do have an alphabetic index but that's just that when I have a concept usually one word titles um that I give it an index tag so in the index it would just appear as an alphabetical list but um I also have an overview um like a dashboard or a starting page where I put more descriptive uh or notes with more descriptive titles which work like entry notes into a particular topic so it's not so much like in the index card where I point to different ways of speaking about systems or different ways of discussing ideology but from the starting page I point to my discussion of the problem with ideology in systems theory because I know okay that that's a topic um I have a lot of notes on and when I start with that note um I can go from there and it's top down and bottom up because whenever I feel okay there is a cluster building um I'm on um to add to that and um deliberately think about that so it's um it's getting onto the starting page but also especially in the beginning when you start with a set of cousin as you don't start from scratch it kind of makes sense to begin with a kind of brain down write down okay what are the questions I'm already thinking about and um use these um starting uh notes as a kind of backbone um so you have something to add to later um so the starting page will be mocs are also the plays within the subtle cast where you can deliberately think about is this something I actually want to work on I want to keep working on um or is it something that um it's it's not that much of an interest to me um so that that's a way of giving yourself an overview um yeah so index more alphabetic index pointing to one word titles and more topic um overview pointing more to notes with descriptive titles where you know okay there's a particular question being discussed thank you Doctor awesome thank you for insights and when you refer to Nick Milo it was Nick m-i-l-o and this idea of mapping of content is that what you're referring to yeah um I mean he stresses the idea of maps of content so I feel obliged to uh mention this name um uh um and I think it makes sense to to have this loose structure um that whenever you have too many notes within a cluster you give yourself an overview over that cluster on a new note and point to that note as the entry note um it makes sense yeah no no totally we just I've not heard that term before or that person before yeah we're adding them to the index of learning so that's awesome yeah good gotcha um anybody else have another comment thought questions about how we evolve this if not let's pop over to the uh while you're waiting for that so Fidel it wasn't actually Dominique Dominique had question two but Fidel had a comment last week that said um how does one avoid overwhelm you know after a while the slip box becomes massive for me uh how does one uh you know catalyze revision so that's some comments that Fidel gave us uh in the Forum can you respond to those two questions um it's a problem um and I treat it as part of the process um so what I described with um giving yourself an overview um that's often triggered by the feeling of being unoverwhelmed with something I have too many notes um I'm not sure where should I go I take that as a feedback that I should give myself overview over a note so um it's this system Theory idea of complexity builds app um just by itself that's the nature of things and then you have to invent something that reduces the complexity again and after having reduced the complexity uh now you can build up because you have more capacity for it generally um there is sometimes a different kind of overwhelm occurring and that is when people feel obliged to follow all Loose Ends um like like a zero inbox idea and that is impossible um when you yeah when you have uh something like a set of person where almost every note could be expanded on commented on and this is I think lesser technical um problem and more a question of the mindset uh you approach um this problem and um my solution to that is that those ideas and questions I find extremely important and I don't want to lose sight of um they will have the place on my starting page dashboard or one of the mocs everything else is um approached by Me was a kind of abundancy mindset that I don't feel I need to respond to every question in my subtle question I don't need to follow up all those ends on the contrary it's great to have more possibilities to follow up on than I have time to actually do so I I try to turn it around and think about it as well thankfully um I have a title cousin full of possibilities to continue working on um and when I add an idea um I don't have to follow it to the end I can just write down well interesting article from Michael Becker about dinner Brock's um in a way if I um in the future discuss that question look that up I don't have to look it up now um but it's noted I can pick up the thread in the future but I don't have to um so I I don't have a to-do list uh idea about my notes you leave yourself a breadcrumb if you will um exactly yeah and that goes back to the point I think that was being said later in that if you don't leave yourself that breadcrumb you're wasting time because you're eventually gonna have to find it again so if you give yourself that breadcrumb in the moment you can you can save yourself a ton of time from having to backtrack yeah okay um all right and then any other comments thoughts Mr Bernstein what how are you how are you how is this molding over for you you're on mute by the way there oh I'm just taking lots of notes yeah yeah me too it's really good um all right any other thoughts who else has some other Concepts like maybe um yeah Ian you've been you've been quiet as of many of you and Dave Rogers you you and art you tend to have ample comments maybe you guys can chime in and give us some of your reactions I'm enjoying this I don't um I read a lot I I feel as though I don't do myself a service by taking good notes I do a lot of highlighting and uh I probably should go back and and organize those somehow but I'm I'm happy to listen in and uh and get inspired I'm seeing a lot of good comments in the uh in the chat so well and I but I think that I think I think you just raised a really important point that we need to go back to and Professor earns is already mentioned this several times but there's this idea of that initial and we talked about this with um Sasha last week as well there or a couple weeks ago now there's that initial note that you take which is like that raw note that's undefined and if you're if you've done yourself a service you'll have cited it immediately where did it come from but it's still super raw and then there's that next step that he I think you called it a prominent note or a permanent note Dr Ernst that that that then starts getting curated it starts becoming is put into your own words it's refined it's it very well maybe its own Atomic note being there but it then also May link itself back up to one of these cons um concept notes or entry notes as as you as you said and that's that curation process and I think what a lot of people want to do is they want to jump from that initial collection all the way to Creation but there's some steps in between that need to be gone through to be able to really you know to the incremental formalization Concepts that we were talking about earlier that are critically important it cannot be skipped now do you agree with that or what's your reaction to that kind of observation of uh of how we go about because Dave Rogers and called himself out on it he's like I take notes but then I never really go back and it sounds like that Going Back part is where knowledge and thinking is happening yeah well in defense uh to highlighting even though I I know I um I was very kind to highlighting in the book but um I I sometimes feel it's a necessary in between step um that goes back to what I said in the beginning it really depends on the kind of um text you're reading um sometimes you need that in between step of highlighting first and then going through it a second time because only when you have read the whole thing you know um how certain arguments make sense or not and then you have the highlights and that's a good indication to jump back in and then take notes from there um but it's an in-between step it's not uh the alternative to write something about it in your own words so if you can skip the highlighting um uh step um great because then you can uh come as quickly as possible to where the actual thinking is happening and that is asking all the questions about how is this information relevant for what I have already written down somewhere else which after a while becomes equivalent to um things I'm thinking about um instead of thinking about what I'm thinking about you can just look into your setup custom because what you're thinking about is somewhere there and if it's not there you probably have not thought about it yet um so yeah I I just agree that um you have to immerse yourself in this step which sometimes feels a bit like it's slowing you down but I believe that's where new ideas are generated um spending some time with the questions of how is it related what's the importance of it um is there a counter argument Etc and being explicit about that writing it down brings your work forward yeah awesome art you haven't spoken yet oh yeah hi thanks for doing this Sirens um I have a question relating to the ingestion of ideas and and so you know I notice you've been holding a pen for a period during this uh this Meetup and you know my question is like we're Gathering thoughts and we're coming up with ideas ever more rapidly and uh they're coming in at perhaps opportunity in opportune times you may be near your computer you may be in inputting something into your mobile phone there are pen and paper and and and the old analog system has its own beautiful advantages and then of course there's a then the challenge of translating some of that into a into a computer system you know which sort of then ultimately contributes to your knowledge base my question is uh how do you manage um you mean what kind of tools I actually use not necessarily the tools because I I believe like the tools again you know can be found um to suit your requirements and everybody thinks differently but just in terms of your your ideological attitude towards um um okay now I'm taking this note how am I going to deal with it how am I ultimately going to get it into my uh what's the path your mind follows right um well I have a lot of different kinds of inboxes so to speak um so um when I'm on a walk um I um use my phone to take um audio notes and um I'm not very disciplined and going through them on the same day which would probably make sense um but they are they are there once in a while I go through them and check half of them because it's just one of these ideas that sounded good to me in in the moment uh but not an hour later um at play as well like okay it's an idea that comes from abundance you're on a walk 20 ideas yeah don't necessarily have to act exactly if it's really an idea I feel okay that that's a breakthrough then I set myself a reminder on my calendar um so it pops up um but if it's just on the list of audio notes um I go through it when it's convenient the same is with um having a paper notebook with me all the time I used that less for um touching ideas and more to elaborate on vague ideas I like scribbling around and drawing lines and write down what I don't want to forget often trivial things I just like the whole physical appeal of paper notebook um it's a way of being more peaceful um in my mind it's like um my thoughts are grounded in a way and if I don't know if that metaphor makes any sense to you but I feel if I just rely on my head alone they tend to spin around and the moment I have a pen in my hand and a paper in front of me um it's um yeah it it grounds them somehow um like even if you're doodling you're creating sort of the bounds and the structure of what you're up to yeah yeah for sure yeah and then I at the moment uh I I use a remarkable uh in e-paper uh notebook um but that's very specific because it's not really integrated into any other system it's just when I have meetings with people um I uh I think I might meet again or I like to meet again but I have just a collection of meeting notes um at hand and I wouldn't want to type while we are talking I think it's impolite um especially when my microphone is on um and it's also a bit random because sometimes it's just words and or things I want to look up someone had an idea I want to look up um so meeting notes um have their special place and um it's also a bit of journaling that it's more private that I feel I wanna um use um a proper handwriting tool with even though it's an eve uh tool but it it works in the same way I suspect going back to the brain though too there might be something with that physical connection behind your brain I mean I don't I don't know this but maybe moving your hand actually does something in the brain and laying down the pathways of the information well there are two things that I I noticed um first of all that's well known it slows you down and it's slowing down your own thoughts it's very helpful um but secondly um editing is so much more of a hassle and when I type I'm constantly rewriting a sentence when I write by hand I wouldn't constantly cross out what I've written um so I'm a little bit more deliberate and a little bit more forgiving with imperfect sentences so it's more likely that I fill a page when I have a pen in my hand just because there's a little bit of a higher threshold to editing um and I find that for rough drafts or for preparations for talks um extremely helpful because in the end you have a page full of ideas and I think twice about doing that again um so it's a kind of psychological trick on myself I guess so is there a log Jam and you're getting all of this into your final into your settle custom is there a point at which there there's a bit of a choke okay what's going to go in now how much time I'm going to devote to just grooming and and maintaining my my database how much time and how am I going to take these different sources analog a digital and from my voice recording um when there isn't like if I encounter an idea I find really valuable I make myself an out to to put them in subtle custom or go directly to it um okay but it's I I don't have such a um perfect routine with a dedicated time during the day where I go through it it's more I sometimes feel not um focused enough to continue working on a manuscript or uh and then it's it still works going through my notes and thinking about okay how can I combine it with what I've already written it's it's more like a um concentration question or um what kind of mood I am or what phase in a project I am so sometimes I'm working on a manuscript and I wouldn't touch my setup custom for days because now it's getting about okay it's it's about reviewing and going through the reviews and things like that and sometimes it's reading a book and I don't want to be distracted but for sure getting into the ideas of someone else um real quick though in that and I think there's a tendency that we've had in The Tinderbox Community where is you know is Tinderbox a settle constant or not is is is is it this kind of tool or not and you mentioned like sometimes I'll go days without touching my zettle costume as if it was you know and in your context and your implementation is as if it's something different and I think what's important for The Tinderbox Community for like for myself if you go to the extreme Tinderbox is both my subtle costume but it's also my writing environment it's also my publishing environment it's also so there's way and going back to Kim's point on indexing you know there's ways to set up your Tinderbox file so on you know off to the side is your Atomic notes your permanent notes your your the things you haven't curated and then over here is your writing and the template you're applying to it and your ability so I've used Tinderbox to publish literally 500 page reports right and those 500 page reports are then back to their permanent notes and then often their semi-un permanent notes so there's this this extreme of from The Collection stage to your contribution AKA your output and then we all invariably will use different tools at different times to help us get there yeah and and we were just talking about this last week where someone was says well is Tinder boxes that will cost it or not and the answer is yes or no it just depends on how you're choosing to use it any other tool so I just wanted to interject that comment or statement makes sense um uh all right anything else before we move on oh no no thanks so much for your answer I really appreciate it um you've been up for longer than Pascal so you jump back in yeah I I really like this idea of the multiple inboxes uh I was just going to say that like when I was in the meeting like face-to-face meetings like people really take it um well in a bad way when you start typing on your phone right or even laptop like so this is where I usually borrow the the iPad from my wife and I I write something with it with the pen because I like the digital uh the digital advantage of search later on and this is really like I think closely related to David's Islands right getting things done like you really have this peace of mind right when you um first of all when you write down what's what's on your what's on your mind or dictate like when you said you you when you are on a walk but the the second thing is I think the peace of mind is only uh like real when you know that you will come back to it like David Allens has this review um of all the notes uh idea which very closely relates to the Central Casting um processing of the fleeting notes right I think and and this connects more to the to the highlights which I think we could fix the problem of highlights if we treated them like fleeting notes so if we go back to them and process them then I think there is nothing wrong with the with the with the highlights I think the danger is that we often don't go back like in time when we are still when we still know why did we even highlighted this and then then this may become a problem yeah and you you miss this you missed this last week but on that very Point that's where uh Sasha had said even on those fleeting notes grab context right the second you create a fleeting note well why did you take that leave yourself that little context clue so that you will help you to be able to Circle back when you want to when you want to evolve it and I think that's really an important point you just made yeah but you know you you always think like I will know right I I I'm just highlighting it but yeah of course there's this this is the danger yeah I think yeah yeah especially if you're super busy you may forget within 20 minutes I mean you just got a lot going on your head and you're certainly forget in a couple of weeks uh um anything else no thank you awesome thanks uh Pascal oh thank you I think Massey is kind of pretty better than I was going to put it here um so I used to highlight as well in a lot of my books and I ended up reading the books again because um I couldn't remember what I highlighted these things but now I definitely just write everything so I use Devin think to kind of write my little notes I use my the iron insertion excuse me to write a little note and uh so then it shows into my inbox and when I get to my computer in the evening then I know I need to process and try to find this and add this to my Zephyr Castle in uh my Tinderbox um yeah and I use these as you said the fleeting knows pretty much what you said about the uh the inbox will be uh the first units would be in my inbox rather if I'm using a highlighted bit but yeah I agree with you awesome all right any other comments points reactions deadlift you've been super quiet we haven't heard from you in a while what's what's your uh which how are you reacting to this oh thanks for asking me directly I'm just listening and uh I'm uh there are so many um good Inspirations for me um I'm still working on my settled customer redesigning it whenever I have time I have a little bit to a high workload at the moment but um for me my the problem is linking uh of the notes um because for me a node is always um something more or less static and um I don't know my my thinking is uh evolving my thinking is changing over time but my nodes are aesthetic and that's my main problem with my digital title castle that I would like to uh the links is what solves my problem I I think but um I'm still not not very not too satisfied with how I'm doing it at the moment to get a more Dynamic approach to um to reorganizing uh the the the thinking um or no the the the knowledge that is in my notes and um I do like Tinderbox um for this approach because uh with the agents um dinner box is a very powerful tool to rearrange your notes and to um to later on have an idea and then to collect all the nodes that fit to this idea and that is that's what I'm trying to solve but I'm I'm still working on it and that look just to jump in on that real quick let me show you this and I think this really helps just for those people that are looking at this too so for those that are not familiar with Tinderbox this is a Tinderbox file let me go find you all again and you know here's a great example of I got a quote um let me go find that example here so if I go down here so you see I was I was interacting with a buddy of mine called Dixon uh his name's Dixon he works for Fujitsu and you know there's a lot going on here so you'll notice I went ahead and in this field where I say person I add in Dixon's name and I've got action code behind the scenes that automatically creates a note for me if it doesn't already exist called Dixon so this way I can go ahead and insert you know the permanent note that is the curated person that is Dixon here in this note and I got this quote for him for this event that we're going to be doing I then was able to take this and now this so I've got now two permanent notes I've got a note called Dixon and I now have a quote from Dixon on this particular day that's also using hook sort of searched to his permanent permission and consent that he's given me for using this quote I then can roll up and I've got another note I then call Post which is now another permanent note which is related to um the comment that I'm going to be making about the quote that Dixon did you know Dixon's great it's really interesting all that and then there's the picture of the of the quote that we've made but what's interesting there in terms of linking I now have another attribute called term very similar to person and there anything I'm writing in here will be automatically generating a term if it doesn't already exist and then linking to that term at which point then I could go in then Define those terms and so this process is now letting me create even more persistent notes and all of that is happening automatically and then I can then go back and incrementally evolve it and and handle that over time and then then one letter better one last kind of thing and showing this demonstration is that's like the input and curation methods and then it's the creation for me comes from then I'm reading that that Dixon's quote and I can start writing about what that means to me so that's now making it a commenting approach and then going to the method of publishing if you're then going to social media yo using hashtags and mention tags are critical in social media to drive attraction so leveraging Tinderbox templates I'm then able to then have Tinderbox automatically using action code create the hashtag and mention Cloud for me so then when I turn around and post this into LinkedIn for instance that happens all automatically as well so this kind of gives you an example for those that might be listening how you could a great example of using Tinderbox to collect some notes in the process of curation have that process create more notes even for you and then allow you to facilitate using the templating function to actually have immediate output um and that if you're if you're interested in that we can talk about that later uh happy to share how I'm doing that um yeah Pascal and uh Mateus you raise your hands real quick yeah sorry just very quickly to add to this I think the the danger around having a digital version um with this is I think with Lumen he was constantly looking at where this specie collection connection was happening whether this where would this fit in whereas if you have something quite automatic that you just put it under uh digitally will just link up to that note would you then go back to read the original knowledge before to eventually whether it's linking up to the to the new node so I think this is um an area we might need to look into at how to make sure that we go back and read the original note if that makes sense it totally does and by the way it just shined up uh you're in the in the um and the chat just brought up a really important point he says my zetel cost and my writing my environment my publishing environment this is also a risk for those who use emacs personally I find it helpful to switch between tools uh your I absolutely agree with you so what I tend to find is when I actually start to go try to publish the stuff I've written in xender in Tinderbox going into the new environment like LinkedIn or like word or like PowerPoint you know and Marshall mcluhan taught us this in 1964 the medium's the message as I'm going out of the medium that is Tinderbox and I start to use that message that stuff that I think is just so brilliant and I start putting it into the LinkedIn environment I realize well wait a minute this content's not really working in this particular environment so at that point of publishing in that new tool all I will invariably will be making changes and I and that absolutely happens as I go to word PowerPoint or any other Medium as well so I think there it's it's not all one tool all of these other tools do again macclennan had it right the medium is the message the medium you have used will influence your message your message will influence the medium so I think that's another good learning from from this all right we've got we're just starting to run over but we had another a couple other questions somebody else raised their hand but then dropped it who was it do I think it was Oliver yeah Oliver go for it yeah thank you very much uh Michael um I was a little bit dropping out so I don't know exactly the way of the discussion that was going but um uh to the point that sometimes the two are extension of our personal environments and brains everyone has its own tool and what you just showed Michael is the way you design your external brain and for someone else someone else it doesn't mean a thing right so it's it's the way it's it's tailored to your thinking and somehow Tinderbox allows you to create this kind of management environment to have this information flowing through you and that's what Nicholas Lumen when I turned to the beginning of the discussion also was saying that his settle cost is his communication partner right he's uh requesting things from him and so on and um I personally am still looking for my external brain I'm I'm working with Tinderbox on and off and I'm using it since I think 30 years when storybook came by I I was a storybook user first and I never came down to the one tool and I regret this I I'm always looking for uh for the best way and maybe I'm the one type that never can settle with one Tool uh because I'm constantly when I said it was one tool I constantly look at the features of another tool saying ah maybe you make it one decision uh let's go somewhere else and maybe What circus is telling us it's up to two it's uh it's the way you think and that needs to settle uh how do you deconstruct what you find reconstruct what you think and then construct for the environment where you publish and talk to right this is the deconstruct reconstruct construct segment and everyone has his own uh way of doing it so and then sometimes the two comes by and helps you a little bit like a protasis or something yeah it gives you a little kick and and and and speed you up in a sense but um what I'm learning from the discussions and the meetups that you do is what all kind of different ways people try to go down to solve this problem for themselves so I'm Amazed by all this creativity that you all have and trying to solve this everyone has the same problem yeah but everyone has an own way of solving it sometimes somehow Zoom could try to suggest one way but I'm not sure if if that's has he ever got the impression that people just take on his suggestions or do they just change those suggestions for the personal uh knowledge work I don't know maybe Mr orange could answer this go for it thank you uh stanky you're on mute sorry uh it resonates with something Joanne said earlier about uh the or how she described to tweak the tool to her own needs and um I think you're absolutely right that's that that that's how it works and it comes with the effect of probably being more aware of our thinking and how we structure it and um being more aware of the pros and cons of different tools um which probably wasn't that much of a discussion when there weren't so many different uh variations available but but I think you're absolutely right and that so we need go ahead so it's it's like it forces you to think about thinking right and and and design the design and so on it's a meta role yeah yeah the tools are kind of part of the metacognitive skills um that um that are interesting in themselves and maybe people who are drawn to trying out different things uh are also motivated by trying out how it affects the thinking so so it's maybe more than just The Shining you uh object problem it's maybe a curiosity about um thinking of Thanos and um it's a good thing isn't it so we are running a little late but we have two questions left and I want to make one comment just talking about now I'll start with the comment first I was talking to somebody out the other day and they're like well what's you know you know what's the best email client she asked me and I'm like well the reality is I actually use four email clients and I have one that I primarily use for my every of my everyday email emailing because I I prefer its UI I prefer some of the capability it gives me but when it comes down to Mac Mail I use the Mac Mail as well because it allows me to use hook and other things that the other client doesn't allow me to use and then when I need to perform search I use mailmate because mailmate is a markdown functionality and a better search function than any of the other ones all combined so you know just like a um you know when a construction person goes to a job they very well may have three or four different kinds of hammers they're all called the category of hammer but you know each of the different you know there's a rubber Hammer there's a larger Mallet you know sometimes the category of hammer you need two or three to be able to address your need in a particular job so getting hung up on one tool I think is dangerous uh frankly um but at the same time going overboard and having too many tools can also become problematic too you got to find that balance for yourself that's my comment uh two last questions um Fidel foreign thanks so much for this conversation it's been really useful I came a little bit late so I don't know if this has been handled and I had started reading uh smart notes I do confess that I did not finish reading the book uh this was maybe two three years ago my question is to uh is is so I'm just thinking uh what you said what you said about longhand really resonated powerfully with me and the reason it did was because I found that writing longhand is the thing which enabled me to finally finish writing a manuscript of a novel like just doing it digitally couldn't hack I couldn't do it and when I when I went long hand I finished it so what you said really resonated and my question to you is with zettel Casten and um let's say I've got some index cards I've got a physical index I've got physical index cards and um of my literature notes and my fleeting notes Etc and I'm trying now to like bring them together and construct meaning could you just talk me through what that process could look like with some physical cards like I know it's probably like look at this one look at that one put this together put that together but from your experience like I don't know if you just give like a snapshot overview of some of the steps what that would look like if it's possible first of all congratulations on finishing a manuscript that's always a big thing isn't it yes thank you and um so you're using an analog paper pen and paper based type of custom yes yes um have you come using a digital index in addition to the paper type of cousin because um I think it can work well together that you have the advantages of writing longhand um have the physical advantages of having the paper arranged and so on but the index um might work better in um just having a digital alphabetical list pointing to paper um that's how I would approach it if I decided to to go analog I'm not completely because the index can digitally be modified more easily um the alternative would be having smaller cards um alphabetically sorted very much like in a library um and then you can have on the cards also uh like mocs or hubs where you can point to different uh aspects but you have the problem yes these are not fixed notes but developing notes um you kind of have to squeeze in between and um but it worked for Lumen he he typed it and Captain index separately um but as a recommendation on a quick note I I would have a digital list um it can just be in text file um nothing fancy okay all right all right and uh we're gonna we're way over time but Matisse you get the last word what's your final question okay my final question is Dr irons what what stops you from making a Wikipedia type of notes like what would or or I should we call them like what would be your tips for let's say beginner um Advocates of settle custom uh wrong from doing a Wikipedia type of Etc content which means I mean by that that I think everything will be useful I want to put everything I I use I work in in science so I would like all the data everything under my hand but this is just not not possible due to time constraints what what would be something you you could say about that to help work the distinction is really important I I believe so I think it's an important question and to me it it helps um to keep in mind well if I just want to have information that's what the internet is for what actual Wikipedia is for because I can always look it up but when it comes to writing uh settled from a settled person I'm in a dialogue with um a communication partner and like with an actual uh partner I'm very familiar with I'm spending a life with um we don't have to tell each other everything all the time again and again we kind of know stuff so we can leave much bigger gaps than when we had to speak with someone else so I only write down what I assume I would forget otherwise I'm writing on the edges on the borders of my understanding so when I write something down then because I'm not yet really um clear about something it's it's a pro process of understanding of going beyond my current understanding it's not about recording what I already know and um so maybe that's a good or helpful metaphor that first of all you speak with someone who knows you very well so no need to explain everything all the time again and again and secondly it's about thinking on the borders of your understanding so if you struggle a bit to find the right words then it's good if it feels like a jaw where you just have to write down what's on your mind then it's probably not worth writing it down in the first place but that would be my answer uh excellent thank you I'm just writing that down I mean that I think that's a really powerful concept because that's where the incremental formalization if you're struggling with that then allow yourself to go through those revisions all right well I personally could could keep you on for gazillion more years this was just awesome uh everyone was given me virtual or real Round of Applause or collapse this was fabulous thank you so much for taking the time I really appreciate it and thank you very much and we'll uh hopefully have you again one of these days and please try and we'll get you on a Mac so we get you to play with Tinderbox and get you part of the community all right well is that everybody thank you very much thank you last bye-bye thank you all right thank you thank you everybody oh I'm Mr Bernstein are you still around foreign",

Michael Becker hey everybody uh welcome to uh this week's Tinderbox May 7th is our Meetup uh and we're really and let me just kind of go through the the 10th um General format the general format is we go around the room and we have new people introduce themselves we've got a ton of those today um we'll then uh we tend to then talk about like what are we doing in this whole area of personal and learning Knowledge Management what tool skills are we using uh to accomplish that we'll then talk about how we're using Tinderbox to help us achieve those goals or any other tools within the community uh within the Frameworks to help us achieve those goals and then we dig into either uh specific problem solving that somebody may have um or will address a theme that we have for that particular event and today we've got a theme and if you don't mind let's skip some of the introductions of new people today because we don't want to waste any time at all uh and we have the uh and I'm gonna asanki arms how do I print I'm terrible at names is that okay I'm terrible with names as well okay and he is the author of how to take smart notes and and I have to tell you I'm I'm like so excited about this because I came across your book when it first came out and it was like raw eye dropping revolutionary for me and there were still some nuggets in there that I carry with me like every morning I wake up I'm like all right this is how to do it and it's been I'm just so grateful for you for having written it and helped me along my path and then I'm just terribly excited I'm kind of a groupie to have you actually be here and be able to share your thoughts and ideas with us so um so thank you uh and so with that in mind zonkey has agreed to join us and and just guide us in a discussion uh along his book uh on um how to take smart notes so um please use the chat please ask him questions let's have a really fertile dialogue and then in the end if we have time we can talk about Tinderbox stuff and all that but I suspect we won't so let's Jump Right In on it's okay you want to introduce yourself and uh help us guide us through the conversation sure um thank you for having me um yeah I'm the author of how to take smart notes um I it was a bit of a procrastination project I was writing on something else but then I felt um I needed to write a little bit about how I write because um the way uh writing is being taught in university is often so diameterally um different to how I worked that I felt I needed to have something for my students that is not misleading and the uh the main problem seemed to me that writing was often taught as an afterthought of thinking and in a very linear way so still people often ask for about my workflow assuming that you started at a certain point you get an idea you get an assignment you agreed to hand in an article then you start from that idea you do your research you do your reading then you write about what you read then you stop thinking about it and in the end you write it down and this also mirrors in a way a shift in philosophy about how we think about the relationship between writing and thinking um that's I was very interested in at the moment on a theoretical basis um so it was a nice opportunity to um still without actually mentioning the philosophy behind it the practicality of um certain um uh discussions which are more on an abstract level and also I was always interested in Nicholas Lumen and his work on uh social systems and System Theory in general so my background is a little bit um uh philosophy of education on the one hand with emphasis on social systems and sociology but in the other hand I'm a trained therapist and coach in systems therapy so um Nicholas Roman was also influential on that side and at the same time the subtle cousin was often more discussed as a curiosity and not really in relationship to the theory in itself and I wasn't always interested in in the relationship between the actual physical work of thinkers and the outcome so there's obviously no linear relationship no cause of a relationship but I don't think Lumen would have been able to um write such a complex Theory to develop such a complex Theory without the sophisticated external um brain where he can um delegate the complexity delegate the memory uh and focus on what the brain is actually very good in and that is making an association uh comparing things and it's so much easier to compare things when you have it in front of you so um yeah there was kind of the reason I was interested in um in writing that book and I think it's resonates with uh um a new development and or a new interest in the external brain or externalizing um ideas uh taking the material side of um um knowledge work more into consideration um but yeah so um I'm now more interested in where you want to pick up on um what questions you have because I assume that yes this is a regular Meetup you have certain lines of discussions and interests that are recurring and gear uh discussed with different people from different perspectives so I'm I'm happy to join in so Dominique I see you're online and in the Forum this week you talked about you know this idea of when you're taking notes how do you distinguish between you know that really rough note and the and the larger note and making them discoverable along the way and that whole process of curating knowledge and but before we bring him up I wanted to kind of comment when I was doing my um my my test for my doctoral uh uh process um I remember reading a book just prior to taking my test and they said writing was thinking and you know in the first what 38 years of my life no one ever bothered to tell me that and I think that the fact that you brought that up maybe you can talk a little bit about that more as well like how this process of writing is actually thinking um as opposed to documenting of simple documentation or what's the distinction for you yeah I mean there's this um wonderful book by any Murphy Paul uh I hope I get her name right um about the extended mind um and that is very much an overview over different research areas and the rediscovery of the importance of the outside of the brain so it makes a difference if you think alone or if you think with peers if you think with a pen in your hand or just staring at the wall or the blank page um I spend a lot of time reading about um history of Natural Sciences and work in the laboratory and there you find um a lot of um informal um ways in which scientists describe their work and they always seem to emphasize how they think with uh their tools and how um the um laboratory is in a way um the um The Horizon which in thinking happens and it would be um strange to reduce um the thinking uh into the brain and so there you find this um informal speech with just always treating the environment as part of the thinking process and at the same time a struggle on a um for philosophers of science to to grasp that concept because it's still very much representational uh with the idea it's about getting the outside insight and um yeah getting away from that clear Cartesian distinction between inside and outside I think discussions like you have can be very much put into this um new rediscovery of um the importance of um the extended mind okay and anybody have any reactions comments to that or thoughts I can chime in with more but um what do you think thoughts ideas like so what like you know it's also called the second brain right so what are your what is what would you recommend as the tools and the techniques for marrying this extended mind with um you know with our own internal self uh would you call it the internal and external and and how does that apply to your note-taking process right um well first of all the metaphors uh something worth discussing um the extended mind is certainly something different than a second brain um and maybe it's semantics but I often think behind the semantics is a certain idea about the relationship between the tools we use and um our own thinking um I don't think there is a um something you can recommend generally to everyone because obviously the tools of someone who's working in the laboratory are very different to the tools you use when you're a social scientist I'm obviously more drawn to lumens approach but when it comes to the question what digital tools do you use to replicate the subtle custom um and to transfer the analog into the digital um that is a more difficult problem than people often seem to realize because um you can't just imitate um the analog in the digital if you try to be as close as possible to the original uh pen and paper version I don't think you come up with the best solution I think coming up with the best solution means using uh the strength of the digital in in the best way possible and having more a loose idea about the analog as an um background idea um and I try not to fall into the Trap of the shiny new toy and um change um constantly between applications but my process was roughly I started with pen and paper I changed the format then in the early days I just had an HTML website where I linked manually in an editor then I had a mix of analog and digital because some things make more sense in digital having lists and indica Etc um and then I used wrong for a while and because I Was preparing an online course um and the requests were overwhelmingly for obsidian um I um looked closely closer at obsidian and um how much trouble it would be to transfer my notes into that make myself familiar enough to to be able to say something intelligent about it and now I kind of um sticking with that and um yeah that's right are you a Mac or a PC user I'm a PC user got it then that's probably why yeah so at some point when you and we won't do it now but if you're interested let's have a side conversation and I'll happily show you the uh The Tinderbox tool and I I think we'll I'll make it my my missionary my missionary objective to convert you into this back world it's pretty it's pretty darn cool but uh well that that's for a later dialogue Mr Lou you got your hands up been up a while yes thank you uh Dr Aarons I really appreciate your work I appreciate your being here with us today I have a very specific question about a kind of note-taking I'm also a social scientist I'm a sociologist I work in German social theory as a matter of fact so very close I've read lumon's work I've used lumon's work I primarily work on Harper Moss but I move back and forth my question is a very specific one when you're reading that kind of dense social theory that requires close reading line by line really even sometimes certainly paragraph by paragraph and you're trying to reconstruct a larger argument I understand the general principle of writing to internalize for yourself writing what this means to you but you're trying to capture a larger argument in the context of the the Zeto costume type program that you're that you're described that you write about how do you how do you do that one very specific kind of problem of reconstructing a dense argument from a series of you know attacks that basically where you can't simply say well I think he's saying this about the public sphere it's a very very specific kind of layered reconstruction what what do you how do you handle that and I by the way I use your book I I've given it to graduate students I've used it to teach graduate students and it's extremely useful thank you um can you hover mosque you made a reference to a name I've never heard couldn't couldn't even begin to spell it h-a-b-e-r-m-a-s Jurgen habermas he's a one of the leading German social theorists World social theorists one could say yeah okay um yeah um yeah that's it it could later share an anecdote to build Harbor miles but um to your point I think this this is really important to um well I I think I would now um generalize a little bit less than I've done in the book which was written with um uh students and young academics in mind which often [Music] um um spent have to spend a lot of time reconstructing complex arguments in their own words and not skipping that process by just copying pasting quotes Etc um this in my own teaching often what I feel most important and that's probably why I emphasized that but equally important is um not treating or text the same and there's a reason I assume you you mentioned a specific kind of dense text because you have to treat it differently to a popular science book with one idea which is then repeated in different examples and the art of note-taking or taking literature notes is really in realizing how much effort you have to put in uh relation to the text you're dealing with and it's maybe less about is it a dance text or a less dense tax but how familiar am I as a reader with the topic um I sometimes spend a lot of time with a book because I'm unfamiliar with the topic almost everything seems new and interesting to me so I write a lot of things down and then in the end I have to go back to the beginning because I have to rewrite something because I needed to understand something in the end of the book before I realized the importance of something that was mentioned in the beginning so these literature notes tend to be more like excerpts and a little bit more um um yeah longer and extensive but when I'm familiar with the topic I usually know what I want from a text um I'm interested in a particular argument I ignore everything that is um explained to readers who are new and maybe I don't even take a literature note but just extract what I need from it and put it directly into the subtle calcium as a comment um or a footnote or something like that Luman himself um had very brief literature notes so you often really have only a few words um on page seven it says something about organizational theory in regard of and you as an outsider you wouldn't know what's in the book just by Reading lumen's literature notes because they are so brief um but that's probably because he knew very well what he wanted to take from it and also um he's sometimes treated literature in a way I would not recommend to students um very Loosely sometimes you have trouble when you look at up the sources um how did he get that from this text um so it sometimes bothers a little bit on um being a little bit too um a couple year about about the sources but um the chords version of my long convoluted answer is the unfortunate it depends it really depends on um your previous knowledge and what kind of text you're dealing with and um I always try to get to the frame of an argument and trying to give myself an account so I don't repeat what an author is saying and take take the frame he's presenting me as a given but try to understand okay what is the particular perspective it and that is often something which is not explicitly mentioned and it's a little bit like a daily training of um being aware of the frames we are presented with Lumen was really good at that I often read text by him just to understand the relationships between different um uh schools of thought that better um I think yeah yeah you can put it that way and that makes sense um may I ask one quick follow-up Michael or should I yeah go for it you do you take what I would call I guess commentary notes I'll be I'll be slightly procedures and say Tom eudic type notes essentially here's a passage and here's a commentary on that Passage that's one way of course of avoiding strict paraphrase or extended paraphrase which is hard I have a hard time when I'm reading something dense where I'm trying to capture a thick meaning so I'm right now I'm reading the theory of communicative action and I'm teaching it and so you know every paragraph has something to say so I'm I'm thinking I'm trying to break out of the overly close paraphrase problem and I'm wondering if he's commentary as a way of doing that make sense the question and take that as a comment yeah no yeah that was a comment it was a it was actually a question but it was a question that do you write commentary notes essentially yeah extended commentary here's a very brief you know three sentence summary two sentence summary of a extended passage and now I'm going to write commentary on that in your own words obviously um I always read with an i two words possible connections Within Myself um so uh the literature nodes tend to be commentary really but again when I'm not that familiar with the topic I there is a loop before that and that is just trying to get it right first before I think about do I agree do I not agree do I um can I connected with this or that um so then it's more like a learning exercise um but in terms of the title cast and I'm trying to to get to the uh commentary and the uh question okay how how is that important for for what I'm working on uh as soon as possible so so it sounds like the first the first step you're paraphrasing in in your in their words to get to get that learning and then once you feel you've gotten to that point then you can start putting commentary is that what I heard you say yeah exactly and sometimes it's you have immediate uh lee uh a reaction to to attacks and feel okay you got it you you know what what that argument is about and and sometimes it takes longer um okay and then um a couple other new Concepts and we'll raise the Pascal on uh the uh or pulling for in just a minute but the uh polish print the couple other words you brought up so there's this distinction of a literary literature note versus a commentary note and then you talked about framing an argument and then you talked about summarizing the perspective of an argument can you can you drill down on that a little bit more because I never really thought of that distinction of a literature note before right well um lumen collected his literature nailed separately to the rest of his permanent melts and permanent notes is a term I used um settled custom notes and um so the literature notes are in his analog uh subtle custom just um the reference on one side and then on the other side on page something it says this and Page seven it says something else and from what I understood is that she spent the day at University rather reading and taking literature notes and in the evening when he was at home where he had his um growth and his actual subtle casting he went through it and thought about okay how's this relevant for what I've written in my settle custom somewhere and um so this is the the important process um the the permanent notes of lumen are very close to his own development of thinking so um you have note sequences which you almost find um verbatim in manuscripts um with um while the literature notes um well maybe you have to distinguish he had basically um two areas of settle casting his first set of cousin was much closer to traditional uh note-taking system because the literature notes were more extensive they are more like excerpts and the emphasis was more on the literature he was reading and after a theoretical break he started with the second and last settled custom which was different in regard to the emphasis on his own thinking so here you have a much bigger disconnect between the literature notes which didn't seem that important anymore to really note sequences um where he developed his own thinking and what I find interesting um in teaching uh Sarah cousin is that it is a system that kind of forces you to make up your mind about what you're reading and what you're thinking you can't just collect stuff because in the moment you look for connections and not just tag stuff or points to in another note but to express the connection between two notes in a full sentence this is where the thinking uh happens and um this is what feels unfamiliar for many people because um this is not the way it's being taught in school and University um usually to develop your own thoughts uh follow your own questions uh instead of giving the best account about what someone else has written um so I like about the system that it's a constant reminder to to make up your mind and to specify what you what you're thinking and if you think two notes um belong together um the subtle cast and kind of asks me um well in what way uh is it is it the same uh just same idea just put differently is it a contradiction is it an extension of an idea um and this is what I find interesting about working with that settled person that I constantly feel um it's not letting me get away with how thoughts Half Baked ideas about it's somehow the same um I I know that looking into Old notes I need to have specified and explicitly put the relationship between two ideas and most often it's a difference it's not the same it seems similar uh to authors using the same words but it's actually different and then I and write something about in one way that's different and this is what I found um very useful and for you and for you and then we'll get to our questions in just a minute for you the um it's less about the tool but more about the thinking so when you're saying zettel costume you're not referring to a particular tool you're thinking about a methodology whatever tool that one may have correct yeah yeah I think that's I think that's a a critically important Point okay uh Pascal you've been hands up and up for a long time hello there oh thank you for giving me the chance to speak and yes hi zonkey I really love your book really enjoyed it so oh yes my name is Pascal so I work in transfusion medicine in the UK uh so I do all of uh research and transfusion but also I use I've used various programs in my life I I've used um uh zotero Devon think and oxygen to keep notes uh and and again they've been fantastic but uh recently I've got myself into uh Tinderbox and uh on I've managed to find myself a few templates of how to implement zettel custom Into The Tinderbox system which is a fantastic way of keeping my records now what was difficult for me before using options is trying to link them together uh with having a sort of display name so it was um we had to put various uh uh I want to put this we we've tinned a box you can have um you can make it your own way so my latest updated Tinderbox or zettel custom if you will I have a lot of my notes in on in um in one of the folders we'll call them and it's linked up to so many notes uh and I find my what what's been very but it's been much better for me is to be able to find My Notes within zazetto castan uh because there's a lot a lot of notes that I put in there but it's about finding where you will pick them up and which one you want to include into my notes now what are the things we've uh Tinder Box but I've found as well was um because I used in the Box for various thing called projects for for my research uh but also for doing investigation at the hospital for example uh and um obviously I can't put them into one file of Tinderbox I have separate tint of Tinderbox files and so um the difference I think with Lumen he was always coming back home where we've won particular settle cast and looking through his notes and trying to make sense of what he's picked up throughout the day and to link them within his little cast and but for me um I I it's about one finding the time to go into myself in an evening and try to pick up the things that I've read and try to link them together so that's kind kind of my I find quite difficult his time but also um to actually go back into mazdatocaster every day to find the right length um I'd also to remember which node it's linked up to basically you had to read all the notes and I find The Tinderbox you're able to use something called display expression where they will you be able to look um at uh the note itself and it will give you an idea where you want to put it whereas with oxygen you almost have to maybe I'm not using it correctly but you almost had to read for a lot of your notes with the date and and to find which note it will be you'll be able to link it up together so that's my observation thank you oxygen or oxygen a number of times I'm not hearing it properly can you put a link to the obsidian obsidian yeah can you put that in the uh the link to the app so so obsidian reaction you Pascal I I um I need to look that up and how halting the Box uh um solves that problem I I do think that digitally you have the opportunity to have different areas of your subtle cast and which are structured differently so the pen and paper um works well with Note sequences where you extend ideas and put a thought to another thought plus you have the hyperlinks but the main characteristic is really these uh this kind of note sequences and um whenever I uh speak with people from your profession um the same uh problem arises and that is that he first of all you deal with a lot of new information that's constantly coming up and secondly you have to quickly um find what you need in a particular situation and I don't think there is a good solution at the moment from what I gather for uh in in the whole area of medicine but I think the digital Solutions be it obsidian and obviously Tinderbox SCA described it have the ability well you you can have a very hierarchical and structured area and at the same time uh parts of this structure can also be parts of a more Loosely structured cytical note sequence area so um I I have areas in my total custom which are highly structured this is more where I collect methods or questions when I do coaching or counseling because I want them at hand it's sometimes also the case that I think about them as part of an ongoing process is the right method um what are new findings about the efficiency of this method so I can link to them from other areas whereas more about research but I want to have this structured if if you deal with someone with anxiety you want to know uh what questions make sense and what are good reminders for yourself and I I can only assume it's similar um in in your field um probably more complex um but it's good to have the opportunity um instead of trying to use a research tool like lumen subtlecastle for um another kind of um information which is um yeah must be treated differently I guess I hope that makes sense too yes thank you and I'm a test you've been incredibly patient you're up but yeah so I was admitted yeah thank you um so I I'm a scientist and I work in the like chemistry and physics mostly also in the laboratory and there was the the the one Connecting Point which Professor Aaron said about the people working in the laboratory that and very often you know when you when you have a boiling acid in one hand and you need to write some observation you need to be very brief and you need to quickly note something which you will also be able to understand your observation and also often your students or other people also need to understand so there's this connection uh where we have to quickly form up formulate the the observation the problem and as briefly as possible and yeah this is something which really helped me also from your book and um jumping to my next comment about the question of Professor of Professor Friedland I also had the problem with the with the dance text reading the dance text and again Professor Aarons came to the rescue here because one one of the sentences which really resonated with me was that if you if you read something and you don't take the the nodes or the proper notes it's like you basically waste your time like if if you don't if you don't um put it into your own words which will force you to like we will check you check if you understand the problem and then we'll force you to briefly and relatively precisely formulate the problem and write it down then uh yeah you at some point you will just lose the time and what what helped me with those kind of things is I I needed to be to put some discipline on myself and really ask the questions all the time which parts are useful for me and when something is new everything seems to be useful but if you really focus on the things which which are useful at the moment and then you maybe put some comment that more on this or more on that subject you can find in this in this literature then you can you can go back to to it afterwards after you you forget maybe so what helped me in in short was to put in this discipline and really like I should focus on this I'm reading this book because I I try to learn about this specific problem or project thank you fantastic thank you for that yeah any uh any comment lucky or you may want to move on if your reaction the only comment is I'm um I'm always fascinated with laboratory notes um because um it's such a special genre of writing um so um there's great research from the development of laboratory notes how pacts um slowly become visible and have first informal names um yeah but but that's more a footnote uh comment hopefully hopefully you took away from that too how much you've impacted people and you're loved I mean everyone to a person said I've read your book and you've changed me so that's that's pretty cool um uh Joan you wanna jump in sure I have a question um hi we read your book in a book club of Rome research a couple of years ago along with how to read a book and you were foundational in setting up my way of processing information going forward um I had come to a point where I had read hundreds and hundreds of books and treaties and articles and it's turned the corner on productivity and understanding and information processing um I continue to use Rome research I do quantitative research but I use that information so I have that piece in the background but I use that information to inform creative teams on messaging so I take one part of my brain and then I put it into visualization so that creative people can then create advertising and messaging from it so I sort of straddle both and what I've noticed and working with Rome research is that I now see my brain patterns much more clearly it's literally when I work in it I can see my brain functioning and other people that I've spoken to since I become part of this PKM world is that people understand how their brains work much better and it really engages them and they feel like they're doing better thinking better writing better insights and I wanted to hear from you if one you've been part of that conversation or have heard those comments um and what your response to that it's an intuitive place to to land but I was wondering what if you had comments and insights on that um I I heard before that um it's the way um if you manage to come up with a system that works for you because I I still think um that um the subtle custom method is not a method you can just apply as a tool and then it works with magic you have to understand um the principles of it and then translate it into your own workflow and adapt it to your own needs just like you described it um how you did it for yourself and I think this adoption process um seemed to um force people to become more aware of their own thinking patterns and what they need from a note taking system and um then come up with with a structure that works for them so I think what you described is very much this translation process and when it works it's because you translated it um by being aware of your research needs and how note taking place into that and the title custom is probably just like a legal set of a few principles a few ideas and then you take the legal and build something your own but while you're building it consciously instead of just using a tool that is available or was taught in school um I very much can relate to what you described that it makes you more aware of um how you're thinking process works how it's structured and by being more aware of it you gain influence of it you can make decisions um oh maybe it's better I do this maybe um it's um better to be explicit about the relationships because I get the feedback when I come back to my notes and there is no uh description of the relationship there's just a link to another note I I'm getting frustrated so from now on uh I'm doing my future self a favor and doing what I um learned works best as a user so um it's probably the integrated feedback loop that allows you to to improve on on the thinking and note-taking and how it's interlocked so um yeah I can relate to what you said and it's something I I heard before interestingly with different kinds of setups and different kinds of tools um some was wrong some with obsidian um and now obviously and Tinderbox as well thank you you know that makes me think of another concept we often discuss in the in the community is this idea of incremental formalization and I and I believe that's kind of what you just said in that yo you'll take a note and then along the way you'll realize wait a minute I I didn't add something in what I should have or and then at that moment you can go ahead and add it and then what you realize is if you find yourself adding that kind of thing back multiple times then you'll realize then at the very beginning you'll learn at least that's what I've taught myself is that once I've been like found that I needed to be adding that thing two or three times then from the very beginning I start adding it immediately because of you know being kind to my future self I know my future self is going to want it whereas before I used to collect everything and then that was inefficient so then I collected what I was thinking I needed to know and I've learned the incremental formalization will then help me improve along the way uh does that make sense or totally and I'm going to steal that expression because I like it awesome all right uh uh you had a follow-up question then we'll go to Kim if I wouldn't ask this question Professor Evans I'm on the like younger side of the receiving I guess audience of your book and what the first thing which really resonates with me was your um let's say anarch anarchistic approach to the current you know manuals of research writing and all those things and I was wondering did you have any like negative response from the maybe the authors of the of those kind of books or maybe your professor colleagues at your University or something that well basically you yeah disapprove a lot of very um established theories about how one or students should learn um what first of all I'm the the professor title was already borrowed I'm not at the University currently um I'm freelancing um but well well the funny thing is um even though I worked in philosophy of education pedagogy and where you would think questions like uh writing note-taking learning um introductions into academic work should play a big role it's not really discussed um among my colleagues um it's it's it's a bit of a curiosity that I've written a book on note-taking but it's not discussed within the field there it's about more theoretical development philosophy education and it's it's almost like you have written a novel um it's something you mentioned uh in the coffee break but it's not really discussed and I haven't spoken with um um [Music] colleagues who follow a more systematic less anarchistic approach to note taking to use your words um but I often feel many of these introductory books um uh written not from a theoretical standpoint but more from an idea of how they think uh writing and note-taking works but it doesn't really it's a little bit like um when you speak with scientists and then hear what they say they do and then they when you look what they actually do it's often quite different um these um approaches where you go through these seven steps of reading understanding asking questions I don't know if anyone actually ever approached a text like this um looking at the title first and then deciding do I read it do I read it not um uh it's sometimes it it's a little bit like fantasy literature um yeah but I I haven't really had brutal discussions about that and and I like the idea that you put something out there and people can resonate with it and use it to their advantage we could as they needed and um if it doesn't work then here was another approach and um it's certainly not the only approach that works and it's probably works for a particular kind of um personality or interest even though some some things I would defend as universal like he should choose your system in a way that it counteracts to confirmation boys and not set your own writing up in a way that um increases your confirmation bias and I think technology can help with that a lot hey thank you hey uh Kim you're up yeah I had a question about how to set up the uh the actual case in terms of the index environment in terms of the you have your flea notes your literature notes purple notes and they're you're trying to set up relationships as sort of a daily management concept but you're trying how do you actually set up the index itself and I can never go I never got I read your books uh phenomenal uh books and thank you uh pretty much to meet with you today but what is how do you index it I mean I know we got links you can link things together but how do you set up the index thank you right um well Lumen himself had a typed on a typewriter typed index just alphabetically assorted um pointing not to every note that is related to a certain concept but more like I would call them but that's my um terminology entry notes so like when you point to a certain note you know okay that's a good way into the topic and sometimes it's what someone like Nick Milo might call maps of content so in Lumen settle custom you also I have this um concept notes um which points you in different directions so if you look up systems theory you might see specified links to um social systems um mechanical systems family systems Etc so that from the index you get from systems theory a link to this map of content where then you're distributed to different areas but that index is mapped out right you just you have to have the index abbreviated some way uh to tied it into maybe uh your link does that make sense well lumos was alphabetically sorted so what do you have in the digital version is of course um it Greater uh ability to um give yourself an overview um first of all you have the full text search so you know that you don't have to bother too much with indexing but whenever um you encounter a problem with complexity um when you search for something and two too many um uh results come up then it's often a good idea uh to write yourself something like an entry note um where you categorize um like Newman did on this maps of content cards so um it's a top down and bottom up approach in a way so whenever I feel it's getting too complex so I give myself an overview um I do have an alphabetic index but that's just that when I have a concept usually one word titles um that I give it an index tag so in the index it would just appear as an alphabetical list but um I also have an overview um like a dashboard or a starting page where I put more descriptive uh or notes with more descriptive titles which work like entry notes into a particular topic so it's not so much like in the index card where I point to different ways of speaking about systems or different ways of discussing ideology but from the starting page I point to my discussion of the problem with ideology in systems theory because I know okay that that's a topic um I have a lot of notes on and when I start with that note um I can go from there and it's top down and bottom up because whenever I feel okay there is a cluster building um I'm on um to add to that and um deliberately think about that so it's um it's getting onto the starting page but also especially in the beginning when you start with a set of cousin as you don't start from scratch it kind of makes sense to begin with a kind of brain down write down okay what are the questions I'm already thinking about and um use these um starting uh notes as a kind of backbone um so you have something to add to later um so the starting page will be mocs are also the plays within the subtle cast where you can deliberately think about is this something I actually want to work on I want to keep working on um or is it something that um it's it's not that much of an interest to me um so that that's a way of giving yourself an overview um yeah so index more alphabetic index pointing to one word titles and more topic um overview pointing more to notes with descriptive titles where you know okay there's a particular question being discussed thank you Doctor awesome thank you for insights and when you refer to Nick Milo it was Nick m-i-l-o and this idea of mapping of content is that what you're referring to yeah um I mean he stresses the idea of maps of content so I feel obliged to uh mention this name um uh um and I think it makes sense to to have this loose structure um that whenever you have too many notes within a cluster you give yourself an overview over that cluster on a new note and point to that note as the entry note um it makes sense yeah no no totally we just I've not heard that term before or that person before yeah we're adding them to the index of learning so that's awesome yeah good gotcha um anybody else have another comment thought questions about how we evolve this if not let's pop over to the uh while you're waiting for that so Fidel it wasn't actually Dominique Dominique had question two but Fidel had a comment last week that said um how does one avoid overwhelm you know after a while the slip box becomes massive for me uh how does one uh you know catalyze revision so that's some comments that Fidel gave us uh in the Forum can you respond to those two questions um it's a problem um and I treat it as part of the process um so what I described with um giving yourself an overview um that's often triggered by the feeling of being unoverwhelmed with something I have too many notes um I'm not sure where should I go I take that as a feedback that I should give myself overview over a note so um it's this system Theory idea of complexity builds app um just by itself that's the nature of things and then you have to invent something that reduces the complexity again and after having reduced the complexity uh now you can build up because you have more capacity for it generally um there is sometimes a different kind of overwhelm occurring and that is when people feel obliged to follow all Loose Ends um like like a zero inbox idea and that is impossible um when you yeah when you have uh something like a set of person where almost every note could be expanded on commented on and this is I think lesser technical um problem and more a question of the mindset uh you approach um this problem and um my solution to that is that those ideas and questions I find extremely important and I don't want to lose sight of um they will have the place on my starting page dashboard or one of the mocs everything else is um approached by Me was a kind of abundancy mindset that I don't feel I need to respond to every question in my subtle question I don't need to follow up all those ends on the contrary it's great to have more possibilities to follow up on than I have time to actually do so I I try to turn it around and think about it as well thankfully um I have a title cousin full of possibilities to continue working on um and when I add an idea um I don't have to follow it to the end I can just write down well interesting article from Michael Becker about dinner Brock's um in a way if I um in the future discuss that question look that up I don't have to look it up now um but it's noted I can pick up the thread in the future but I don't have to um so I I don't have a to-do list uh idea about my notes you leave yourself a breadcrumb if you will um exactly yeah and that goes back to the point I think that was being said later in that if you don't leave yourself that breadcrumb you're wasting time because you're eventually gonna have to find it again so if you give yourself that breadcrumb in the moment you can you can save yourself a ton of time from having to backtrack yeah okay um all right and then any other comments thoughts Mr Bernstein what how are you how are you how is this molding over for you you're on mute by the way there oh I'm just taking lots of notes yeah yeah me too it's really good um all right any other thoughts who else has some other Concepts like maybe um yeah Ian you've been you've been quiet as of many of you and Dave Rogers you you and art you tend to have ample comments maybe you guys can chime in and give us some of your reactions I'm enjoying this I don't um I read a lot I I feel as though I don't do myself a service by taking good notes I do a lot of highlighting and uh I probably should go back and and organize those somehow but I'm I'm happy to listen in and uh and get inspired I'm seeing a lot of good comments in the uh in the chat so well and I but I think that I think I think you just raised a really important point that we need to go back to and Professor earns is already mentioned this several times but there's this idea of that initial and we talked about this with um Sasha last week as well there or a couple weeks ago now there's that initial note that you take which is like that raw note that's undefined and if you're if you've done yourself a service you'll have cited it immediately where did it come from but it's still super raw and then there's that next step that he I think you called it a prominent note or a permanent note Dr Ernst that that that then starts getting curated it starts becoming is put into your own words it's refined it's it very well maybe its own Atomic note being there but it then also May link itself back up to one of these cons um concept notes or entry notes as as you as you said and that's that curation process and I think what a lot of people want to do is they want to jump from that initial collection all the way to Creation but there's some steps in between that need to be gone through to be able to really you know to the incremental formalization Concepts that we were talking about earlier that are critically important it cannot be skipped now do you agree with that or what's your reaction to that kind of observation of uh of how we go about because Dave Rogers and called himself out on it he's like I take notes but then I never really go back and it sounds like that Going Back part is where knowledge and thinking is happening yeah well in defense uh to highlighting even though I I know I um I was very kind to highlighting in the book but um I I sometimes feel it's a necessary in between step um that goes back to what I said in the beginning it really depends on the kind of um text you're reading um sometimes you need that in between step of highlighting first and then going through it a second time because only when you have read the whole thing you know um how certain arguments make sense or not and then you have the highlights and that's a good indication to jump back in and then take notes from there um but it's an in-between step it's not uh the alternative to write something about it in your own words so if you can skip the highlighting um uh step um great because then you can uh come as quickly as possible to where the actual thinking is happening and that is asking all the questions about how is this information relevant for what I have already written down somewhere else which after a while becomes equivalent to um things I'm thinking about um instead of thinking about what I'm thinking about you can just look into your setup custom because what you're thinking about is somewhere there and if it's not there you probably have not thought about it yet um so yeah I I just agree that um you have to immerse yourself in this step which sometimes feels a bit like it's slowing you down but I believe that's where new ideas are generated um spending some time with the questions of how is it related what's the importance of it um is there a counter argument Etc and being explicit about that writing it down brings your work forward yeah awesome art you haven't spoken yet oh yeah hi thanks for doing this Sirens um I have a question relating to the ingestion of ideas and and so you know I notice you've been holding a pen for a period during this uh this Meetup and you know my question is like we're Gathering thoughts and we're coming up with ideas ever more rapidly and uh they're coming in at perhaps opportunity in opportune times you may be near your computer you may be in inputting something into your mobile phone there are pen and paper and and and the old analog system has its own beautiful advantages and then of course there's a then the challenge of translating some of that into a into a computer system you know which sort of then ultimately contributes to your knowledge base my question is uh how do you manage um you mean what kind of tools I actually use not necessarily the tools because I I believe like the tools again you know can be found um to suit your requirements and everybody thinks differently but just in terms of your your ideological attitude towards um um okay now I'm taking this note how am I going to deal with it how am I ultimately going to get it into my uh what's the path your mind follows right um well I have a lot of different kinds of inboxes so to speak um so um when I'm on a walk um I um use my phone to take um audio notes and um I'm not very disciplined and going through them on the same day which would probably make sense um but they are they are there once in a while I go through them and check half of them because it's just one of these ideas that sounded good to me in in the moment uh but not an hour later um at play as well like okay it's an idea that comes from abundance you're on a walk 20 ideas yeah don't necessarily have to act exactly if it's really an idea I feel okay that that's a breakthrough then I set myself a reminder on my calendar um so it pops up um but if it's just on the list of audio notes um I go through it when it's convenient the same is with um having a paper notebook with me all the time I used that less for um touching ideas and more to elaborate on vague ideas I like scribbling around and drawing lines and write down what I don't want to forget often trivial things I just like the whole physical appeal of paper notebook um it's a way of being more peaceful um in my mind it's like um my thoughts are grounded in a way and if I don't know if that metaphor makes any sense to you but I feel if I just rely on my head alone they tend to spin around and the moment I have a pen in my hand and a paper in front of me um it's um yeah it it grounds them somehow um like even if you're doodling you're creating sort of the bounds and the structure of what you're up to yeah yeah for sure yeah and then I at the moment uh I I use a remarkable uh in e-paper uh notebook um but that's very specific because it's not really integrated into any other system it's just when I have meetings with people um I uh I think I might meet again or I like to meet again but I have just a collection of meeting notes um at hand and I wouldn't want to type while we are talking I think it's impolite um especially when my microphone is on um and it's also a bit random because sometimes it's just words and or things I want to look up someone had an idea I want to look up um so meeting notes um have their special place and um it's also a bit of journaling that it's more private that I feel I wanna um use um a proper handwriting tool with even though it's an eve uh tool but it it works in the same way I suspect going back to the brain though too there might be something with that physical connection behind your brain I mean I don't I don't know this but maybe moving your hand actually does something in the brain and laying down the pathways of the information well there are two things that I I noticed um first of all that's well known it slows you down and it's slowing down your own thoughts it's very helpful um but secondly um editing is so much more of a hassle and when I type I'm constantly rewriting a sentence when I write by hand I wouldn't constantly cross out what I've written um so I'm a little bit more deliberate and a little bit more forgiving with imperfect sentences so it's more likely that I fill a page when I have a pen in my hand just because there's a little bit of a higher threshold to editing um and I find that for rough drafts or for preparations for talks um extremely helpful because in the end you have a page full of ideas and I think twice about doing that again um so it's a kind of psychological trick on myself I guess so is there a log Jam and you're getting all of this into your final into your settle custom is there a point at which there there's a bit of a choke okay what's going to go in now how much time I'm going to devote to just grooming and and maintaining my my database how much time and how am I going to take these different sources analog a digital and from my voice recording um when there isn't like if I encounter an idea I find really valuable I make myself an out to to put them in subtle custom or go directly to it um okay but it's I I don't have such a um perfect routine with a dedicated time during the day where I go through it it's more I sometimes feel not um focused enough to continue working on a manuscript or uh and then it's it still works going through my notes and thinking about okay how can I combine it with what I've already written it's it's more like a um concentration question or um what kind of mood I am or what phase in a project I am so sometimes I'm working on a manuscript and I wouldn't touch my setup custom for days because now it's getting about okay it's it's about reviewing and going through the reviews and things like that and sometimes it's reading a book and I don't want to be distracted but for sure getting into the ideas of someone else um real quick though in that and I think there's a tendency that we've had in The Tinderbox Community where is you know is Tinderbox a settle constant or not is is is is it this kind of tool or not and you mentioned like sometimes I'll go days without touching my zettle costume as if it was you know and in your context and your implementation is as if it's something different and I think what's important for The Tinderbox Community for like for myself if you go to the extreme Tinderbox is both my subtle costume but it's also my writing environment it's also my publishing environment it's also so there's way and going back to Kim's point on indexing you know there's ways to set up your Tinderbox file so on you know off to the side is your Atomic notes your permanent notes your your the things you haven't curated and then over here is your writing and the template you're applying to it and your ability so I've used Tinderbox to publish literally 500 page reports right and those 500 page reports are then back to their permanent notes and then often their semi-un permanent notes so there's this this extreme of from The Collection stage to your contribution AKA your output and then we all invariably will use different tools at different times to help us get there yeah and and we were just talking about this last week where someone was says well is Tinder boxes that will cost it or not and the answer is yes or no it just depends on how you're choosing to use it any other tool so I just wanted to interject that comment or statement makes sense um uh all right anything else before we move on oh no no thanks so much for your answer I really appreciate it um you've been up for longer than Pascal so you jump back in yeah I I really like this idea of the multiple inboxes uh I was just going to say that like when I was in the meeting like face-to-face meetings like people really take it um well in a bad way when you start typing on your phone right or even laptop like so this is where I usually borrow the the iPad from my wife and I I write something with it with the pen because I like the digital uh the digital advantage of search later on and this is really like I think closely related to David's Islands right getting things done like you really have this peace of mind right when you um first of all when you write down what's what's on your what's on your mind or dictate like when you said you you when you are on a walk but the the second thing is I think the peace of mind is only uh like real when you know that you will come back to it like David Allens has this review um of all the notes uh idea which very closely relates to the Central Casting um processing of the fleeting notes right I think and and this connects more to the to the highlights which I think we could fix the problem of highlights if we treated them like fleeting notes so if we go back to them and process them then I think there is nothing wrong with the with the with the highlights I think the danger is that we often don't go back like in time when we are still when we still know why did we even highlighted this and then then this may become a problem yeah and you you miss this you missed this last week but on that very Point that's where uh Sasha had said even on those fleeting notes grab context right the second you create a fleeting note well why did you take that leave yourself that little context clue so that you will help you to be able to Circle back when you want to when you want to evolve it and I think that's really an important point you just made yeah but you know you you always think like I will know right I I I'm just highlighting it but yeah of course there's this this is the danger yeah I think yeah yeah especially if you're super busy you may forget within 20 minutes I mean you just got a lot going on your head and you're certainly forget in a couple of weeks uh um anything else no thank you awesome thanks uh Pascal oh thank you I think Massey is kind of pretty better than I was going to put it here um so I used to highlight as well in a lot of my books and I ended up reading the books again because um I couldn't remember what I highlighted these things but now I definitely just write everything so I use Devin think to kind of write my little notes I use my the iron insertion excuse me to write a little note and uh so then it shows into my inbox and when I get to my computer in the evening then I know I need to process and try to find this and add this to my Zephyr Castle in uh my Tinderbox um yeah and I use these as you said the fleeting knows pretty much what you said about the uh the inbox will be uh the first units would be in my inbox rather if I'm using a highlighted bit but yeah I agree with you awesome all right any other comments points reactions deadlift you've been super quiet we haven't heard from you in a while what's what's your uh which how are you reacting to this oh thanks for asking me directly I'm just listening and uh I'm uh there are so many um good Inspirations for me um I'm still working on my settled customer redesigning it whenever I have time I have a little bit to a high workload at the moment but um for me my the problem is linking uh of the notes um because for me a node is always um something more or less static and um I don't know my my thinking is uh evolving my thinking is changing over time but my nodes are aesthetic and that's my main problem with my digital title castle that I would like to uh the links is what solves my problem I I think but um I'm still not not very not too satisfied with how I'm doing it at the moment to get a more Dynamic approach to um to reorganizing uh the the the thinking um or no the the the knowledge that is in my notes and um I do like Tinderbox um for this approach because uh with the agents um dinner box is a very powerful tool to rearrange your notes and to um to later on have an idea and then to collect all the nodes that fit to this idea and that is that's what I'm trying to solve but I'm I'm still working on it and that look just to jump in on that real quick let me show you this and I think this really helps just for those people that are looking at this too so for those that are not familiar with Tinderbox this is a Tinderbox file let me go find you all again and you know here's a great example of I got a quote um let me go find that example here so if I go down here so you see I was I was interacting with a buddy of mine called Dixon uh his name's Dixon he works for Fujitsu and you know there's a lot going on here so you'll notice I went ahead and in this field where I say person I add in Dixon's name and I've got action code behind the scenes that automatically creates a note for me if it doesn't already exist called Dixon so this way I can go ahead and insert you know the permanent note that is the curated person that is Dixon here in this note and I got this quote for him for this event that we're going to be doing I then was able to take this and now this so I've got now two permanent notes I've got a note called Dixon and I now have a quote from Dixon on this particular day that's also using hook sort of searched to his permanent permission and consent that he's given me for using this quote I then can roll up and I've got another note I then call Post which is now another permanent note which is related to um the comment that I'm going to be making about the quote that Dixon did you know Dixon's great it's really interesting all that and then there's the picture of the of the quote that we've made but what's interesting there in terms of linking I now have another attribute called term very similar to person and there anything I'm writing in here will be automatically generating a term if it doesn't already exist and then linking to that term at which point then I could go in then Define those terms and so this process is now letting me create even more persistent notes and all of that is happening automatically and then I can then go back and incrementally evolve it and and handle that over time and then then one letter better one last kind of thing and showing this demonstration is that's like the input and curation methods and then it's the creation for me comes from then I'm reading that that Dixon's quote and I can start writing about what that means to me so that's now making it a commenting approach and then going to the method of publishing if you're then going to social media yo using hashtags and mention tags are critical in social media to drive attraction so leveraging Tinderbox templates I'm then able to then have Tinderbox automatically using action code create the hashtag and mention Cloud for me so then when I turn around and post this into LinkedIn for instance that happens all automatically as well so this kind of gives you an example for those that might be listening how you could a great example of using Tinderbox to collect some notes in the process of curation have that process create more notes even for you and then allow you to facilitate using the templating function to actually have immediate output um and that if you're if you're interested in that we can talk about that later uh happy to share how I'm doing that um yeah Pascal and uh Mateus you raise your hands real quick yeah sorry just very quickly to add to this I think the the danger around having a digital version um with this is I think with Lumen he was constantly looking at where this specie collection connection was happening whether this where would this fit in whereas if you have something quite automatic that you just put it under uh digitally will just link up to that note would you then go back to read the original knowledge before to eventually whether it's linking up to the to the new node so I think this is um an area we might need to look into at how to make sure that we go back and read the original note if that makes sense it totally does and by the way it just shined up uh you're in the in the um and the chat just brought up a really important point he says my zetel cost and my writing my environment my publishing environment this is also a risk for those who use emacs personally I find it helpful to switch between tools uh your I absolutely agree with you so what I tend to find is when I actually start to go try to publish the stuff I've written in xender in Tinderbox going into the new environment like LinkedIn or like word or like PowerPoint you know and Marshall mcluhan taught us this in 1964 the medium's the message as I'm going out of the medium that is Tinderbox and I start to use that message that stuff that I think is just so brilliant and I start putting it into the LinkedIn environment I realize well wait a minute this content's not really working in this particular environment so at that point of publishing in that new tool all I will invariably will be making changes and I and that absolutely happens as I go to word PowerPoint or any other Medium as well so I think there it's it's not all one tool all of these other tools do again macclennan had it right the medium is the message the medium you have used will influence your message your message will influence the medium so I think that's another good learning from from this all right we've got we're just starting to run over but we had another a couple other questions somebody else raised their hand but then dropped it who was it do I think it was Oliver yeah Oliver go for it yeah thank you very much uh Michael um I was a little bit dropping out so I don't know exactly the way of the discussion that was going but um uh to the point that sometimes the two are extension of our personal environments and brains everyone has its own tool and what you just showed Michael is the way you design your external brain and for someone else someone else it doesn't mean a thing right so it's it's the way it's it's tailored to your thinking and somehow Tinderbox allows you to create this kind of management environment to have this information flowing through you and that's what Nicholas Lumen when I turned to the beginning of the discussion also was saying that his settle cost is his communication partner right he's uh requesting things from him and so on and um I personally am still looking for my external brain I'm I'm working with Tinderbox on and off and I'm using it since I think 30 years when storybook came by I I was a storybook user first and I never came down to the one tool and I regret this I I'm always looking for uh for the best way and maybe I'm the one type that never can settle with one Tool uh because I'm constantly when I said it was one tool I constantly look at the features of another tool saying ah maybe you make it one decision uh let's go somewhere else and maybe What circus is telling us it's up to two it's uh it's the way you think and that needs to settle uh how do you deconstruct what you find reconstruct what you think and then construct for the environment where you publish and talk to right this is the deconstruct reconstruct construct segment and everyone has his own uh way of doing it so and then sometimes the two comes by and helps you a little bit like a protasis or something yeah it gives you a little kick and and and and speed you up in a sense but um what I'm learning from the discussions and the meetups that you do is what all kind of different ways people try to go down to solve this problem for themselves so I'm Amazed by all this creativity that you all have and trying to solve this everyone has the same problem yeah but everyone has an own way of solving it sometimes somehow Zoom could try to suggest one way but I'm not sure if if that's has he ever got the impression that people just take on his suggestions or do they just change those suggestions for the personal uh knowledge work I don't know maybe Mr orange could answer this go for it thank you uh stanky you're on mute sorry uh it resonates with something Joanne said earlier about uh the or how she described to tweak the tool to her own needs and um I think you're absolutely right that's that that that's how it works and it comes with the effect of probably being more aware of our thinking and how we structure it and um being more aware of the pros and cons of different tools um which probably wasn't that much of a discussion when there weren't so many different uh variations available but but I think you're absolutely right and that so we need go ahead so it's it's like it forces you to think about thinking right and and and design the design and so on it's a meta role yeah yeah the tools are kind of part of the metacognitive skills um that um that are interesting in themselves and maybe people who are drawn to trying out different things uh are also motivated by trying out how it affects the thinking so so it's maybe more than just The Shining you uh object problem it's maybe a curiosity about um thinking of Thanos and um it's a good thing isn't it so we are running a little late but we have two questions left and I want to make one comment just talking about now I'll start with the comment first I was talking to somebody out the other day and they're like well what's you know you know what's the best email client she asked me and I'm like well the reality is I actually use four email clients and I have one that I primarily use for my every of my everyday email emailing because I I prefer its UI I prefer some of the capability it gives me but when it comes down to Mac Mail I use the Mac Mail as well because it allows me to use hook and other things that the other client doesn't allow me to use and then when I need to perform search I use mailmate because mailmate is a markdown functionality and a better search function than any of the other ones all combined so you know just like a um you know when a construction person goes to a job they very well may have three or four different kinds of hammers they're all called the category of hammer but you know each of the different you know there's a rubber Hammer there's a larger Mallet you know sometimes the category of hammer you need two or three to be able to address your need in a particular job so getting hung up on one tool I think is dangerous uh frankly um but at the same time going overboard and having too many tools can also become problematic too you got to find that balance for yourself that's my comment uh two last questions um Fidel foreign thanks so much for this conversation it's been really useful I came a little bit late so I don't know if this has been handled and I had started reading uh smart notes I do confess that I did not finish reading the book uh this was maybe two three years ago my question is to uh is is so I'm just thinking uh what you said what you said about longhand really resonated powerfully with me and the reason it did was because I found that writing longhand is the thing which enabled me to finally finish writing a manuscript of a novel like just doing it digitally couldn't hack I couldn't do it and when I when I went long hand I finished it so what you said really resonated and my question to you is with zettel Casten and um let's say I've got some index cards I've got a physical index I've got physical index cards and um of my literature notes and my fleeting notes Etc and I'm trying now to like bring them together and construct meaning could you just talk me through what that process could look like with some physical cards like I know it's probably like look at this one look at that one put this together put that together but from your experience like I don't know if you just give like a snapshot overview of some of the steps what that would look like if it's possible first of all congratulations on finishing a manuscript that's always a big thing isn't it yes thank you and um so you're using an analog paper pen and paper based type of custom yes yes um have you come using a digital index in addition to the paper type of cousin because um I think it can work well together that you have the advantages of writing longhand um have the physical advantages of having the paper arranged and so on but the index um might work better in um just having a digital alphabetical list pointing to paper um that's how I would approach it if I decided to to go analog I'm not completely because the index can digitally be modified more easily um the alternative would be having smaller cards um alphabetically sorted very much like in a library um and then you can have on the cards also uh like mocs or hubs where you can point to different uh aspects but you have the problem yes these are not fixed notes but developing notes um you kind of have to squeeze in between and um but it worked for Lumen he he typed it and Captain index separately um but as a recommendation on a quick note I I would have a digital list um it can just be in text file um nothing fancy okay all right all right and uh we're gonna we're way over time but Matisse you get the last word what's your final question okay my final question is Dr irons what what stops you from making a Wikipedia type of notes like what would or or I should we call them like what would be your tips for let's say beginner um Advocates of settle custom uh wrong from doing a Wikipedia type of Etc content which means I mean by that that I think everything will be useful I want to put everything I I use I work in in science so I would like all the data everything under my hand but this is just not not possible due to time constraints what what would be something you you could say about that to help work the distinction is really important I I believe so I think it's an important question and to me it it helps um to keep in mind well if I just want to have information that's what the internet is for what actual Wikipedia is for because I can always look it up but when it comes to writing uh settled from a settled person I'm in a dialogue with um a communication partner and like with an actual uh partner I'm very familiar with I'm spending a life with um we don't have to tell each other everything all the time again and again we kind of know stuff so we can leave much bigger gaps than when we had to speak with someone else so I only write down what I assume I would forget otherwise I'm writing on the edges on the borders of my understanding so when I write something down then because I'm not yet really um clear about something it's it's a pro process of understanding of going beyond my current understanding it's not about recording what I already know and um so maybe that's a good or helpful metaphor that first of all you speak with someone who knows you very well so no need to explain everything all the time again and again and secondly it's about thinking on the borders of your understanding so if you struggle a bit to find the right words then it's good if it feels like a jaw where you just have to write down what's on your mind then it's probably not worth writing it down in the first place but that would be my answer uh excellent thank you I'm just writing that down I mean that I think that's a really powerful concept because that's where the incremental formalization if you're struggling with that then allow yourself to go through those revisions all right well I personally could could keep you on for gazillion more years this was just awesome uh everyone was given me virtual or real Round of Applause or collapse this was fabulous thank you so much for taking the time I really appreciate it and thank you very much and we'll uh hopefully have you again one of these days and please try and we'll get you on a Mac so we get you to play with Tinderbox and get you part of the community all right well is that everybody thank you very much thank you last bye-bye thank you all right thank you thank you everybody oh I'm Mr Bernstein are you still around foreign",

Michael Becker hey everybody uh welcome to uh this week's Tinderbox May 7th is our Meetup uh and we're really and let me just kind of go through the the 10th um General format the general format is we go around the room and we have new people introduce themselves we've got a ton of those today um we'll then uh we tend to then talk about like what are we doing in this whole area of personal and learning Knowledge Management what tool skills are we using uh to accomplish that we'll then talk about how we're using Tinderbox to help us achieve those goals or any other tools within the community uh within the Frameworks to help us achieve those goals and then we dig into either uh specific problem solving that somebody may have um or will address a theme that we have for that particular event and today we've got a theme and if you don't mind let's skip some of the introductions of new people today because we don't want to waste any time at all uh and we have the uh and I'm gonna asanki arms how do I print I'm terrible at names is that okay I'm terrible with names as well okay and he is the author of how to take smart notes and and I have to tell you I'm I'm like so excited about this because I came across your book when it first came out and it was like raw eye dropping revolutionary for me and there were still some nuggets in there that I carry with me like every morning I wake up I'm like all right this is how to do it and it's been I'm just so grateful for you for having written it and helped me along my path and then I'm just terribly excited I'm kind of a groupie to have you actually be here and be able to share your thoughts and ideas with us so um so thank you uh and so with that in mind zonkey has agreed to join us and and just guide us in a discussion uh along his book uh on um how to take smart notes so um please use the chat please ask him questions let's have a really fertile dialogue and then in the end if we have time we can talk about Tinderbox stuff and all that but I suspect we won't so let's Jump Right In on it's okay you want to introduce yourself and uh help us guide us through the conversation sure um thank you for having me um yeah I'm the author of how to take smart notes um I it was a bit of a procrastination project I was writing on something else but then I felt um I needed to write a little bit about how I write because um the way uh writing is being taught in university is often so diameterally um different to how I worked that I felt I needed to have something for my students that is not misleading and the uh the main problem seemed to me that writing was often taught as an afterthought of thinking and in a very linear way so still people often ask for about my workflow assuming that you started at a certain point you get an idea you get an assignment you agreed to hand in an article then you start from that idea you do your research you do your reading then you write about what you read then you stop thinking about it and in the end you write it down and this also mirrors in a way a shift in philosophy about how we think about the relationship between writing and thinking um that's I was very interested in at the moment on a theoretical basis um so it was a nice opportunity to um still without actually mentioning the philosophy behind it the practicality of um certain um uh discussions which are more on an abstract level and also I was always interested in Nicholas Lumen and his work on uh social systems and System Theory in general so my background is a little bit um uh philosophy of education on the one hand with emphasis on social systems and sociology but in the other hand I'm a trained therapist and coach in systems therapy so um Nicholas Roman was also influential on that side and at the same time the subtle cousin was often more discussed as a curiosity and not really in relationship to the theory in itself and I wasn't always interested in in the relationship between the actual physical work of thinkers and the outcome so there's obviously no linear relationship no cause of a relationship but I don't think Lumen would have been able to um write such a complex Theory to develop such a complex Theory without the sophisticated external um brain where he can um delegate the complexity delegate the memory uh and focus on what the brain is actually very good in and that is making an association uh comparing things and it's so much easier to compare things when you have it in front of you so um yeah there was kind of the reason I was interested in um in writing that book and I think it's resonates with uh um a new development and or a new interest in the external brain or externalizing um ideas uh taking the material side of um um knowledge work more into consideration um but yeah so um I'm now more interested in where you want to pick up on um what questions you have because I assume that yes this is a regular Meetup you have certain lines of discussions and interests that are recurring and gear uh discussed with different people from different perspectives so I'm I'm happy to join in so Dominique I see you're online and in the Forum this week you talked about you know this idea of when you're taking notes how do you distinguish between you know that really rough note and the and the larger note and making them discoverable along the way and that whole process of curating knowledge and but before we bring him up I wanted to kind of comment when I was doing my um my my test for my doctoral uh uh process um I remember reading a book just prior to taking my test and they said writing was thinking and you know in the first what 38 years of my life no one ever bothered to tell me that and I think that the fact that you brought that up maybe you can talk a little bit about that more as well like how this process of writing is actually thinking um as opposed to documenting of simple documentation or what's the distinction for you yeah I mean there's this um wonderful book by any Murphy Paul uh I hope I get her name right um about the extended mind um and that is very much an overview over different research areas and the rediscovery of the importance of the outside of the brain so it makes a difference if you think alone or if you think with peers if you think with a pen in your hand or just staring at the wall or the blank page um I spend a lot of time reading about um history of Natural Sciences and work in the laboratory and there you find um a lot of um informal um ways in which scientists describe their work and they always seem to emphasize how they think with uh their tools and how um the um laboratory is in a way um the um The Horizon which in thinking happens and it would be um strange to reduce um the thinking uh into the brain and so there you find this um informal speech with just always treating the environment as part of the thinking process and at the same time a struggle on a um for philosophers of science to to grasp that concept because it's still very much representational uh with the idea it's about getting the outside insight and um yeah getting away from that clear Cartesian distinction between inside and outside I think discussions like you have can be very much put into this um new rediscovery of um the importance of um the extended mind okay and anybody have any reactions comments to that or thoughts I can chime in with more but um what do you think thoughts ideas like so what like you know it's also called the second brain right so what are your what is what would you recommend as the tools and the techniques for marrying this extended mind with um you know with our own internal self uh would you call it the internal and external and and how does that apply to your note-taking process right um well first of all the metaphors uh something worth discussing um the extended mind is certainly something different than a second brain um and maybe it's semantics but I often think behind the semantics is a certain idea about the relationship between the tools we use and um our own thinking um I don't think there is a um something you can recommend generally to everyone because obviously the tools of someone who's working in the laboratory are very different to the tools you use when you're a social scientist I'm obviously more drawn to lumens approach but when it comes to the question what digital tools do you use to replicate the subtle custom um and to transfer the analog into the digital um that is a more difficult problem than people often seem to realize because um you can't just imitate um the analog in the digital if you try to be as close as possible to the original uh pen and paper version I don't think you come up with the best solution I think coming up with the best solution means using uh the strength of the digital in in the best way possible and having more a loose idea about the analog as an um background idea um and I try not to fall into the Trap of the shiny new toy and um change um constantly between applications but my process was roughly I started with pen and paper I changed the format then in the early days I just had an HTML website where I linked manually in an editor then I had a mix of analog and digital because some things make more sense in digital having lists and indica Etc um and then I used wrong for a while and because I Was preparing an online course um and the requests were overwhelmingly for obsidian um I um looked closely closer at obsidian and um how much trouble it would be to transfer my notes into that make myself familiar enough to to be able to say something intelligent about it and now I kind of um sticking with that and um yeah that's right are you a Mac or a PC user I'm a PC user got it then that's probably why yeah so at some point when you and we won't do it now but if you're interested let's have a side conversation and I'll happily show you the uh The Tinderbox tool and I I think we'll I'll make it my my missionary my missionary objective to convert you into this back world it's pretty it's pretty darn cool but uh well that that's for a later dialogue Mr Lou you got your hands up been up a while yes thank you uh Dr Aarons I really appreciate your work I appreciate your being here with us today I have a very specific question about a kind of note-taking I'm also a social scientist I'm a sociologist I work in German social theory as a matter of fact so very close I've read lumon's work I've used lumon's work I primarily work on Harper Moss but I move back and forth my question is a very specific one when you're reading that kind of dense social theory that requires close reading line by line really even sometimes certainly paragraph by paragraph and you're trying to reconstruct a larger argument I understand the general principle of writing to internalize for yourself writing what this means to you but you're trying to capture a larger argument in the context of the the Zeto costume type program that you're that you're described that you write about how do you how do you do that one very specific kind of problem of reconstructing a dense argument from a series of you know attacks that basically where you can't simply say well I think he's saying this about the public sphere it's a very very specific kind of layered reconstruction what what do you how do you handle that and I by the way I use your book I I've given it to graduate students I've used it to teach graduate students and it's extremely useful thank you um can you hover mosque you made a reference to a name I've never heard couldn't couldn't even begin to spell it h-a-b-e-r-m-a-s Jurgen habermas he's a one of the leading German social theorists World social theorists one could say yeah okay um yeah um yeah that's it it could later share an anecdote to build Harbor miles but um to your point I think this this is really important to um well I I think I would now um generalize a little bit less than I've done in the book which was written with um uh students and young academics in mind which often [Music] um um spent have to spend a lot of time reconstructing complex arguments in their own words and not skipping that process by just copying pasting quotes Etc um this in my own teaching often what I feel most important and that's probably why I emphasized that but equally important is um not treating or text the same and there's a reason I assume you you mentioned a specific kind of dense text because you have to treat it differently to a popular science book with one idea which is then repeated in different examples and the art of note-taking or taking literature notes is really in realizing how much effort you have to put in uh relation to the text you're dealing with and it's maybe less about is it a dance text or a less dense tax but how familiar am I as a reader with the topic um I sometimes spend a lot of time with a book because I'm unfamiliar with the topic almost everything seems new and interesting to me so I write a lot of things down and then in the end I have to go back to the beginning because I have to rewrite something because I needed to understand something in the end of the book before I realized the importance of something that was mentioned in the beginning so these literature notes tend to be more like excerpts and a little bit more um um yeah longer and extensive but when I'm familiar with the topic I usually know what I want from a text um I'm interested in a particular argument I ignore everything that is um explained to readers who are new and maybe I don't even take a literature note but just extract what I need from it and put it directly into the subtle calcium as a comment um or a footnote or something like that Luman himself um had very brief literature notes so you often really have only a few words um on page seven it says something about organizational theory in regard of and you as an outsider you wouldn't know what's in the book just by Reading lumen's literature notes because they are so brief um but that's probably because he knew very well what he wanted to take from it and also um he's sometimes treated literature in a way I would not recommend to students um very Loosely sometimes you have trouble when you look at up the sources um how did he get that from this text um so it sometimes bothers a little bit on um being a little bit too um a couple year about about the sources but um the chords version of my long convoluted answer is the unfortunate it depends it really depends on um your previous knowledge and what kind of text you're dealing with and um I always try to get to the frame of an argument and trying to give myself an account so I don't repeat what an author is saying and take take the frame he's presenting me as a given but try to understand okay what is the particular perspective it and that is often something which is not explicitly mentioned and it's a little bit like a daily training of um being aware of the frames we are presented with Lumen was really good at that I often read text by him just to understand the relationships between different um uh schools of thought that better um I think yeah yeah you can put it that way and that makes sense um may I ask one quick follow-up Michael or should I yeah go for it you do you take what I would call I guess commentary notes I'll be I'll be slightly procedures and say Tom eudic type notes essentially here's a passage and here's a commentary on that Passage that's one way of course of avoiding strict paraphrase or extended paraphrase which is hard I have a hard time when I'm reading something dense where I'm trying to capture a thick meaning so I'm right now I'm reading the theory of communicative action and I'm teaching it and so you know every paragraph has something to say so I'm I'm thinking I'm trying to break out of the overly close paraphrase problem and I'm wondering if he's commentary as a way of doing that make sense the question and take that as a comment yeah no yeah that was a comment it was a it was actually a question but it was a question that do you write commentary notes essentially yeah extended commentary here's a very brief you know three sentence summary two sentence summary of a extended passage and now I'm going to write commentary on that in your own words obviously um I always read with an i two words possible connections Within Myself um so uh the literature nodes tend to be commentary really but again when I'm not that familiar with the topic I there is a loop before that and that is just trying to get it right first before I think about do I agree do I not agree do I um can I connected with this or that um so then it's more like a learning exercise um but in terms of the title cast and I'm trying to to get to the uh commentary and the uh question okay how how is that important for for what I'm working on uh as soon as possible so so it sounds like the first the first step you're paraphrasing in in your in their words to get to get that learning and then once you feel you've gotten to that point then you can start putting commentary is that what I heard you say yeah exactly and sometimes it's you have immediate uh lee uh a reaction to to attacks and feel okay you got it you you know what what that argument is about and and sometimes it takes longer um okay and then um a couple other new Concepts and we'll raise the Pascal on uh the uh or pulling for in just a minute but the uh polish print the couple other words you brought up so there's this distinction of a literary literature note versus a commentary note and then you talked about framing an argument and then you talked about summarizing the perspective of an argument can you can you drill down on that a little bit more because I never really thought of that distinction of a literature note before right well um lumen collected his literature nailed separately to the rest of his permanent melts and permanent notes is a term I used um settled custom notes and um so the literature notes are in his analog uh subtle custom just um the reference on one side and then on the other side on page something it says this and Page seven it says something else and from what I understood is that she spent the day at University rather reading and taking literature notes and in the evening when he was at home where he had his um growth and his actual subtle casting he went through it and thought about okay how's this relevant for what I've written in my settle custom somewhere and um so this is the the important process um the the permanent notes of lumen are very close to his own development of thinking so um you have note sequences which you almost find um verbatim in manuscripts um with um while the literature notes um well maybe you have to distinguish he had basically um two areas of settle casting his first set of cousin was much closer to traditional uh note-taking system because the literature notes were more extensive they are more like excerpts and the emphasis was more on the literature he was reading and after a theoretical break he started with the second and last settled custom which was different in regard to the emphasis on his own thinking so here you have a much bigger disconnect between the literature notes which didn't seem that important anymore to really note sequences um where he developed his own thinking and what I find interesting um in teaching uh Sarah cousin is that it is a system that kind of forces you to make up your mind about what you're reading and what you're thinking you can't just collect stuff because in the moment you look for connections and not just tag stuff or points to in another note but to express the connection between two notes in a full sentence this is where the thinking uh happens and um this is what feels unfamiliar for many people because um this is not the way it's being taught in school and University um usually to develop your own thoughts uh follow your own questions uh instead of giving the best account about what someone else has written um so I like about the system that it's a constant reminder to to make up your mind and to specify what you what you're thinking and if you think two notes um belong together um the subtle cast and kind of asks me um well in what way uh is it is it the same uh just same idea just put differently is it a contradiction is it an extension of an idea um and this is what I find interesting about working with that settled person that I constantly feel um it's not letting me get away with how thoughts Half Baked ideas about it's somehow the same um I I know that looking into Old notes I need to have specified and explicitly put the relationship between two ideas and most often it's a difference it's not the same it seems similar uh to authors using the same words but it's actually different and then I and write something about in one way that's different and this is what I found um very useful and for you and for you and then we'll get to our questions in just a minute for you the um it's less about the tool but more about the thinking so when you're saying zettel costume you're not referring to a particular tool you're thinking about a methodology whatever tool that one may have correct yeah yeah I think that's I think that's a a critically important Point okay uh Pascal you've been hands up and up for a long time hello there oh thank you for giving me the chance to speak and yes hi zonkey I really love your book really enjoyed it so oh yes my name is Pascal so I work in transfusion medicine in the UK uh so I do all of uh research and transfusion but also I use I've used various programs in my life I I've used um uh zotero Devon think and oxygen to keep notes uh and and again they've been fantastic but uh recently I've got myself into uh Tinderbox and uh on I've managed to find myself a few templates of how to implement zettel custom Into The Tinderbox system which is a fantastic way of keeping my records now what was difficult for me before using options is trying to link them together uh with having a sort of display name so it was um we had to put various uh uh I want to put this we we've tinned a box you can have um you can make it your own way so my latest updated Tinderbox or zettel custom if you will I have a lot of my notes in on in um in one of the folders we'll call them and it's linked up to so many notes uh and I find my what what's been very but it's been much better for me is to be able to find My Notes within zazetto castan uh because there's a lot a lot of notes that I put in there but it's about finding where you will pick them up and which one you want to include into my notes now what are the things we've uh Tinder Box but I've found as well was um because I used in the Box for various thing called projects for for my research uh but also for doing investigation at the hospital for example uh and um obviously I can't put them into one file of Tinderbox I have separate tint of Tinderbox files and so um the difference I think with Lumen he was always coming back home where we've won particular settle cast and looking through his notes and trying to make sense of what he's picked up throughout the day and to link them within his little cast and but for me um I I it's about one finding the time to go into myself in an evening and try to pick up the things that I've read and try to link them together so that's kind kind of my I find quite difficult his time but also um to actually go back into mazdatocaster every day to find the right length um I'd also to remember which node it's linked up to basically you had to read all the notes and I find The Tinderbox you're able to use something called display expression where they will you be able to look um at uh the note itself and it will give you an idea where you want to put it whereas with oxygen you almost have to maybe I'm not using it correctly but you almost had to read for a lot of your notes with the date and and to find which note it will be you'll be able to link it up together so that's my observation thank you oxygen or oxygen a number of times I'm not hearing it properly can you put a link to the obsidian obsidian yeah can you put that in the uh the link to the app so so obsidian reaction you Pascal I I um I need to look that up and how halting the Box uh um solves that problem I I do think that digitally you have the opportunity to have different areas of your subtle cast and which are structured differently so the pen and paper um works well with Note sequences where you extend ideas and put a thought to another thought plus you have the hyperlinks but the main characteristic is really these uh this kind of note sequences and um whenever I uh speak with people from your profession um the same uh problem arises and that is that he first of all you deal with a lot of new information that's constantly coming up and secondly you have to quickly um find what you need in a particular situation and I don't think there is a good solution at the moment from what I gather for uh in in the whole area of medicine but I think the digital Solutions be it obsidian and obviously Tinderbox SCA described it have the ability well you you can have a very hierarchical and structured area and at the same time uh parts of this structure can also be parts of a more Loosely structured cytical note sequence area so um I I have areas in my total custom which are highly structured this is more where I collect methods or questions when I do coaching or counseling because I want them at hand it's sometimes also the case that I think about them as part of an ongoing process is the right method um what are new findings about the efficiency of this method so I can link to them from other areas whereas more about research but I want to have this structured if if you deal with someone with anxiety you want to know uh what questions make sense and what are good reminders for yourself and I I can only assume it's similar um in in your field um probably more complex um but it's good to have the opportunity um instead of trying to use a research tool like lumen subtlecastle for um another kind of um information which is um yeah must be treated differently I guess I hope that makes sense too yes thank you and I'm a test you've been incredibly patient you're up but yeah so I was admitted yeah thank you um so I I'm a scientist and I work in the like chemistry and physics mostly also in the laboratory and there was the the the one Connecting Point which Professor Aaron said about the people working in the laboratory that and very often you know when you when you have a boiling acid in one hand and you need to write some observation you need to be very brief and you need to quickly note something which you will also be able to understand your observation and also often your students or other people also need to understand so there's this connection uh where we have to quickly form up formulate the the observation the problem and as briefly as possible and yeah this is something which really helped me also from your book and um jumping to my next comment about the question of Professor of Professor Friedland I also had the problem with the with the dance text reading the dance text and again Professor Aarons came to the rescue here because one one of the sentences which really resonated with me was that if you if you read something and you don't take the the nodes or the proper notes it's like you basically waste your time like if if you don't if you don't um put it into your own words which will force you to like we will check you check if you understand the problem and then we'll force you to briefly and relatively precisely formulate the problem and write it down then uh yeah you at some point you will just lose the time and what what helped me with those kind of things is I I needed to be to put some discipline on myself and really ask the questions all the time which parts are useful for me and when something is new everything seems to be useful but if you really focus on the things which which are useful at the moment and then you maybe put some comment that more on this or more on that subject you can find in this in this literature then you can you can go back to to it afterwards after you you forget maybe so what helped me in in short was to put in this discipline and really like I should focus on this I'm reading this book because I I try to learn about this specific problem or project thank you fantastic thank you for that yeah any uh any comment lucky or you may want to move on if your reaction the only comment is I'm um I'm always fascinated with laboratory notes um because um it's such a special genre of writing um so um there's great research from the development of laboratory notes how pacts um slowly become visible and have first informal names um yeah but but that's more a footnote uh comment hopefully hopefully you took away from that too how much you've impacted people and you're loved I mean everyone to a person said I've read your book and you've changed me so that's that's pretty cool um uh Joan you wanna jump in sure I have a question um hi we read your book in a book club of Rome research a couple of years ago along with how to read a book and you were foundational in setting up my way of processing information going forward um I had come to a point where I had read hundreds and hundreds of books and treaties and articles and it's turned the corner on productivity and understanding and information processing um I continue to use Rome research I do quantitative research but I use that information so I have that piece in the background but I use that information to inform creative teams on messaging so I take one part of my brain and then I put it into visualization so that creative people can then create advertising and messaging from it so I sort of straddle both and what I've noticed and working with Rome research is that I now see my brain patterns much more clearly it's literally when I work in it I can see my brain functioning and other people that I've spoken to since I become part of this PKM world is that people understand how their brains work much better and it really engages them and they feel like they're doing better thinking better writing better insights and I wanted to hear from you if one you've been part of that conversation or have heard those comments um and what your response to that it's an intuitive place to to land but I was wondering what if you had comments and insights on that um I I heard before that um it's the way um if you manage to come up with a system that works for you because I I still think um that um the subtle custom method is not a method you can just apply as a tool and then it works with magic you have to understand um the principles of it and then translate it into your own workflow and adapt it to your own needs just like you described it um how you did it for yourself and I think this adoption process um seemed to um force people to become more aware of their own thinking patterns and what they need from a note taking system and um then come up with with a structure that works for them so I think what you described is very much this translation process and when it works it's because you translated it um by being aware of your research needs and how note taking place into that and the title custom is probably just like a legal set of a few principles a few ideas and then you take the legal and build something your own but while you're building it consciously instead of just using a tool that is available or was taught in school um I very much can relate to what you described that it makes you more aware of um how you're thinking process works how it's structured and by being more aware of it you gain influence of it you can make decisions um oh maybe it's better I do this maybe um it's um better to be explicit about the relationships because I get the feedback when I come back to my notes and there is no uh description of the relationship there's just a link to another note I I'm getting frustrated so from now on uh I'm doing my future self a favor and doing what I um learned works best as a user so um it's probably the integrated feedback loop that allows you to to improve on on the thinking and note-taking and how it's interlocked so um yeah I can relate to what you said and it's something I I heard before interestingly with different kinds of setups and different kinds of tools um some was wrong some with obsidian um and now obviously and Tinderbox as well thank you you know that makes me think of another concept we often discuss in the in the community is this idea of incremental formalization and I and I believe that's kind of what you just said in that yo you'll take a note and then along the way you'll realize wait a minute I I didn't add something in what I should have or and then at that moment you can go ahead and add it and then what you realize is if you find yourself adding that kind of thing back multiple times then you'll realize then at the very beginning you'll learn at least that's what I've taught myself is that once I've been like found that I needed to be adding that thing two or three times then from the very beginning I start adding it immediately because of you know being kind to my future self I know my future self is going to want it whereas before I used to collect everything and then that was inefficient so then I collected what I was thinking I needed to know and I've learned the incremental formalization will then help me improve along the way uh does that make sense or totally and I'm going to steal that expression because I like it awesome all right uh uh you had a follow-up question then we'll go to Kim if I wouldn't ask this question Professor Evans I'm on the like younger side of the receiving I guess audience of your book and what the first thing which really resonates with me was your um let's say anarch anarchistic approach to the current you know manuals of research writing and all those things and I was wondering did you have any like negative response from the maybe the authors of the of those kind of books or maybe your professor colleagues at your University or something that well basically you yeah disapprove a lot of very um established theories about how one or students should learn um what first of all I'm the the professor title was already borrowed I'm not at the University currently um I'm freelancing um but well well the funny thing is um even though I worked in philosophy of education pedagogy and where you would think questions like uh writing note-taking learning um introductions into academic work should play a big role it's not really discussed um among my colleagues um it's it's it's a bit of a curiosity that I've written a book on note-taking but it's not discussed within the field there it's about more theoretical development philosophy education and it's it's almost like you have written a novel um it's something you mentioned uh in the coffee break but it's not really discussed and I haven't spoken with um um [Music] colleagues who follow a more systematic less anarchistic approach to note taking to use your words um but I often feel many of these introductory books um uh written not from a theoretical standpoint but more from an idea of how they think uh writing and note-taking works but it doesn't really it's a little bit like um when you speak with scientists and then hear what they say they do and then they when you look what they actually do it's often quite different um these um approaches where you go through these seven steps of reading understanding asking questions I don't know if anyone actually ever approached a text like this um looking at the title first and then deciding do I read it do I read it not um uh it's sometimes it it's a little bit like fantasy literature um yeah but I I haven't really had brutal discussions about that and and I like the idea that you put something out there and people can resonate with it and use it to their advantage we could as they needed and um if it doesn't work then here was another approach and um it's certainly not the only approach that works and it's probably works for a particular kind of um personality or interest even though some some things I would defend as universal like he should choose your system in a way that it counteracts to confirmation boys and not set your own writing up in a way that um increases your confirmation bias and I think technology can help with that a lot hey thank you hey uh Kim you're up yeah I had a question about how to set up the uh the actual case in terms of the index environment in terms of the you have your flea notes your literature notes purple notes and they're you're trying to set up relationships as sort of a daily management concept but you're trying how do you actually set up the index itself and I can never go I never got I read your books uh phenomenal uh books and thank you uh pretty much to meet with you today but what is how do you index it I mean I know we got links you can link things together but how do you set up the index thank you right um well Lumen himself had a typed on a typewriter typed index just alphabetically assorted um pointing not to every note that is related to a certain concept but more like I would call them but that's my um terminology entry notes so like when you point to a certain note you know okay that's a good way into the topic and sometimes it's what someone like Nick Milo might call maps of content so in Lumen settle custom you also I have this um concept notes um which points you in different directions so if you look up systems theory you might see specified links to um social systems um mechanical systems family systems Etc so that from the index you get from systems theory a link to this map of content where then you're distributed to different areas but that index is mapped out right you just you have to have the index abbreviated some way uh to tied it into maybe uh your link does that make sense well lumos was alphabetically sorted so what do you have in the digital version is of course um it Greater uh ability to um give yourself an overview um first of all you have the full text search so you know that you don't have to bother too much with indexing but whenever um you encounter a problem with complexity um when you search for something and two too many um uh results come up then it's often a good idea uh to write yourself something like an entry note um where you categorize um like Newman did on this maps of content cards so um it's a top down and bottom up approach in a way so whenever I feel it's getting too complex so I give myself an overview um I do have an alphabetic index but that's just that when I have a concept usually one word titles um that I give it an index tag so in the index it would just appear as an alphabetical list but um I also have an overview um like a dashboard or a starting page where I put more descriptive uh or notes with more descriptive titles which work like entry notes into a particular topic so it's not so much like in the index card where I point to different ways of speaking about systems or different ways of discussing ideology but from the starting page I point to my discussion of the problem with ideology in systems theory because I know okay that that's a topic um I have a lot of notes on and when I start with that note um I can go from there and it's top down and bottom up because whenever I feel okay there is a cluster building um I'm on um to add to that and um deliberately think about that so it's um it's getting onto the starting page but also especially in the beginning when you start with a set of cousin as you don't start from scratch it kind of makes sense to begin with a kind of brain down write down okay what are the questions I'm already thinking about and um use these um starting uh notes as a kind of backbone um so you have something to add to later um so the starting page will be mocs are also the plays within the subtle cast where you can deliberately think about is this something I actually want to work on I want to keep working on um or is it something that um it's it's not that much of an interest to me um so that that's a way of giving yourself an overview um yeah so index more alphabetic index pointing to one word titles and more topic um overview pointing more to notes with descriptive titles where you know okay there's a particular question being discussed thank you Doctor awesome thank you for insights and when you refer to Nick Milo it was Nick m-i-l-o and this idea of mapping of content is that what you're referring to yeah um I mean he stresses the idea of maps of content so I feel obliged to uh mention this name um uh um and I think it makes sense to to have this loose structure um that whenever you have too many notes within a cluster you give yourself an overview over that cluster on a new note and point to that note as the entry note um it makes sense yeah no no totally we just I've not heard that term before or that person before yeah we're adding them to the index of learning so that's awesome yeah good gotcha um anybody else have another comment thought questions about how we evolve this if not let's pop over to the uh while you're waiting for that so Fidel it wasn't actually Dominique Dominique had question two but Fidel had a comment last week that said um how does one avoid overwhelm you know after a while the slip box becomes massive for me uh how does one uh you know catalyze revision so that's some comments that Fidel gave us uh in the Forum can you respond to those two questions um it's a problem um and I treat it as part of the process um so what I described with um giving yourself an overview um that's often triggered by the feeling of being unoverwhelmed with something I have too many notes um I'm not sure where should I go I take that as a feedback that I should give myself overview over a note so um it's this system Theory idea of complexity builds app um just by itself that's the nature of things and then you have to invent something that reduces the complexity again and after having reduced the complexity uh now you can build up because you have more capacity for it generally um there is sometimes a different kind of overwhelm occurring and that is when people feel obliged to follow all Loose Ends um like like a zero inbox idea and that is impossible um when you yeah when you have uh something like a set of person where almost every note could be expanded on commented on and this is I think lesser technical um problem and more a question of the mindset uh you approach um this problem and um my solution to that is that those ideas and questions I find extremely important and I don't want to lose sight of um they will have the place on my starting page dashboard or one of the mocs everything else is um approached by Me was a kind of abundancy mindset that I don't feel I need to respond to every question in my subtle question I don't need to follow up all those ends on the contrary it's great to have more possibilities to follow up on than I have time to actually do so I I try to turn it around and think about it as well thankfully um I have a title cousin full of possibilities to continue working on um and when I add an idea um I don't have to follow it to the end I can just write down well interesting article from Michael Becker about dinner Brock's um in a way if I um in the future discuss that question look that up I don't have to look it up now um but it's noted I can pick up the thread in the future but I don't have to um so I I don't have a to-do list uh idea about my notes you leave yourself a breadcrumb if you will um exactly yeah and that goes back to the point I think that was being said later in that if you don't leave yourself that breadcrumb you're wasting time because you're eventually gonna have to find it again so if you give yourself that breadcrumb in the moment you can you can save yourself a ton of time from having to backtrack yeah okay um all right and then any other comments thoughts Mr Bernstein what how are you how are you how is this molding over for you you're on mute by the way there oh I'm just taking lots of notes yeah yeah me too it's really good um all right any other thoughts who else has some other Concepts like maybe um yeah Ian you've been you've been quiet as of many of you and Dave Rogers you you and art you tend to have ample comments maybe you guys can chime in and give us some of your reactions I'm enjoying this I don't um I read a lot I I feel as though I don't do myself a service by taking good notes I do a lot of highlighting and uh I probably should go back and and organize those somehow but I'm I'm happy to listen in and uh and get inspired I'm seeing a lot of good comments in the uh in the chat so well and I but I think that I think I think you just raised a really important point that we need to go back to and Professor earns is already mentioned this several times but there's this idea of that initial and we talked about this with um Sasha last week as well there or a couple weeks ago now there's that initial note that you take which is like that raw note that's undefined and if you're if you've done yourself a service you'll have cited it immediately where did it come from but it's still super raw and then there's that next step that he I think you called it a prominent note or a permanent note Dr Ernst that that that then starts getting curated it starts becoming is put into your own words it's refined it's it very well maybe its own Atomic note being there but it then also May link itself back up to one of these cons um concept notes or entry notes as as you as you said and that's that curation process and I think what a lot of people want to do is they want to jump from that initial collection all the way to Creation but there's some steps in between that need to be gone through to be able to really you know to the incremental formalization Concepts that we were talking about earlier that are critically important it cannot be skipped now do you agree with that or what's your reaction to that kind of observation of uh of how we go about because Dave Rogers and called himself out on it he's like I take notes but then I never really go back and it sounds like that Going Back part is where knowledge and thinking is happening yeah well in defense uh to highlighting even though I I know I um I was very kind to highlighting in the book but um I I sometimes feel it's a necessary in between step um that goes back to what I said in the beginning it really depends on the kind of um text you're reading um sometimes you need that in between step of highlighting first and then going through it a second time because only when you have read the whole thing you know um how certain arguments make sense or not and then you have the highlights and that's a good indication to jump back in and then take notes from there um but it's an in-between step it's not uh the alternative to write something about it in your own words so if you can skip the highlighting um uh step um great because then you can uh come as quickly as possible to where the actual thinking is happening and that is asking all the questions about how is this information relevant for what I have already written down somewhere else which after a while becomes equivalent to um things I'm thinking about um instead of thinking about what I'm thinking about you can just look into your setup custom because what you're thinking about is somewhere there and if it's not there you probably have not thought about it yet um so yeah I I just agree that um you have to immerse yourself in this step which sometimes feels a bit like it's slowing you down but I believe that's where new ideas are generated um spending some time with the questions of how is it related what's the importance of it um is there a counter argument Etc and being explicit about that writing it down brings your work forward yeah awesome art you haven't spoken yet oh yeah hi thanks for doing this Sirens um I have a question relating to the ingestion of ideas and and so you know I notice you've been holding a pen for a period during this uh this Meetup and you know my question is like we're Gathering thoughts and we're coming up with ideas ever more rapidly and uh they're coming in at perhaps opportunity in opportune times you may be near your computer you may be in inputting something into your mobile phone there are pen and paper and and and the old analog system has its own beautiful advantages and then of course there's a then the challenge of translating some of that into a into a computer system you know which sort of then ultimately contributes to your knowledge base my question is uh how do you manage um you mean what kind of tools I actually use not necessarily the tools because I I believe like the tools again you know can be found um to suit your requirements and everybody thinks differently but just in terms of your your ideological attitude towards um um okay now I'm taking this note how am I going to deal with it how am I ultimately going to get it into my uh what's the path your mind follows right um well I have a lot of different kinds of inboxes so to speak um so um when I'm on a walk um I um use my phone to take um audio notes and um I'm not very disciplined and going through them on the same day which would probably make sense um but they are they are there once in a while I go through them and check half of them because it's just one of these ideas that sounded good to me in in the moment uh but not an hour later um at play as well like okay it's an idea that comes from abundance you're on a walk 20 ideas yeah don't necessarily have to act exactly if it's really an idea I feel okay that that's a breakthrough then I set myself a reminder on my calendar um so it pops up um but if it's just on the list of audio notes um I go through it when it's convenient the same is with um having a paper notebook with me all the time I used that less for um touching ideas and more to elaborate on vague ideas I like scribbling around and drawing lines and write down what I don't want to forget often trivial things I just like the whole physical appeal of paper notebook um it's a way of being more peaceful um in my mind it's like um my thoughts are grounded in a way and if I don't know if that metaphor makes any sense to you but I feel if I just rely on my head alone they tend to spin around and the moment I have a pen in my hand and a paper in front of me um it's um yeah it it grounds them somehow um like even if you're doodling you're creating sort of the bounds and the structure of what you're up to yeah yeah for sure yeah and then I at the moment uh I I use a remarkable uh in e-paper uh notebook um but that's very specific because it's not really integrated into any other system it's just when I have meetings with people um I uh I think I might meet again or I like to meet again but I have just a collection of meeting notes um at hand and I wouldn't want to type while we are talking I think it's impolite um especially when my microphone is on um and it's also a bit random because sometimes it's just words and or things I want to look up someone had an idea I want to look up um so meeting notes um have their special place and um it's also a bit of journaling that it's more private that I feel I wanna um use um a proper handwriting tool with even though it's an eve uh tool but it it works in the same way I suspect going back to the brain though too there might be something with that physical connection behind your brain I mean I don't I don't know this but maybe moving your hand actually does something in the brain and laying down the pathways of the information well there are two things that I I noticed um first of all that's well known it slows you down and it's slowing down your own thoughts it's very helpful um but secondly um editing is so much more of a hassle and when I type I'm constantly rewriting a sentence when I write by hand I wouldn't constantly cross out what I've written um so I'm a little bit more deliberate and a little bit more forgiving with imperfect sentences so it's more likely that I fill a page when I have a pen in my hand just because there's a little bit of a higher threshold to editing um and I find that for rough drafts or for preparations for talks um extremely helpful because in the end you have a page full of ideas and I think twice about doing that again um so it's a kind of psychological trick on myself I guess so is there a log Jam and you're getting all of this into your final into your settle custom is there a point at which there there's a bit of a choke okay what's going to go in now how much time I'm going to devote to just grooming and and maintaining my my database how much time and how am I going to take these different sources analog a digital and from my voice recording um when there isn't like if I encounter an idea I find really valuable I make myself an out to to put them in subtle custom or go directly to it um okay but it's I I don't have such a um perfect routine with a dedicated time during the day where I go through it it's more I sometimes feel not um focused enough to continue working on a manuscript or uh and then it's it still works going through my notes and thinking about okay how can I combine it with what I've already written it's it's more like a um concentration question or um what kind of mood I am or what phase in a project I am so sometimes I'm working on a manuscript and I wouldn't touch my setup custom for days because now it's getting about okay it's it's about reviewing and going through the reviews and things like that and sometimes it's reading a book and I don't want to be distracted but for sure getting into the ideas of someone else um real quick though in that and I think there's a tendency that we've had in The Tinderbox Community where is you know is Tinderbox a settle constant or not is is is is it this kind of tool or not and you mentioned like sometimes I'll go days without touching my zettle costume as if it was you know and in your context and your implementation is as if it's something different and I think what's important for The Tinderbox Community for like for myself if you go to the extreme Tinderbox is both my subtle costume but it's also my writing environment it's also my publishing environment it's also so there's way and going back to Kim's point on indexing you know there's ways to set up your Tinderbox file so on you know off to the side is your Atomic notes your permanent notes your your the things you haven't curated and then over here is your writing and the template you're applying to it and your ability so I've used Tinderbox to publish literally 500 page reports right and those 500 page reports are then back to their permanent notes and then often their semi-un permanent notes so there's this this extreme of from The Collection stage to your contribution AKA your output and then we all invariably will use different tools at different times to help us get there yeah and and we were just talking about this last week where someone was says well is Tinder boxes that will cost it or not and the answer is yes or no it just depends on how you're choosing to use it any other tool so I just wanted to interject that comment or statement makes sense um uh all right anything else before we move on oh no no thanks so much for your answer I really appreciate it um you've been up for longer than Pascal so you jump back in yeah I I really like this idea of the multiple inboxes uh I was just going to say that like when I was in the meeting like face-to-face meetings like people really take it um well in a bad way when you start typing on your phone right or even laptop like so this is where I usually borrow the the iPad from my wife and I I write something with it with the pen because I like the digital uh the digital advantage of search later on and this is really like I think closely related to David's Islands right getting things done like you really have this peace of mind right when you um first of all when you write down what's what's on your what's on your mind or dictate like when you said you you when you are on a walk but the the second thing is I think the peace of mind is only uh like real when you know that you will come back to it like David Allens has this review um of all the notes uh idea which very closely relates to the Central Casting um processing of the fleeting notes right I think and and this connects more to the to the highlights which I think we could fix the problem of highlights if we treated them like fleeting notes so if we go back to them and process them then I think there is nothing wrong with the with the with the highlights I think the danger is that we often don't go back like in time when we are still when we still know why did we even highlighted this and then then this may become a problem yeah and you you miss this you missed this last week but on that very Point that's where uh Sasha had said even on those fleeting notes grab context right the second you create a fleeting note well why did you take that leave yourself that little context clue so that you will help you to be able to Circle back when you want to when you want to evolve it and I think that's really an important point you just made yeah but you know you you always think like I will know right I I I'm just highlighting it but yeah of course there's this this is the danger yeah I think yeah yeah especially if you're super busy you may forget within 20 minutes I mean you just got a lot going on your head and you're certainly forget in a couple of weeks uh um anything else no thank you awesome thanks uh Pascal oh thank you I think Massey is kind of pretty better than I was going to put it here um so I used to highlight as well in a lot of my books and I ended up reading the books again because um I couldn't remember what I highlighted these things but now I definitely just write everything so I use Devin think to kind of write my little notes I use my the iron insertion excuse me to write a little note and uh so then it shows into my inbox and when I get to my computer in the evening then I know I need to process and try to find this and add this to my Zephyr Castle in uh my Tinderbox um yeah and I use these as you said the fleeting knows pretty much what you said about the uh the inbox will be uh the first units would be in my inbox rather if I'm using a highlighted bit but yeah I agree with you awesome all right any other comments points reactions deadlift you've been super quiet we haven't heard from you in a while what's what's your uh which how are you reacting to this oh thanks for asking me directly I'm just listening and uh I'm uh there are so many um good Inspirations for me um I'm still working on my settled customer redesigning it whenever I have time I have a little bit to a high workload at the moment but um for me my the problem is linking uh of the notes um because for me a node is always um something more or less static and um I don't know my my thinking is uh evolving my thinking is changing over time but my nodes are aesthetic and that's my main problem with my digital title castle that I would like to uh the links is what solves my problem I I think but um I'm still not not very not too satisfied with how I'm doing it at the moment to get a more Dynamic approach to um to reorganizing uh the the the thinking um or no the the the knowledge that is in my notes and um I do like Tinderbox um for this approach because uh with the agents um dinner box is a very powerful tool to rearrange your notes and to um to later on have an idea and then to collect all the nodes that fit to this idea and that is that's what I'm trying to solve but I'm I'm still working on it and that look just to jump in on that real quick let me show you this and I think this really helps just for those people that are looking at this too so for those that are not familiar with Tinderbox this is a Tinderbox file let me go find you all again and you know here's a great example of I got a quote um let me go find that example here so if I go down here so you see I was I was interacting with a buddy of mine called Dixon uh his name's Dixon he works for Fujitsu and you know there's a lot going on here so you'll notice I went ahead and in this field where I say person I add in Dixon's name and I've got action code behind the scenes that automatically creates a note for me if it doesn't already exist called Dixon so this way I can go ahead and insert you know the permanent note that is the curated person that is Dixon here in this note and I got this quote for him for this event that we're going to be doing I then was able to take this and now this so I've got now two permanent notes I've got a note called Dixon and I now have a quote from Dixon on this particular day that's also using hook sort of searched to his permanent permission and consent that he's given me for using this quote I then can roll up and I've got another note I then call Post which is now another permanent note which is related to um the comment that I'm going to be making about the quote that Dixon did you know Dixon's great it's really interesting all that and then there's the picture of the of the quote that we've made but what's interesting there in terms of linking I now have another attribute called term very similar to person and there anything I'm writing in here will be automatically generating a term if it doesn't already exist and then linking to that term at which point then I could go in then Define those terms and so this process is now letting me create even more persistent notes and all of that is happening automatically and then I can then go back and incrementally evolve it and and handle that over time and then then one letter better one last kind of thing and showing this demonstration is that's like the input and curation methods and then it's the creation for me comes from then I'm reading that that Dixon's quote and I can start writing about what that means to me so that's now making it a commenting approach and then going to the method of publishing if you're then going to social media yo using hashtags and mention tags are critical in social media to drive attraction so leveraging Tinderbox templates I'm then able to then have Tinderbox automatically using action code create the hashtag and mention Cloud for me so then when I turn around and post this into LinkedIn for instance that happens all automatically as well so this kind of gives you an example for those that might be listening how you could a great example of using Tinderbox to collect some notes in the process of curation have that process create more notes even for you and then allow you to facilitate using the templating function to actually have immediate output um and that if you're if you're interested in that we can talk about that later uh happy to share how I'm doing that um yeah Pascal and uh Mateus you raise your hands real quick yeah sorry just very quickly to add to this I think the the danger around having a digital version um with this is I think with Lumen he was constantly looking at where this specie collection connection was happening whether this where would this fit in whereas if you have something quite automatic that you just put it under uh digitally will just link up to that note would you then go back to read the original knowledge before to eventually whether it's linking up to the to the new node so I think this is um an area we might need to look into at how to make sure that we go back and read the original note if that makes sense it totally does and by the way it just shined up uh you're in the in the um and the chat just brought up a really important point he says my zetel cost and my writing my environment my publishing environment this is also a risk for those who use emacs personally I find it helpful to switch between tools uh your I absolutely agree with you so what I tend to find is when I actually start to go try to publish the stuff I've written in xender in Tinderbox going into the new environment like LinkedIn or like word or like PowerPoint you know and Marshall mcluhan taught us this in 1964 the medium's the message as I'm going out of the medium that is Tinderbox and I start to use that message that stuff that I think is just so brilliant and I start putting it into the LinkedIn environment I realize well wait a minute this content's not really working in this particular environment so at that point of publishing in that new tool all I will invariably will be making changes and I and that absolutely happens as I go to word PowerPoint or any other Medium as well so I think there it's it's not all one tool all of these other tools do again macclennan had it right the medium is the message the medium you have used will influence your message your message will influence the medium so I think that's another good learning from from this all right we've got we're just starting to run over but we had another a couple other questions somebody else raised their hand but then dropped it who was it do I think it was Oliver yeah Oliver go for it yeah thank you very much uh Michael um I was a little bit dropping out so I don't know exactly the way of the discussion that was going but um uh to the point that sometimes the two are extension of our personal environments and brains everyone has its own tool and what you just showed Michael is the way you design your external brain and for someone else someone else it doesn't mean a thing right so it's it's the way it's it's tailored to your thinking and somehow Tinderbox allows you to create this kind of management environment to have this information flowing through you and that's what Nicholas Lumen when I turned to the beginning of the discussion also was saying that his settle cost is his communication partner right he's uh requesting things from him and so on and um I personally am still looking for my external brain I'm I'm working with Tinderbox on and off and I'm using it since I think 30 years when storybook came by I I was a storybook user first and I never came down to the one tool and I regret this I I'm always looking for uh for the best way and maybe I'm the one type that never can settle with one Tool uh because I'm constantly when I said it was one tool I constantly look at the features of another tool saying ah maybe you make it one decision uh let's go somewhere else and maybe What circus is telling us it's up to two it's uh it's the way you think and that needs to settle uh how do you deconstruct what you find reconstruct what you think and then construct for the environment where you publish and talk to right this is the deconstruct reconstruct construct segment and everyone has his own uh way of doing it so and then sometimes the two comes by and helps you a little bit like a protasis or something yeah it gives you a little kick and and and and speed you up in a sense but um what I'm learning from the discussions and the meetups that you do is what all kind of different ways people try to go down to solve this problem for themselves so I'm Amazed by all this creativity that you all have and trying to solve this everyone has the same problem yeah but everyone has an own way of solving it sometimes somehow Zoom could try to suggest one way but I'm not sure if if that's has he ever got the impression that people just take on his suggestions or do they just change those suggestions for the personal uh knowledge work I don't know maybe Mr orange could answer this go for it thank you uh stanky you're on mute sorry uh it resonates with something Joanne said earlier about uh the or how she described to tweak the tool to her own needs and um I think you're absolutely right that's that that that's how it works and it comes with the effect of probably being more aware of our thinking and how we structure it and um being more aware of the pros and cons of different tools um which probably wasn't that much of a discussion when there weren't so many different uh variations available but but I think you're absolutely right and that so we need go ahead so it's it's like it forces you to think about thinking right and and and design the design and so on it's a meta role yeah yeah the tools are kind of part of the metacognitive skills um that um that are interesting in themselves and maybe people who are drawn to trying out different things uh are also motivated by trying out how it affects the thinking so so it's maybe more than just The Shining you uh object problem it's maybe a curiosity about um thinking of Thanos and um it's a good thing isn't it so we are running a little late but we have two questions left and I want to make one comment just talking about now I'll start with the comment first I was talking to somebody out the other day and they're like well what's you know you know what's the best email client she asked me and I'm like well the reality is I actually use four email clients and I have one that I primarily use for my every of my everyday email emailing because I I prefer its UI I prefer some of the capability it gives me but when it comes down to Mac Mail I use the Mac Mail as well because it allows me to use hook and other things that the other client doesn't allow me to use and then when I need to perform search I use mailmate because mailmate is a markdown functionality and a better search function than any of the other ones all combined so you know just like a um you know when a construction person goes to a job they very well may have three or four different kinds of hammers they're all called the category of hammer but you know each of the different you know there's a rubber Hammer there's a larger Mallet you know sometimes the category of hammer you need two or three to be able to address your need in a particular job so getting hung up on one tool I think is dangerous uh frankly um but at the same time going overboard and having too many tools can also become problematic too you got to find that balance for yourself that's my comment uh two last questions um Fidel foreign thanks so much for this conversation it's been really useful I came a little bit late so I don't know if this has been handled and I had started reading uh smart notes I do confess that I did not finish reading the book uh this was maybe two three years ago my question is to uh is is so I'm just thinking uh what you said what you said about longhand really resonated powerfully with me and the reason it did was because I found that writing longhand is the thing which enabled me to finally finish writing a manuscript of a novel like just doing it digitally couldn't hack I couldn't do it and when I when I went long hand I finished it so what you said really resonated and my question to you is with zettel Casten and um let's say I've got some index cards I've got a physical index I've got physical index cards and um of my literature notes and my fleeting notes Etc and I'm trying now to like bring them together and construct meaning could you just talk me through what that process could look like with some physical cards like I know it's probably like look at this one look at that one put this together put that together but from your experience like I don't know if you just give like a snapshot overview of some of the steps what that would look like if it's possible first of all congratulations on finishing a manuscript that's always a big thing isn't it yes thank you and um so you're using an analog paper pen and paper based type of custom yes yes um have you come using a digital index in addition to the paper type of cousin because um I think it can work well together that you have the advantages of writing longhand um have the physical advantages of having the paper arranged and so on but the index um might work better in um just having a digital alphabetical list pointing to paper um that's how I would approach it if I decided to to go analog I'm not completely because the index can digitally be modified more easily um the alternative would be having smaller cards um alphabetically sorted very much like in a library um and then you can have on the cards also uh like mocs or hubs where you can point to different uh aspects but you have the problem yes these are not fixed notes but developing notes um you kind of have to squeeze in between and um but it worked for Lumen he he typed it and Captain index separately um but as a recommendation on a quick note I I would have a digital list um it can just be in text file um nothing fancy okay all right all right and uh we're gonna we're way over time but Matisse you get the last word what's your final question okay my final question is Dr irons what what stops you from making a Wikipedia type of notes like what would or or I should we call them like what would be your tips for let's say beginner um Advocates of settle custom uh wrong from doing a Wikipedia type of Etc content which means I mean by that that I think everything will be useful I want to put everything I I use I work in in science so I would like all the data everything under my hand but this is just not not possible due to time constraints what what would be something you you could say about that to help work the distinction is really important I I believe so I think it's an important question and to me it it helps um to keep in mind well if I just want to have information that's what the internet is for what actual Wikipedia is for because I can always look it up but when it comes to writing uh settled from a settled person I'm in a dialogue with um a communication partner and like with an actual uh partner I'm very familiar with I'm spending a life with um we don't have to tell each other everything all the time again and again we kind of know stuff so we can leave much bigger gaps than when we had to speak with someone else so I only write down what I assume I would forget otherwise I'm writing on the edges on the borders of my understanding so when I write something down then because I'm not yet really um clear about something it's it's a pro process of understanding of going beyond my current understanding it's not about recording what I already know and um so maybe that's a good or helpful metaphor that first of all you speak with someone who knows you very well so no need to explain everything all the time again and again and secondly it's about thinking on the borders of your understanding so if you struggle a bit to find the right words then it's good if it feels like a jaw where you just have to write down what's on your mind then it's probably not worth writing it down in the first place but that would be my answer uh excellent thank you I'm just writing that down I mean that I think that's a really powerful concept because that's where the incremental formalization if you're struggling with that then allow yourself to go through those revisions all right well I personally could could keep you on for gazillion more years this was just awesome uh everyone was given me virtual or real Round of Applause or collapse this was fabulous thank you so much for taking the time I really appreciate it and thank you very much and we'll uh hopefully have you again one of these days and please try and we'll get you on a Mac so we get you to play with Tinderbox and get you part of the community all right well is that everybody thank you very much thank you last bye-bye thank you all right thank you thank you everybody oh I'm Mr Bernstein are you still around foreign",

            {
                "content": "i've used the ideas from this book to create a mental model a framework a latticework a web of over 100 different book notes and a thousand different ideas i've created book notes on things like habits i've created book notes on things like learning and focus all of which we're going to be talking a lot about here today but the reason i've done this is because i believe the reason to good and efficient creating writing creating videos or other content lies in the intelligent organization of ideas and notes and this book is going to help people from all different backgrounds to get more done to write intelligently to think about their learning for the long run it's going to teach us how to take smart notes and ensure that they bring you and your projects forward the principles here are tried and tested and they're a note-taking technique not only does this book explain how it's going to work but also why instead of wasting your time searching for notes for quotes and for references you can focus on what really counts which is thinking understanding and developing new ideas in your writing this system inside of how to take smart notes is based off the legendary zedelkaston method developed by nicholas lumen who was a 20th century sociologist who also published a prestigious amount of work 70 books and more than 400 articles before his death you can see that today we're talking a little bit about habits we're talking a little bit about goals we're talking a little bit about learning here today and talking about focus as well getting a little bit more granular the first idea that i pulled out of the book of the six is preparation not iq and to sum it up the quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made the decision on the topic but if that's true and i wholeheartedly believe it is in the key to successful writing lies in the preparation it also means that the vast majority of self-help books and study guides can only help you to close the barn door correctly and according to the official rules not just a moment but many months after the horse has already escaped with that in mind it's not surprising that the single most important indicator of academic success is not to be found in people's heads but in the way that they do their everyday work in fact there is no measurable correlation between a high iq and academic success at least not north of 120 yes a certain intellectual capacity helps you get into academia and if you struggle severely with an iq test it is likely that you will struggle to solve academic problems too but once you're in a superior iq will neither help you to distinguish yourself nor protect you from failure my reflection here is that the perfect example of fixed versus growth mindset and how that hinders our ability in everyday life of course this book also speaks mostly about academia which is not something i'm familiar with but nowadays a lot of us are knowledge workers and responsible for creating work what i recommend here is to check out mindset by carol dweck for just more information on fixed versus growth mindset i think it's definitely worth checking out and i've got a whole entire mind map on it that i'll link for you down below the too long didn't read to the very beginning of how to take smart notes it's just knowing that iq which is something predetermined for the most part is not the major factor in determining our success even when knowledge and learning is a key component of what it is we do so what is the key component well people like angela duckworth and martin seligman did some research and they said self-discipline and self-control is what really is going to be the thing that dictates whether you're going to be successful or not in many different ways now i've also done book summaries on duckworth and seligman so if you're interested go and check those out but that's something you can check out at a later date something that might sound even scarier but you know the this like self-discipline and things like that might sound like oh i wish i could just rely on my iq but truly this just means that everything else we've learned on this channel things like how to set good habits how to set goals how to have a little bit of discipline those are all going to play a key part in our success as well as having a good system for taking notes which is something we're going to talk about and i think that's very empowering it's not something fixed but it's something that you can actually have an influence on that's going to dictate your success next we're looking into nicholas lumen and one quote that he has inside the book i never force myself to do anything i don't feel like whenever i am stuck i do something else which i think is something great to aim for we also think about in 30 years he published 58 books and hundreds of articles translations not included many of them became classics in their respective fields even after his death about a half dozen more books on diverse subjects like religion education politics were published in his name based on almost finished manuscripts lying around his office there are many more than a few colleagues that i know who would give a lot less to be half as productive in their whole lifetime as lumen was after his death a good structure allows you to do that to move seamlessly from one task to another without threatening the whole arrangement or losing sight of the bigger picture writing is not a linear process and we constantly have to jump back and forth between tasks it wouldn't make any sense to micromanage ourselves on that level but he collected his notes in a slip box in such a way that his collection became more and more than the sum of his parts his slip box became his dialogue partner main idea generator and productivity engine it helped him to structure and develop his thoughts and it was fun to work with because it worked so that's the story of nicholas lumen one of the pro most prolific academics in modern history but really it's less about lumen and how much of a genius he is and is really about the system that he's created and is using or has used sorry to be so prolific it's kind of like if he can do it so can i story more than anything else the main ideas here for me are that writing is not a linear process if you're bored or not interested in something you won't do your best work and it doesn't mean that you should stop altogether just find something that you are interested in and i think that's why this map is so great for me if i want to learn about something in particular of course i can dive in and look into that topic like if i wanted to learn just about habits i could pull this out i could learn a little bit more about focus i could learn a little bit more about habits whatever one i decided to grab on that day but if focus or habits are boring me or there's no good books in that area that i want to think about i've got all of these different ones that i could click and kind of choose my own adventure to find different things specifically with someone with a little bit of adhd this is a really good way to do it by collecting notes creating collections we can create something much larger than just a collection of our notes so for example i've been doing a question and answer period there's a form down below if you want to fill out a question i'd be happy to make a video for you answering your question and what i do is i lay this out i've got all of these thoughts all of these ideas and what i do is i put your question to the system i go out there and i find the answers that i think most reflect what would be helpful for you in your situation so i definitely think it's worth you going out and either checking out those videos that i'll do on the channel or also submitting your own question potentially i'll be the one answering the question for you so our next idea here is just about the slip box manual how do you use the slip box of nicholas lumen strictly speaking lumen has two different slip boxes he's got a biographical one bibliographical one which contains the references and brief notes on the content of the literature and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas mainly in response to what he read the notes were written on index cards and stored in wooden boxes and whenever he read something he would write bibliographic information on one side of the card and make brief notes about the content on the other side these notes would end up in the bibliographic slip box in a second step shortly after he would look at his brief notes and think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing he would then turn to the main slip box and write his ideas comments and thoughts on a new piece of paper using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the paper to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of the box he kept them usually brief enough to make one idea fit on a single sheet but sometimes you would add another note to extend a thought so the idea of the slip box here for me is really revolutionary often we try and take notes in a singular context and think that it's going to be helpful for us to remember something but we can think of this process like the mind maps i'd done before each one was great on their own but they really had no connection to the other mind maps meaning it was a good exercise to try and remember something for me but just not all that useful to all of us when we're trying to create something useful out of the content now with the slip box method which i'm using obsidian for this is that i this is the tool that i'm using i take all of these notes in the same place they can be connected and drawn from at any point in time in the future without much friction there's also something to be said i think for two different types of note taking bibliographic is like taking quotes and authors that i highlight from the books these are easy and quick to take down and there's something that you can do as you're reading and not interrupt your workflow the next piece is like reflections or putting things into your own words and this is something that they talk a lot about inside of make it stick i recommend you go and check out that book if you haven't already looked at it they talk about how putting something in your own words is a really powerful memory tool but now coming from how to take smart notes it also gives us this chance to think about how the work fits into our greater view of the entire system and of course this is absolutely what we're trying to do with our map as well it's just okay what are the main ideas of learning what are the main ideas of potentially habits or different things like focus and things that i want to know what are the main ideas and what's connected to it so i want to create my view of the world and i'm doing that through these content maps which are the light blue nodes as well so the next piece we're talking about is just the process of taking smart notes probably this is a big piece of what we're thinking about here so the process is really five different steps the first one is to make fleeting notes always have something at hand to write with capture every idea that pops into your mind don't worry too much about how you write it down or what you write it on these are fleeting notes mere reminders of what's in your head they should not cause any distraction put them on one place and which define as kind of your inbox and process them later the next is to make literature notes so whenever you're reading something make notes about the content write down what you don't want to forget and think about what you might use in your own thinking or writing you want to keep it very short be extremely selective and use your own words number three is to make permanent notes now turn to your slip box of course go through your notes that you made in step number one and two ideally once a day before you forget what it meant and think about how they relate to what is relevant for you and your own research thinking and interests step number four is to add your permanent notes to the slip box by filling each one behind filing each one behind the other one and etc we won't go over that too much because everyone's going to be using their own tools but number five is just to develop your own topics the questions the research and think about it from bottoms up from within the system see what's there what is missing and what questions arise so this is actually a tool that i've created as well this quote really kind of just speaks for itself no matter what tool you're using it's the process of taking smart notes but let me explain how i do it a little bit in each one of these steps step number one is to make fleeting notes of course and this for me looks like reading or listening to a book and highlighting the important points from the book that i think would make it into my summary this is great because it has the ability to store it inside of the cloud as well and it really limits the friction that goes on step number two for me is the ebook reader actually allows me to take small notes with each highlight as well and i use that section to make any connections to the previous ideas that i would want to remember when i move into step number three step number three is when i copy the highlights into obsidian and i add my own reflections in i organize them i try to do six to eight points per book step number four is luckily i can do steps number three and four together with obsidian as it has a really great interlinking system which is the map in the graph that you're seeing right here i just linked one page to another and i can easily see it inside of the graph and move around as i see fit step number five is to moving more towards now so instead of just book summaries i'm going to be trying to bring full topics and answering questions and forming my own arguments via the notes i've already created actually a quick plug for that how i read and summarized 100 different books is my very first kind of exploration note i'm going to call them so that's something that you can check out on the channel as well coming up so our next idea here is just the tools for taking smart notes so there are really four different things we want to keep in mind for taking smart notes getting the tools ready shouldn't take any more than five to ten minutes and ideally it's built right in as it is with my system but having the right tools is one part of the equation it is easy to get fooled by their simplicity many have tried them out with out really understanding how to work them and were expectedly disappointed with the results tools are only as good as your ability to work with them and i could say that it took me quite a long time to figure out exactly how i wanted to get obsidian to work for me you need something to capture ideas whenever and wherever they pop into your head wherever you use whatever you use it should not require any thoughts attention or multiple steps to write it down the system the reference system has two different purposes to collect references and the notes that you take during your reading the slip box some prefer old-fashioned pen and paper version to a wooden box and that's fine but computers really can speed up a relatively minor part of the work in the equation anyways things like adding links and formatting the references of course the thinking and the creating is the hardest part here finally the editor and we won't talk too much about that but luckily obsidian does both not a huge plug for obsidian but it is a cool tool there isn't that much that you truly need to take smart notes the paper notebook and flashcard might be the best option for you which is great i would say however there are a few tools that i personally like to use for each of these steps the first step i use two different tools first i use an audio book player and i know that's blasphemy to some of us out there but this allows me to take in information at any time on the go which is great for me however it's not great at creating notes or capturing thoughts so i actually also have an ebook version that i use to highlight and take notes in at the same time on the same device whether i'm using my phone or an ipad or something like that step number two the ebook reader i use usually has the option to pull up my highlights and notes all in one section so i pull that up and i use that as my permanent reference guide when i'm coming into step number three which is the tool that we're in right now and it's essentially my slip box obsidian it's amazing way to capture both references and reflections as well as organize my notes in a way that makes sense to me step number four is obsidian really covers this step as well without much need to think about it it's using a markdown editor which may take some time to learn if you're not familiar but it's really a friction free way to write and to format so definitely recommend checking out that process the next idea and the final idea actually is to think inside the box creativity cannot be taught like a rule or an approach to a plan but we can make sure that our working environment allows us to be creative with ideas it also helps to kind of keep the mind helps to keep in mind some creativity creativity inducing ideas about problem solving that might be counterintuitive it is worth it to dwell on this subject a little bit before you move on to the next step the preparation of the rough draft of the manuscript the real enemy of independent thinking is not external authority but our own inertia the ability to generate new ideas has more to do with breaking old habits of thinking than coming up with as many new ideas as possible for obvious reasons i do not recommend thinking outside the box on the contrary here we can turn the slip box into a tool for breaking out our own thinking habits our brains just love routines before new information prompts our brains to think differently about something they may take the new information to fit into the known or let it disappear completely from our perception usually we don't even notice when our brains modify our surroundings to make it fit its expectations we need therefore a bit of a ruse to break the power of thinking in routines so my reflection on this is that thinking in routines is the way that our minds are set up because we've got billions of bits of data coming at us every single day this is great of course because it means we're not stapled to the couch thinking about how weird it is that the entire universe is you know constantly right above us right we're floating on this convertible which is really weird but as far as coming up with truly creative work not so good for that well it's different because your brain is completely on autopilot so sake points out here an inversion on a common phrase might be the best way to go and also i recommend you go and check out inversion that's coming from the the book by shane parish the great mental models volume number one talks all about inversion and how you can use that to spur new ideas so in here thinking outside the box is worse than thinking inside the box so now we've got all these ideas these references these notes and it's the process of taking those notes making the references and doing your reflections but then letting the box come up with the ideas the connections in the path for your writing and creative work for me now to create a video all i need is a spark of idea which for me there isn't any shortage of while i'm reading and then i can find multiple connections even if they seem completely unconnected and create a completely new video in under an hour that's the true power of taking smart notes so those are the six big ideas preparation not iq nicholas lumen we've got the slip box manual got the process of taking smart notes the tools for taking smart notes and think inside the box now we're going to go into a couple of different tools the first one is just the process of taking smart notes which we already have gone over but i also want to talk about something from jim quick called the faster model and then digital distraction breaking your addiction so that you can actually put into place any of these ideas so the faster model is number one so we've got the faster model here we've got the acronym standing for forget act state teach enter review so i really like this model and the whole idea is essentially what you need to do here is follow this faster model and i won't go over each and every single piece but the way i used to do this is before each mind map and while reading i do two things you gotta turn off your phone and forget all the distractions while i'm mind mapping that's actually the process of learning or while i'm building these notes that's my process of learning for the state i always listen to music while i'm writing down my notes but as i'm reading i never listen to any music the next thing is teaching and of course that's what these videos are for next is entering so these videos are the perfect example of entering each week i'm committing to making one video so you want to enter something into your calendar and the next one is review so this is what the beauty of kind of how to take smart notes actually is for me it's essentially just saying okay you know i'm i'm making these notes but now i have a way to reference it now i have a way to come back and essentially relearn things right revisit things and that's extremely important as well so it's important to have a place in your notes where you can revisit and relearn things again and again the next tool that i wanted to talk about is digital distraction and this is something of course that's coming from cal newport and you're more than welcome to join the join the channel and get these tools all for yourself but how do we break digital addiction really it comes in three different steps number one is set up some rules some example rules are don't have social media apps on your phone turn off your notification and set up site blockers on your work computer those are three good rules the next piece is find other things to do don't sit around and stare at a wall instead find things that you enjoy doing that don't involve technology number three is to schedule your usage of course if you're not going to step away 100 from using technology and break that digital addiction all together we want to make sure that we are scheduling time blocks where you are going to use social media intentionally so definitely worth checking out there i really recommend that you join the youtube channel get access to the tools get access to all of the different tools that we've created every single white dot here is a new tool that you can implement in your life coming from some of the world's best authors that was how to take smart notes by sonky ahrens really really thank you for being with me here today and

believe the reason to good and efficient creating writing creating videos or other content lies in the intelligent organization of ideas and notes and this book is going to help people from all different backgrounds to get more done to write intelligently to think about their learning for the long run it's going to teach us how to take smart notes and ensure that they bring you and your projects forward the principles here are tried and tested and they're a note-taking technique not only does this book explain how it's going to work but also why instead of wasting your time searching for notes for quotes and for references you can focus on what really counts which is thinking understanding and developing new ideas in your writing this system inside of how to take smart notes is based off the legendary zedelkaston method developed by nicholas lumen who was a 20th century sociologist who also published a prestigious amount of work 70 books and more than 400 articles before his death you can see that today we're talking a little bit about habits we're talking a little bit about goals we're talking a little bit about learning here today and talking about focus as well getting a little bit more granular the first idea that i pulled out of the book of the six is preparation not iq and to sum it up the quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made the decision on the topic but if that's true and i wholeheartedly believe it is in the key to successful writing lies in the preparation it also means that the vast majority of self-help books and study guides can only help you to close the barn door correctly and according to the official rules not just a moment but many months after the horse has already escaped with that in mind it's not surprising that the single most important indicator of academic success is not to be found in people's heads but in the way that they do their everyday work in fact there is no measurable correlation between a high iq and academic success at least not north of 120 yes a certain intellectual capacity helps you get into academia and if you struggle severely with an iq test it is likely that you will struggle to solve academic problems too but once you're in a superior iq will neither help you to distinguish yourself nor protect you from failure my reflection here is that the perfect example of fixed versus growth mindset and how that hinders our ability in everyday life of course this book also speaks mostly about academia which is not something i'm familiar with but nowadays a lot of us are knowledge workers and responsible for creating work what i recommend here is to check out mindset by carol dweck for just more information on fixed versus growth mindset i think it's definitely worth checking out and i've got a whole entire mind map on it that i'll link for you down below the too long didn't read to the very beginning of how to take smart notes it's just knowing that iq which is something predetermined for the most part is not the major factor in determining our success even when knowledge and learning is a key component of what it is we do so what is the key component well people like angela duckworth and martin seligman did some research and they said self-discipline and self-control is what really is going to be the thing that dictates whether you're going to be successful or not in many different ways now i've also done book summaries on duckworth and seligman so if you're interested go and check those out but that's something you can check out at a later date something that might sound even scarier but you know the this like self-discipline and things like that might sound like oh i wish i could just rely on my iq but truly this just means that everything else we've learned on this channel things like how to set good habits how to set goals how to have a little bit of discipline those are all going to play a key part in our success as well as having a good system for taking notes which is something we're going to talk about and i think that's very empowering it's not something fixed but it's something that you can actually have an influence on that's going to dictate your success next we're looking into nicholas lumen and one quote that he has inside the book i never force myself to do anything i don't feel like whenever i am stuck i do something else which i think is something great to aim for we also think about in 30 years he published 58 books and hundreds of articles translations not included many of them became classics in their respective fields even after his death about a half dozen more books on diverse subjects like religion education politics were published in his name based on almost finished manuscripts lying around his office there are many more than a few colleagues that i know who would give a lot less to be half as productive in their whole lifetime as lumen was after his death a good structure allows you to do that to move seamlessly from one task to another without threatening the whole arrangement or losing sight of the bigger picture writing is not a linear process and we constantly have to jump back and forth between tasks it wouldn't make any sense to micromanage ourselves on that level but he collected his notes in a slip box in such a way that his collection became more and more than the sum of his parts his slip box became his dialogue partner main idea generator and productivity engine it helped him to structure and develop his thoughts and it was fun to work with because it worked so that's the story of nicholas lumen one of the pro most prolific academics in modern history but really it's less about lumen and how much of a genius he is and is really about the system that he's created and is using or has used sorry to be so prolific it's kind of like if he can do it so can i story more than anything else the main ideas here for me are that writing is not a linear process if you're bored or not interested in something you won't do your best work and it doesn't mean that you should stop altogether just find something that you are interested in and i think that's why this map is so great for me if i want to learn about something in particular of course i can dive in and look into that topic like if i wanted to learn just about habits i could pull this out i could learn a little bit more about focus i could learn a little bit more about habits whatever one i decided to grab on that day but if focus or habits are boring me or there's no good books in that area that i want to think about i've got all of these different ones that i could click and kind of choose my own adventure to find different things specifically with someone with a little bit of adhd this is a really good way to do it by collecting notes creating collections we can create something much larger than just a collection of our notes so for example i've been doing a question and answer period there's a form down below if you want to fill out a question i'd be happy to make a video for you answering your question and what i do is i lay this out i've got all of these thoughts all of these ideas and what i do is i put your question to the system i go out there and i find the answers that i think most reflect what would be helpful for you in your situation so i definitely think it's worth you going out and either checking out those videos that i'll do on the channel or also submitting your own question potentially i'll be the one answering the question for you so our next idea here is just about the slip box manual how do you use the slip box of nicholas lumen strictly speaking lumen has two different slip boxes he's got a biographical one bibliographical one which contains the references and brief notes on the content of the literature and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas mainly in response to what he read the notes were written on index cards and stored in wooden boxes and whenever he read something he would write bibliographic information on one side of the card and make brief notes about the content on the other side these notes would end up in the bibliographic slip box in a second step shortly after he would look at his brief notes and think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing he would then turn to the main slip box and write his ideas comments and thoughts on a new piece of paper using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the paper to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of the box he kept them usually brief enough to make one idea fit on a single sheet but sometimes you would add another note to extend a thought so the idea of the slip box here for me is really revolutionary often we try and take notes in a singular context and think that it's going to be helpful for us to remember something but we can think of this process like the mind maps i'd done before each one was great on their own but they really had no connection to the other mind maps meaning it was a good exercise to try and remember something for me but just not all that useful to all of us when we're trying to create something useful out of the content now with the slip box method which i'm using obsidian for this is that i this is the tool that i'm using i take all of these notes in the same place they can be connected and drawn from at any point in time in the future without much friction there's also something to be said i think for two different types of note taking bibliographic is like taking quotes and authors that i highlight from the books these are easy and quick to take down and there's something that you can do as you're reading and not interrupt your workflow the next piece is like reflections or putting things into your own words and this is something that they talk a lot about inside of make it stick i recommend you go and check out that book if you haven't already looked at it they talk about how putting something in your own words is a really powerful memory tool but now coming from how to take smart notes it also gives us this chance to think about how the work fits into our greater view of the entire system and of course this is absolutely what we're trying to do with our map as well it's just okay what are the main ideas of learning what are the main ideas of potentially habits or different things like focus and things that i want to know what are the main ideas and what's connected to it so i want to create my view of the world and i'm doing that through these content maps which are the light blue nodes as well so the next piece we're talking about is just the process of taking smart notes probably this is a big piece of what we're thinking about here so the process is really five different steps the first one is to make fleeting notes always have something at hand to write with capture every idea that pops into your mind don't worry too much about how you write it down or what you write it on these are fleeting notes mere reminders of what's in your head they should not cause any distraction put them on one place and which define as kind of your inbox and process them later the next is to make literature notes so whenever you're reading something make notes about the content write down what you don't want to forget and think about what you might use in your own thinking or writing you want to keep it very short be extremely selective and use your own words number three is to make permanent notes now turn to your slip box of course go through your notes that you made in step number one and two ideally once a day before you forget what it meant and think about how they relate to what is relevant for you and your own research thinking and interests step number four is to add your permanent notes to the slip box by filling each one behind filing each one behind the other one and etc we won't go over that too much because everyone's going to be using their own tools but number five is just to develop your own topics the questions the research and think about it from bottoms up from within the system see what's there what is missing and what questions arise so this is actually a tool that i've created as well this quote really kind of just speaks for itself no matter what tool you're using it's the process of taking smart notes but let me explain how i do it a little bit in each one of these steps step number one is to make fleeting notes of course and this for me looks like reading or listening to a book and highlighting the important points from the book that i think would make it into my summary this is great because it has the ability to store it inside of the cloud as well and it really limits the friction that goes on step number two for me is the ebook reader actually allows me to take small notes with each highlight as well and i use that section to make any connections to the previous ideas that i would want to remember when i move into step number three step number three is when i copy the highlights into obsidian and i add my own reflections in i organize them i try to do six to eight points per book step number four is luckily i can do steps number three and four together with obsidian as it has a really great interlinking system which is the map in the graph that you're seeing right here i just linked one page to another and i can easily see it inside of the graph and move around as i see fit step number five is to moving more towards now so instead of just book summaries i'm going to be trying to bring full topics and answering questions and forming my own arguments via the notes i've already created actually a quick plug for that how i read and summarized 100 different books is my very first kind of exploration note i'm going to call them so that's something that you can check out on the channel as well coming up so our next idea here is just the tools for taking smart notes so there are really four different things we want to keep in mind for taking smart notes getting the tools ready shouldn't take any more than five to ten minutes and ideally it's built right in as it is with my system but having the right tools is one part of the equation it is easy to get fooled by their simplicity many have tried them out with out really understanding how to work them and were expectedly disappointed with the results tools are only as good as your ability to work with them and i could say that it took me quite a long time to figure out exactly how i wanted to get obsidian to work for me you need something to capture ideas whenever and wherever they pop into your head wherever you use whatever you use it should not require any thoughts attention or multiple steps to write it down the system the reference system has two different purposes to collect references and the notes that you take during your reading the slip box some prefer old-fashioned pen and paper version to a wooden box and that's fine but computers really can speed up a relatively minor part of the work in the equation anyways things like adding links and formatting the references of course the thinking and the creating is the hardest part here finally the editor and we won't talk too much about that but luckily obsidian does both not a huge plug for obsidian but it is a cool tool there isn't that much that you truly need to take smart notes the paper notebook and flashcard might be the best option for you which is great i would say however there are a few tools that i personally like to use for each of these steps the first step i use two different tools first i use an audio book player and i know that's blasphemy to some of us out there but this allows me to take in information at any time on the go which is great for me however it's not great at creating notes or capturing thoughts so i actually also have an ebook version that i use to highlight and take notes in at the same time on the same device whether i'm using my phone or an ipad or something like that step number two the ebook reader i use usually has the option to pull up my highlights and notes all in one section so i pull that up and i use that as my permanent reference guide when i'm coming into step number three which is the tool that we're in right now and it's essentially my slip box obsidian it's amazing way to capture both references and reflections as well as organize my notes in a way that makes sense to me step number four is obsidian really covers this step as well without much need to think about it it's using a markdown editor which may take some time to learn if you're not familiar but it's really a friction free way to write and to format so definitely recommend checking out that process the next idea and the final idea actually is to think inside the box creativity cannot be taught like a rule or an approach to a plan but we can make sure that our working environment allows us to be creative with ideas it also helps to kind of keep the mind helps to keep in mind some creativity creativity inducing ideas about problem solving that might be counterintuitive it is worth it to dwell on this subject a little bit before you move on to the next step the preparation of the rough draft of the manuscript the real enemy of independent thinking is not external authority but our own inertia the ability to generate new ideas has more to do with breaking old habits of thinking than coming up with as many new ideas as possible for obvious reasons i do not recommend thinking outside the box on the contrary here we can turn the slip box into a tool for breaking out our own thinking habits our brains just love routines before new information prompts our brains to think differently about something they may take the new information to fit into the known or let it disappear completely from our perception usually we don't even notice when our brains modify our surroundings to make it fit its expectations we need therefore a bit of a ruse to break the power of thinking in routines so my reflection on this is that thinking in routines is the way that our minds are set up because we've got billions of bits of data coming at us every single day this is great of course because it means we're not stapled to the couch thinking about how weird it is that the entire universe is you know constantly right above us right we're floating on this convertible which is really weird but as far as coming up with truly creative work not so good for that well it's different because your brain is completely on autopilot so sake points out here an inversion on a common phrase might be the best way to go and also i recommend you go and check out inversion that's coming from the the book by shane parish the great mental models volume number one talks all about inversion and how you can use that to spur new ideas so in here thinking outside the box is worse than thinking inside the box so now we've got all these ideas these references these notes and it's the process of taking those notes making the references and doing your reflections but then letting the box come up with the ideas the connections in the path for your writing and creative work for me now to create a video all i need is a spark of idea which for me there isn't any shortage of while i'm reading and then i can find multiple connections even if they seem completely unconnected and create a completely new video in under an hour that's the true power of taking smart notes so those are the six big ideas preparation not iq nicholas lumen we've got the slip box manual got the process of taking smart notes the tools for taking smart notes and think inside the box now we're going to go into a couple of different tools the first one is just the process of taking smart notes which we already have gone over but i also want to talk about something from jim quick called the faster model and then digital distraction breaking your addiction so that you can actually put into place any of these ideas so the faster model is number one so we've got the faster model here we've got the acronym standing for forget act state teach enter review so i really like this model and the whole idea is essentially what you need to do here is follow this faster model and i won't go over each and every single piece but the way i used to do this is before each mind map and while reading i do two things you gotta turn off your phone and forget all the distractions while i'm mind mapping that's actually the process of learning or while i'm building these notes that's my process of learning for the state i always listen to music while i'm writing down my notes but as i'm reading i never listen to any music the next thing is teaching and of course that's what these videos are for next is entering so these videos are the perfect example of entering each week i'm committing to making one video so you want to enter something into your calendar and the next one is review so this is what the beauty of kind of how to take smart notes actually is for me it's essentially just saying okay you know i'm i'm making these notes but now i have a way to reference it now i have a way to come back and essentially relearn things right revisit things and that's extremely important as well so it's important to have a place in your notes where you can revisit and relearn things again and again the next tool that i wanted to talk about is digital distraction and this is something of course that's coming from cal newport and you're more than welcome to join the join the channel and get these tools all for yourself but how do we break digital addiction really it comes in three different steps number one is set up some rules some example rules are don't have social media apps on your phone turn off your notification and set up site blockers on your work computer those are three good rules the next piece is find other things to do don't sit around and stare at a wall instead find things that you enjoy doing that don't involve technology number three is to schedule your usage of course if you're not going to step away 100 from using technology and break that digital addiction all together we want to make sure that we are scheduling time blocks where you are going to use social media intentionally so definitely worth checking out there i really recommend that you join the youtube channel get access to the tools get access to all of the different tools that we've created every single white dot here is a new tool that you can implement in your life coming from some of the world's best authors that was how to take smart notes by sonky ahrens really really thank you for being with me here today and

and two ideally once a day before you forget what it meant and think about how they relate to what is relevant for you and your own research thinking and interests step number four is to add your permanent notes to the slip box by filling each one behind filing each one behind the other one and etc we won't go over that too much because everyone's going to be using their own tools but number five is just to develop your own topics the questions the research and think about it from bottoms up from within the system see what's there what is missing and what questions arise so this is actually a tool that i've created as well this quote really kind of just speaks for itself no matter what tool you're using it's the process of taking smart notes but let me explain how i do it a little bit in each one of these steps step number one is to make fleeting notes of course and this for me looks like reading or listening to a book and highlighting the important points from the book that i think would make it into my summary this is great because it has the ability to store it inside of the cloud as well and it really limits the friction that goes on step number two for me is the ebook reader actually allows me to take small notes with each highlight as well and i use that section to make any connections to the previous ideas that i would want to remember when i move into step number three step number three is when i copy the highlights into obsidian and i add my own reflections in i organize them i try to do six to eight points per book step number four is luckily i can do steps number three and four together with obsidian as it has a really great interlinking system which is the map in the graph that you're seeing right here i just linked one page to another and i can easily see it inside of the graph and move around as i see fit step number five is to moving more towards now so instead of just book summaries i'm going to be trying to bring full topics and answering questions and forming my own arguments via the notes i've already created actually a quick plug for that how i read and summarized 100 different books is my very first kind of exploration note i'm going to call them so that's something that you can check out on the channel as well coming up so our next idea here is just the tools for taking smart notes so there are really four different things we want to keep in mind for taking smart notes getting the tools ready shouldn't take any more than five to ten minutes and ideally it's built right in as it is with my system but having the right tools is one part of the equation it is easy to get fooled by their simplicity many have tried them out with out really understanding how to work them and were expectedly disappointed with the results tools are only as good as your ability to work with them and i could say that it took me quite a long time to figure out exactly how i wanted to get obsidian to work for me you need something to capture ideas whenever and wherever they pop into your head wherever you use whatever you use it should not require any thoughts attention or multiple steps to write it down the system the reference system has two different purposes to collect references and the notes that you take during your reading the slip box some prefer old-fashioned pen and paper version to a wooden box and that's fine but computers really can speed up a relatively minor part of the work in the equation anyways things like adding links and formatting the references of course the thinking and the creating is the hardest part here finally the editor and we won't talk too much about that but luckily obsidian does both not a huge plug for obsidian but it is a cool tool there isn't that much that you truly need to take smart notes the paper notebook and flashcard might be the best option for you which is great i would say however there are a few tools that i personally like to use for each of these steps the first step i use two different tools first i use an audio book player and i know that's blasphemy to some of us out there but this allows me to take in information at any time on the go which is great for me however it's not great at creating notes or capturing thoughts so i actually also have an ebook version that i use to highlight and take notes in at the same time on the same device whether i'm using my phone or an ipad or something like that step number two the ebook reader i use usually has the option to pull up my highlights and notes all in one section so i pull that up and i use that as my permanent reference guide when i'm coming into step number three which is the tool that we're in right now and it's essentially my slip box obsidian it's amazing way to capture both references and reflections as well as organize my notes in a way that makes sense to me step number four is obsidian really covers this step as well without much need to think about it it's using a markdown editor which may take some time to learn if you're not familiar but it's really a friction free way to write and to format so definitely recommend checking out that process the next idea and the final idea actually is to think inside the box creativity cannot be taught like a rule or an approach to a plan but we can make sure that our working environment allows us to be creative with ideas it also helps to kind of keep the mind helps to keep in mind some creativity creativity inducing ideas about problem solving that might be counterintuitive it is worth it to dwell on this subject a little bit before you move on to the next step the preparation of the rough draft of the manuscript the real enemy of independent thinking is not external authority but our own inertia the ability to generate new ideas has more to do with breaking old habits of thinking than coming up with as many new ideas as possible for obvious reasons i do not recommend thinking outside the box on the contrary here we can turn the slip box into a tool for breaking out our own thinking habits our brains just love routines before new information prompts our brains to think differently about something they may take the new information to fit into the known or let it disappear completely from our perception usually we don't even notice when our brains modify our surroundings to make it fit its expectations we need therefore a bit of a ruse to break the power of thinking in routines so my reflection on this is that thinking in routines is the way that our minds are set up because we've got billions of bits of data coming at us every single day this is great of course because it means we're not stapled to the couch thinking about how weird it is that the entire universe is you know constantly right above us right we're floating on this convertible which is really weird but as far as coming up with truly creative work not so good for that well it's different because your brain is completely on autopilot so sake points out here an inversion on a common phrase might be the best way to go and also i recommend you go and check out inversion that's coming from the the book by shane parish the great mental models volume number one talks all about inversion and how you can use that to spur new ideas so in here thinking outside the box is worse than thinking inside the box so now we've got all these ideas these references these notes and it's the process of taking those notes making the references and doing your reflections but then letting the box come up with the ideas the connections in the path for your writing and creative work for me now to create a video all i need is a spark of idea which for me there isn't any shortage of while i'm reading and then i can find multiple connections even if they seem completely unconnected and create a completely new video in under an hour that's the true power of taking smart notes so those are the six big ideas preparation not iq nicholas lumen we've got the slip box manual got the process of taking smart notes the tools for taking smart notes and think inside the box now we're going to go into a couple of different tools the first one is just the process of taking smart notes which we already have gone over but i also want to talk about something from jim quick called the faster model and then digital distraction breaking your addiction so that you can actually put into place any of these ideas so the faster model is number one so we've got the faster model here we've got the acronym standing for forget act state teach enter review so i really like this model and the whole idea is essentially what you need to do here is follow this faster model and i won't go over each and every single piece but the way i used to do this is before each mind map and while reading i do two things you gotta turn off your phone and forget all the distractions while i'm mind mapping that's actually the process of learning or while i'm building these notes that's my process of learning for the state i always listen to music while i'm writing down my notes but as i'm reading i never listen to any music the next thing is teaching and of course that's what these videos are for next is entering so these videos are the perfect example of entering each week i'm committing to making one video so you want to enter something into your calendar and the next one is review so this is what the beauty of kind of how to take smart notes actually is for me it's essentially just saying okay you know i'm i'm making these notes but now i have a way to reference it now i have a way to come back and essentially relearn things right revisit things and that's extremely important as well so it's important to have a place in your notes where you can revisit and relearn things again and again the next tool that i wanted to talk about is digital distraction and this is something of course that's coming from cal newport and you're more than welcome to join the join the channel and get these tools all for yourself but how do we break digital addiction really it comes in three different steps number one is set up some rules some example rules are don't have social media apps on your phone turn off your notification and set up site blockers on your work computer those are three good rules the next piece is find other things to do don't sit around and stare at a wall instead find things that you enjoy doing that don't involve technology number three is to schedule your usage of course if you're not going to step away 100 from using technology and break that digital addiction all together we want to make sure that we are scheduling time blocks where you are going to use social media intentionally so definitely worth checking out there i really recommend that you join the youtube channel get access to the tools get access to all of the different tools that we've created every single white dot here is a new tool that you can implement in your life coming from some of the world's best authors that was how to take smart notes by sonky ahrens really really thank you for being with me here today and

            {
                "content": "i've used the ideas from this book to create a mental model a framework a latticework a web of over 100 different book notes and a thousand different ideas i've created book notes on things like habits i've created book notes on things like learning and focus all of which we're going to be talking a lot about here today but the reason i've done this is because i believe the reason to good and efficient creating writing creating videos or other content lies in the intelligent organization of ideas and notes and this book is going to help people from all different backgrounds to get more done to write intelligently to think about their learning for the long run it's going to teach us how to take smart notes and ensure that they bring you and your projects forward the principles here are tried and tested and they're a note-taking technique not only does this book explain how it's going to work but also why instead of wasting your time searching for notes for quotes and for references you can focus on what really counts which is thinking understanding and developing new ideas in your writing this system inside of how to take smart notes is based off the legendary zedelkaston method developed by nicholas lumen who was a 20th century sociologist who also published a prestigious amount of work 70 books and more than 400 articles before his death you can see that today we're talking a little bit about habits we're talking a little bit about goals we're talking a little bit about learning here today and talking about focus as well getting a little bit more granular the first idea that i pulled out of the book of the six is preparation not iq and to sum it up the quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made the decision on the topic but if that's true and i wholeheartedly believe it is in the key to successful writing lies in the preparation it also means that the vast majority of self-help books and study guides can only help you to close the barn door correctly and according to the official rules not just a moment but many months after the horse has already escaped with that in mind it's not surprising that the single most important indicator of academic success is not to be found in people's heads but in the way that they do their everyday work in fact there is no measurable correlation between a high iq and academic success at least not north of 120 yes a certain intellectual capacity helps you get into academia and if you struggle severely with an iq test it is likely that you will struggle to solve academic problems too but once you're in a superior iq will neither help you to distinguish yourself nor protect you from failure my reflection here is that the perfect example of fixed versus growth mindset and how that hinders our ability in everyday life of course this book also speaks mostly about academia which is not something i'm familiar with but nowadays a lot of us are knowledge workers and responsible for creating work what i recommend here is to check out mindset by carol dweck for just more information on fixed versus growth mindset i think it's definitely worth checking out and i've got a whole entire mind map on it that i'll link for you down below the too long didn't read to the very beginning of how to take smart notes it's just knowing that iq which is something predetermined for the most part is not the major factor in determining our success even when knowledge and learning is a key component of what it is we do so what is the key component well people like angela duckworth and martin seligman did some research and they said self-discipline and self-control is what really is going to be the thing that dictates whether you're going to be successful or not in many different ways now i've also done book summaries on duckworth and seligman so if you're interested go and check those out but that's something you can check out at a later date something that might sound even scarier but you know the this like self-discipline and things like that might sound like oh i wish i could just rely on my iq but truly this just means that everything else we've learned on this channel things like how to set good habits how to set goals how to have a little bit of discipline those are all going to play a key part in our success as well as having a good system for taking notes which is something we're going to talk about and i think that's very empowering it's not something fixed but it's something that you can actually have an influence on that's going to dictate your success next we're looking into nicholas lumen and one quote that he has inside the book i never force myself to do anything i don't feel like whenever i am stuck i do something else which i think is something great to aim for we also think about in 30 years he published 58 books and hundreds of articles translations not included many of them became classics in their respective fields even after his death about a half dozen more books on diverse subjects like religion education politics were published in his name based on almost finished manuscripts lying around his office there are many more than a few colleagues that i know who would give a lot less to be half as productive in their whole lifetime as lumen was after his death a good structure allows you to do that to move seamlessly from one task to another without threatening the whole arrangement or losing sight of the bigger picture writing is not a linear process and we constantly have to jump back and forth between tasks it wouldn't make any sense to micromanage ourselves on that level but he collected his notes in a slip box in such a way that his collection became more and more than the sum of his parts his slip box became his dialogue partner main idea generator and productivity engine it helped him to structure and develop his thoughts and it was fun to work with because it worked so that's the story of nicholas lumen one of the pro most prolific academics in modern history but really it's less about lumen and how much of a genius he is and is really about the system that he's created and is using or has used sorry to be so prolific it's kind of like if he can do it so can i story more than anything else the main ideas here for me are that writing is not a linear process if you're bored or not interested in something you won't do your best work and it doesn't mean that you should stop altogether just find something that you are interested in and i think that's why this map is so great for me if i want to learn about something in particular of course i can dive in and look into that topic like if i wanted to learn just about habits i could pull this out i could learn a little bit more about focus i could learn a little bit more about habits whatever one i decided to grab on that day but if focus or habits are boring me or there's no good books in that area that i want to think about i've got all of these different ones that i could click and kind of choose my own adventure to find different things specifically with someone with a little bit of adhd this is a really good way to do it by collecting notes creating collections we can create something much larger than just a collection of our notes so for example i've been doing a question and answer period there's a form down below if you want to fill out a question i'd be happy to make a video for you answering your question and what i do is i lay this out i've got all of these thoughts all of these ideas and what i do is i put your question to the system i go out there and i find the answers that i think most reflect what would be helpful for you in your situation so i definitely think it's worth you going out and either checking out those videos that i'll do on the channel or also submitting your own question potentially i'll be the one answering the question for you so our next idea here is just about the slip box manual how do you use the slip box of nicholas lumen strictly speaking lumen has two different slip boxes he's got a biographical one bibliographical one which contains the references and brief notes on the content of the literature and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas mainly in response to what he read the notes were written on index cards and stored in wooden boxes and whenever he read something he would write bibliographic information on one side of the card and make brief notes about the content on the other side these notes would end up in the bibliographic slip box in a second step shortly after he would look at his brief notes and think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing he would then turn to the main slip box and write his ideas comments and thoughts on a new piece of paper using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the paper to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of the box he kept them usually brief enough to make one idea fit on a single sheet but sometimes you would add another note to extend a thought so the idea of the slip box here for me is really revolutionary often we try and take notes in a singular context and think that it's going to be helpful for us to remember something but we can think of this process like the mind maps i'd done before each one was great on their own but they really had no connection to the other mind maps meaning it was a good exercise to try and remember something for me but just not all that useful to all of us when we're trying to create something useful out of the content now with the slip box method which i'm using obsidian for this is that i this is the tool that i'm using i take all of these notes in the same place they can be connected and drawn from at any point in time in the future without much friction there's also something to be said i think for two different types of note taking bibliographic is like taking quotes and authors that i highlight from the books these are easy and quick to take down and there's something that you can do as you're reading and not interrupt your workflow the next piece is like reflections or putting things into your own words and this is something that they talk a lot about inside of make it stick i recommend you go and check out that book if you haven't already looked at it they talk about how putting something in your own words is a really powerful memory tool but now coming from how to take smart notes it also gives us this chance to think about how the work fits into our greater view of the entire system and of course this is absolutely what we're trying to do with our map as well it's just okay what are the main ideas of learning what are the main ideas of potentially habits or different things like focus and things that i want to know what are the main ideas and what's connected to it so i want to create my view of the world and i'm doing that through these content maps which are the light blue nodes as well so the next piece we're talking about is just the process of taking smart notes probably this is a big piece of what we're thinking about here so the process is really five different steps the first one is to make fleeting notes always have something at hand to write with capture every idea that pops into your mind don't worry too much about how you write it down or what you write it on these are fleeting notes mere reminders of what's in your head they should not cause any distraction put them on one place and which define as kind of your inbox and process them later the next is to make literature notes so whenever you're reading something make notes about the content write down what you don't want to forget and think about what you might use in your own thinking or writing you want to keep it very short be extremely selective and use your own words number three is to make permanent notes now turn to your slip box of course go through your notes that you made in step number one and two ideally once a day before you forget what it meant and think about how they relate to what is relevant for you and your own research thinking and interests step number four is to add your permanent notes to the slip box by filling each one behind filing each one behind the other one and etc we won't go over that too much because everyone's going to be using their own tools but number five is just to develop your own topics the questions the research and think about it from bottoms up from within the system see what's there what is missing and what questions arise so this is actually a tool that i've created as well this quote really kind of just speaks for itself no matter what tool you're using it's the process of taking smart notes but let me explain how i do it a little bit in each one of these steps step number one is to make fleeting notes of course and this for me looks like reading or listening to a book and highlighting the important points from the book that i think would make it into my summary this is great because it has the ability to store it inside of the cloud as well and it really limits the friction that goes on step number two for me is the ebook reader actually allows me to take small notes with each highlight as well and i use that section to make any connections to the previous ideas that i would want to remember when i move into step number three step number three is when i copy the highlights into obsidian and i add my own reflections in i organize them i try to do six to eight points per book step number four is luckily i can do steps number three and four together with obsidian as it has a really great interlinking system which is the map in the graph that you're seeing right here i just linked one page to another and i can easily see it inside of the graph and move around as i see fit step number five is to moving more towards now so instead of just book summaries i'm going to be trying to bring full topics and answering questions and forming my own arguments via the notes i've already created actually a quick plug for that how i read and summarized 100 different books is my very first kind of exploration note i'm going to call them so that's something that you can check out on the channel as well coming up so our next idea here is just the tools for taking smart notes so there are really four different things we want to keep in mind for taking smart notes getting the tools ready shouldn't take any more than five to ten minutes and ideally it's built right in as it is with my system but

                "content": "i've used the ideas from this book to create a mental model a framework a latticework a web of over 100 different book notes and a thousand different ideas i've created book notes on things like habits i've created book notes on things like learning and focus all of which we're going to be talking a lot about here today but the reason i've done this is because i believe the reason to good and efficient creating writing creating videos or other content lies in the intelligent organization of ideas and notes and this book is going to help people from all different backgrounds to get more done to write intelligently to think about their learning for the long run it's going to teach us how to take smart notes and ensure that they bring you and your projects forward the principles here are tried and tested and they're a note-taking technique not only does this book explain how it's going to work but also why instead of wasting your time searching for notes for quotes and for references you can focus on what really counts which is thinking understanding and developing new ideas in your writing this system inside of how to take smart notes is based off the legendary zedelkaston method developed by nicholas lumen who was a 20th century sociologist who also published a prestigious amount of work 70 books and more than 400 articles before his death you can see that today we're talking a little bit about habits we're talking a little bit about goals we're talking a little bit about learning here today and talking about focus as well getting a little bit more granular the first idea that i pulled out of the book of the six is preparation not iq and to sum it up the quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made the decision on the topic but if that's true and i wholeheartedly believe it is in the key to successful writing lies in the preparation it also means that the vast majority of self-help books and study guides can only help you to close the barn door correctly and according to the official rules not just a moment but many months after the horse has already escaped with that in mind it's not surprising that the single most important indicator of academic success is not to be found in people's heads but in the way that they do their everyday work in fact there is no measurable correlation between a high iq and academic success at least not north of 120 yes a certain intellectual capacity helps you get into academia and if you struggle severely with an iq test it is likely that you will struggle to solve academic problems too but once you're in a superior iq will neither help you to distinguish yourself nor protect you from failure my reflection here is that the perfect example of fixed versus growth mindset and how that hinders our ability in everyday life of course this book also speaks mostly about academia which is not something i'm familiar with but nowadays a lot of us are knowledge workers and responsible for creating work what i recommend here is to check out mindset by carol dweck for just more information on fixed versus growth mindset i think it's definitely worth checking out and i've got a whole entire mind map on it that i'll link for you down below the too long didn't read to the very beginning of how to take smart notes it's just knowing that iq which is something predetermined for the most part is not the major factor in determining our success even when knowledge and learning is a key component of what it is we do so what is the key component well people like angela duckworth and martin seligman did some research and they said self-discipline and self-control is what really is going to be the thing that dictates whether you're going to be successful or not in many different ways now i've also done book summaries on duckworth and seligman so if you're interested go and check those out but that's something you can check out at a later date something that might sound even scarier but you know the this like self-discipline and things like that might sound like oh i wish i could just rely on my iq but truly this just means that everything else we've learned on this channel things like how to set good habits how to set goals how to have a little bit of discipline those are all going to play a key part in our success as well as having a good system for taking notes which is something we're going to talk about and i think that's very empowering it's not something fixed but it's something that you can actually have an influence on that's going to dictate your success next we're looking into nicholas lumen and one quote that he has inside the book i never force myself to do anything i don't feel like whenever i am stuck i do something else which i think is something great to aim for we also think about in 30 years he published 58 books and hundreds of articles translations not included many of them became classics in their respective fields even after his death about a half dozen more books on diverse subjects like religion education politics were published in his name based on almost finished manuscripts lying around his office there are many more than a few colleagues that i know who would give a lot less to be half as productive in their whole lifetime as lumen was after his death a good structure allows you to do that to move seamlessly from one task to another without threatening the whole arrangement or losing sight of the bigger picture writing is not a linear process and we constantly have to jump back and forth between tasks it wouldn't make any sense to micromanage ourselves on that level but he collected his notes in a slip box in such a way that his collection became more and more than the sum of his parts his slip box became his dialogue partner main idea generator and productivity engine it helped him to structure and develop his thoughts and it was fun to work with because it worked so that's the story of nicholas lumen one of the pro most prolific academics in modern history but really it's less about lumen and how much of a genius he is and is really about the system that he's created and is using or has used sorry to be so prolific it's kind of like if he can do it so can i story more than anything else the main ideas here for me are that writing is not a linear process if you're bored or not interested in something you won't do your best work and it doesn't mean that you should stop altogether just find something that you are interested in and i think that's why this map is so great for me if i want to learn about something in particular of course i can dive in and look into that topic like if i wanted to learn just about habits i could pull this out i could learn a little bit more about focus i could learn a little bit more about habits whatever one i decided to grab on that day but if focus or habits are boring me or there's no good books in that area that i want to think about i've got all of these different ones that i could click and kind of choose my own adventure to find different things specifically with someone with a little bit of adhd this is a really good way to do it by collecting notes creating collections we can create something much larger than just a collection of our notes so for example i've been doing a question and answer period there's a form down below if you want to fill out a question i'd be happy to make a video for you answering your question and what i do is i lay this out i've got all of these thoughts all of these ideas and what i do is i put your question to the system i go out there and i find the answers that i think most reflect what would be helpful for you in your situation so i definitely think it's worth you going out and either checking out those videos that i'll do on the channel or also submitting your own question potentially i'll be the one answering the question for you so our next idea here is just about the slip box manual how do you use the slip box of nicholas lumen strictly speaking lumen has two different slip boxes he's got a biographical one bibliographical one which contains the references and brief notes on the content of the literature and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas mainly in response to what he read the notes were written on index cards and stored in wooden boxes and whenever he read something he would write bibliographic information on one side of the card and make brief notes about the content on the other side these notes would end up in the bibliographic slip box in a second step shortly after he would look at his brief notes and think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing he would then turn to the main slip box and write his ideas comments and thoughts on a new piece of paper using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the paper to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of the box he kept them usually brief enough to make one idea fit on a single sheet but sometimes you would add another note to extend a thought so the idea of the slip box here for me is really revolutionary often we try and take notes in a singular context and think that it's going to be helpful for us to remember something but we can think of this process like the mind maps i'd done before each one was great on their own but they really had no connection to the other mind maps meaning it was a good exercise to try and remember something for me but just not all that useful to all of us when we're trying to create something useful out of the content now with the slip box method which i'm using obsidian for this is that i this is the tool that i'm using i take all of these notes in the same place they can be connected and drawn from at any point in time in the future without much friction there's also something to be said i think for two different types of note taking bibliographic is like taking quotes and authors that i highlight from the books these are easy and quick to take down and there's something that you can do as you're reading and not interrupt your workflow the next piece is like reflections or putting things into your own words and this is something that they talk a lot about inside of make it stick i recommend you go and check out that book if you haven't already looked at it they talk about how putting something in your own words is a really powerful memory tool but now coming from how to take smart notes it also gives us this chance to think about how the work fits into our greater view of the entire system and of course this is absolutely what we're trying to do with our map as well it's just okay what are the main ideas of learning what are the main ideas of potentially habits or different things like focus and things that i want to know what are the main ideas and what's connected to it so i want to create my view of the world and i'm doing that through these content maps which are the light blue nodes as well so the next piece we're talking about is just the process of taking smart notes probably this is a big piece of what we're thinking about here so the process is really five different steps the first one is to make fleeting notes always have something at hand to write with capture every idea that pops into your mind don't worry too much about how you write it down or what you write it on these are fleeting notes mere reminders of what's in your head they should not cause any distraction put them on one place and which define as kind of your inbox and process them later the next is to make literature notes so whenever you're reading something make notes about the content write down what you don't want to forget and think about what you might use in your own thinking or writing you want to keep it very short be extremely selective and use your own words number three is to make permanent notes now turn to your slip box of course go through your notes that you made in step number one and two ideally once a day before you forget what it meant and think about how they relate to what is relevant for you and your own research thinking and interests step number four is to add your permanent notes to the slip box by filling each one behind filing each one behind the other one and etc we won't go over that too much because everyone's going to be using their own tools but number five is just to develop your own topics the questions the research and think about it from bottoms up from within the system see what's there what is missing and what questions arise so this is actually a tool that i've created as well this quote really kind of just speaks for itself no matter what tool you're using it's the process of taking smart notes but let me explain how i do it a little bit in each one of these steps step number one is to make fleeting notes of course and this for me looks like reading or listening to a book and highlighting the important points from the book that i think would make it into my summary this is great because it has the ability to store it inside of the cloud as well and it really limits the friction that goes on step number two for me is the ebook reader actually allows me to take small notes with each highlight as well and i use that section to make any connections to the previous ideas that i would want to remember when i move into step number three step number three is when i copy the highlights into obsidian and i add my own reflections in i organize them i try to do six to eight points per book step number four is luckily i can do steps number three and four together with obsidian as it has a really great interlinking system which is the map in the graph that you're seeing right here i just linked one page to another and i can easily see it inside of the graph and move around as i see fit step number five is to moving more towards now so instead of just book summaries i'm going to be trying to bring full topics and answering questions and forming my own arguments via the notes i've already created actually a quick plug for that how i read and summarized 100 different books is my very first kind of exploration note i'm going to call them so that's something that you can check out on the channel as well coming up so our next idea here is just the tools for taking smart notes so there are really four different things we want to keep in mind for taking smart notes getting the tools ready shouldn't take any more than five to ten minutes and ideally it's built right in as it is with my system but having the right tools is one part of the equation it is easy to get fooled by their simplicity many have tried them out with out really understanding how to work them and were expectedly disappointed with the results tools are only as good as your ability to work with them and i could say that it took me quite a long time to figure out exactly how i wanted to get obsidian to work for me you need something to capture ideas whenever and wherever they pop into your head wherever you use whatever you use it should not require any thoughts attention or multiple steps to write it down the system the reference system has two different purposes to collect references and the notes that you take during your reading the slip box some prefer old-fashioned pen and paper version to a wooden box and that's fine but computers really can speed up a relatively minor part of the work in the equation anyways things like adding links and formatting the references of course the thinking and the creating is the hardest part here finally the editor and we won't talk too much about that but luckily obsidian does both not a huge plug for obsidian but it is a cool tool there isn't that much that you truly need to take smart notes the paper notebook and flashcard might be the best option for you which is great i would say however there are a few tools that i personally like to use for each of these steps the first step i use two different tools first i use an audio book player and i know that's blasphemy to some of us out there but this allows me to take in information at any time on the go which is great for me however it's not great at creating notes or capturing thoughts so i actually also have an ebook version that i use to highlight and take notes in at the same time on the same device whether i'm using my phone or an ipad or something like that step number two the ebook reader i use usually has the option to pull up my highlights and notes all in one section so i pull that up and i use that as my permanent reference guide when i'm coming into step number three which is the tool that we're in right now and it's essentially my slip box obsidian it's amazing way to capture both references and reflections as well as organize my notes in a way that makes sense to me step number four is obsidian really covers this step as well without much need to think about it it's using a markdown editor which may take some time to learn if you're not familiar but it's really a friction free way to write and to format so definitely recommend checking out that process the next idea and the final idea actually is to think inside the box creativity cannot be taught like a rule or an approach to a plan but we can make sure that our working environment allows us to be creative with ideas it also helps to kind of keep the mind helps to keep in mind some creativity creativity inducing ideas about problem solving that might be counterintuitive it is worth it to dwell on this subject a little bit before you move on to the next step the preparation of the rough draft of the manuscript the real enemy of independent thinking is not external authority but our own inertia the ability to generate new ideas has more to do with breaking old habits of thinking than coming up with as many new ideas as possible for obvious reasons i do not recommend thinking outside the box on the contrary here we can turn the slip box into a tool for breaking out our own thinking habits our brains just love routines before new information prompts our brains to think differently about something they may take the new information to fit into the known or let it disappear completely from our perception usually we don't even notice when our brains modify our surroundings to make it fit its expectations we need therefore a bit of a ruse to break the power of thinking in routines so my reflection on this is that thinking in routines is the way that our minds are set up because we've got billions of bits of data coming at us every single day this is great of course because it means we're not stapled to the couch thinking about how weird it is that the entire universe is you know constantly right above us right we're floating on this convertible which is really weird but as far as coming up with truly creative work not so good for that well it's different because your brain is completely on autopilot so sake points out here an inversion on a common phrase might be the best way to go and also i recommend you go and check out inversion that's coming from the the book by shane parish the great mental models volume number one talks all about inversion and how you can use that to spur new ideas so in here thinking outside the box is worse than thinking inside the box so now we've got all these ideas these references these notes and it's the process of taking those notes making the references and doing your reflections but then letting the box come up with the ideas the connections in the path for your writing and creative work for me now to create a video all i need is a spark of idea which for me there isn't any shortage of while i'm reading and then i can find multiple connections even if they seem completely unconnected and create a completely new video in under an hour that's the true power of taking smart notes so those are the six big ideas preparation not iq nicholas lumen we've got the slip box manual got the process of taking smart notes the tools for taking smart notes and think inside the box now we're going to go into a couple of different tools the first one is just the process of taking smart notes which we already have gone over but i also want to talk about something from jim quick called the faster model and then digital distraction breaking your addiction so that you can actually put into place any of these ideas so the faster model is number one so we've got the faster model here we've got the acronym standing for forget act state teach enter review so i really like this model and the whole idea is essentially what you need to do here is follow this faster model and i won't go over each and every single piece but the way i used to do this is before each mind map and while reading i do two things you gotta turn off your phone and forget all the distractions while i'm mind mapping that's actually the process of learning or while i'm building these notes that's my process of learning for the state i always listen to music while i'm writing down my notes but as i'm reading i never listen to any music the next thing is teaching and of course that's what these videos are for next is entering so these videos are the perfect example of entering each week i'm committing to making one video so you want to enter something into your calendar and the next one is review so this is what the beauty of kind of how to take smart notes actually is for me it's essentially just saying okay you know i'm i'm making these notes but now i have a way to reference it now i have a way to come back and essentially relearn things right revisit things and that's extremely important as well so it's important to have a place in your notes where you can revisit and relearn things again and again the next tool that i wanted to talk about is digital distraction and this is something of course that's coming from cal newport and you're more than welcome to join the join the channel and get these tools all for yourself but how do we break digital addiction really it comes in three different steps number one is set up some rules some example rules are don't have social media apps on your phone turn off your notification and set up site blockers on your work computer those are three good rules the next piece is find other things to do don't sit around and stare at a wall instead find things that you enjoy doing that don't involve technology number three is to schedule your usage of course if you're not going to step away 100 from using technology and break that digital addiction all together we want to make sure that we are scheduling time blocks where you are going to use social media intentionally so definitely worth checking out there i really recommend that you join the youtube channel get access to the tools get access to all of the different tools that we've created every single white dot here is a new tool that you can implement in your life coming from some of the world's best authors that was how to take smart notes by sonky ahrens really really thank you for being with me here today and

                "content": "- Let's explore the top three insights from 'How to Take Smart Notes' by Sönke Ahrens. One of the big challenges around personal growth and development is remembering the many insights that we've come across throughout our everyday lives, from books, videos, podcasts, articles all kinds of interesting informational sources and while it can certainly be fun to passively consume interesting information. If we aren't able to recall that information at the moment when it could serve us best then we're really missing out on the bulk of the value from having consumed that information. Now, this book has completely transformed the way that I think about reading and learning in general. It's far more than just a guide on how to take better notes. It's a complete system for better understanding, comparing and revisiting insights over time. So it's really about making sure that you get the most value out of the ideas that you come across throughout everyday life. So let's dive into my three favorite insights from the book to help you decide whether or not it's the right book for you. Beginning with insight number one. The better way to store valuable ideas. A great note taking system should do two things very well. Number one, it should save you from having to remember absolutely everything on your own. You should be able to dump the information that you collect or the insights that you come across in to a trusted external system so that you can free up your brain to focus on other things. And number two, it should really support and facilitate the understanding, connecting and revisiting of interesting insights and information. And ultimately it's the second step that really separates what we're gonna cover here from traditional note-taking systems. And ultimately this is what makes for a better and more long-term personal knowledge management system where you're gathering new and interesting information and actually building on what you already know as opposed to just collecting new insights. Now, unfortunately, the issue with many common note-taking practices is that they prioritize convenience at the point of discovering or identifying an interesting insight rather than making it easy for you to revisit and connect ideas over time. So for example, I've used popular note taking apps like Evernote or Microsoft OneNote and they make it very convenient to be able to save links or articles or quotes or PDF or other interesting bits of information but it's less convenient to revisit and organize and sort through that information in the future. And the same is true when it comes to physical note taking like highlighting a passage in a book or writing a brief note in a margin, or even adding a post-it note to indicate interesting sections of a book. What all of these approaches have in common is that they really, like I said prioritize convenience when it comes to identifying or saving interesting information but they're less effective when it comes to revisiting that information. And really this comes down to two things. On the one hand often these systems are incredibly disorganized. You've dumped a lot of interesting information into the system, but it's difficult to wade through it and sort the relevant from the irrelevant. And then number two, in some cases if you are a very organized person and you meticulously maintain a clear structure for all the insights and information that you come across this is actually too rigid of a system for us to gain the full benefit of the insights that we've discovered because this is not how our brains operate. We don't sort information into carefully siloed or structured areas in our mind. Instead, we make dynamic and interesting connections between information. And that's something that we're gonna come back to here in a minute. But the system presented in the book is the slip-box method as used by Niklas Luhmann who is considered one of the most influential social theorists of all time. He published 58 books over a 30 year period and that's not including translations or other books. In fact, that were published based on his notes after his passing. And his method simply involves turning interesting insights into bite-sized linkable notes. And he did this in three steps. Number one, whenever he identified or discovered a new, interesting insight he would immediately capture that insight in a temporary or fleeting notes. He'd have pen and paper handy and he would quickly make a note to make sure he captured that idea before he forgot about it. Number two, within a 24 to 48 hour period while the idea was still fresh in his mind he would convert that temporary note into a more detailed and yet concise bite-sized permanent note. And then step number three is to take that permanent note, add it into his slip-box system by either adding it behind a closely related idea, referencing it from a closely related idea or finally referencing it from an index or entry point note. Now the power of the system isn't simply in capturing more and more insights over time, but rather it's about developing better ideas by understanding, comparing and revisiting interesting ideas over time. And to really make this system work we need to focus on two things. Number one, writing better notes and number two making interesting connections between those notes. So let's continue on to insight number two. The critical step that changes everything. The way that we construct notes is just as important as the system in which we store them. So building on what we covered in insight number one let's cover two common note-taking mistakes. Number one, we take a very passive approach to gathering information. So as I mentioned earlier, we might take links or articles or PDFs and just dump them into a system like Evernote or the same is true of physical note-taking. But this is a very passive approach where we're not really taking the time to process the insight or the information to make sure that we understand it at a deep level. Instead, we're simply just identifying something that's interesting and throwing it into our system so that we don't forget about it. Now, the second mistake that we make is we fail to capture the full context of the insight at the moment we discover it. Because in many cases an interesting quote or an interesting article might hold specific relevance to something that we're working on at that moment or something that we're experiencing in our lives. But all we do is capture the quote or the article or the idea. And in many cases, we fail to capture the context or what caused that particular insight or idea to create a breakthrough for us. So by ignoring the context, or at least not recording the context, we can really miss out on a lot of the value behind the idea. And I'm sure you've experienced this going back through notes from the past suddenly you find an interesting quote but you don't really remember why that quote was so important to you. This is the kind of thing that I'm talking about. If we fail to capture the context, then we lose a lot of the value that could have been captured had we actually identified that at the moment. Now the critical step when capturing insights is to rewrite them in our own words. So rather than just saving or noting something that is interesting we wanna take the time to digest the information and then convey it in our own words taking into consideration our own context. And in many ways, stripping away the original context and really just focusing on how that particular insight stands out to us and why it was interesting to us and how it can be applied to our overall knowledge system that we're building with the slip-box over time. Now, as you might remember there are three steps in the process. Step number one is to quickly make a temporary note just to identify something interesting. In many ways this is what we typically do when taking notes. But the second step is what we're focused on here which is rewriting that insight or that idea in our own words, to fit our own context. And this really comes with three significant benefits to this approach. Number one, it's a simple way to test our understanding of the insight. Number two, it helps to lock in our learning and boost retention. And number three, the note will of course include our unique context or perspective. Now, just to be clear each note should only convey a single idea or insight. So we're not trying to cover multiple things. We want a concise, bite-sized linkable note. It should be written in full sentences. It should make reference to the original source and it should be easily understandable by anybody else that's not familiar with the original source. And in terms of length the original slip-box system was written on individual index cards. So you kinda wanna aim for somewhere between one and three paragraphs as concise as is possible while still including the key information needed to understand the insight. So with that in mind let's put everything together by continuing on to insight number three. The key to deeper learning and retention. Individual insights have very limited value on their own, especially when we only really consider them within the original context in which they were originally discovered. Now the real power of knowledge and understanding is in making connections between diverse ideas. This is how we build a growing body of knowledge and understanding over time. So we wanna focus more on the connections between ideas than just on the ideas themselves. Now, as I mentioned earlier common note-taking involves organizing ideas based on topic or theme or in some cases based on the original source of that information. So we might have our favorite notes from a book that we've read or we might have our favorite quotes or ideas that relate to a specific topic. But this is not how our brains naturally operate. We don't organize information in our heads based solely on the topic or the theme or the original source. We might keep track of those relationships but we also make more dynamic connections between ideas from alternative sources and across themes and across topics. We have all kinds of interesting connections that we make in our heads. So rather than thinking about everything organized like a library we really wanna build a dynamic web of information. This is how our brains naturally operate and this is what we wanna achieve when building our own personal knowledge management system like the slip-box. Now the original approach used physical index cards and each card covered one idea and had a unique identifier. So for example, cards might be numbered 23, 24, 25 but if you wanted to insert a relevant insight between any of the cards that already existed in the library then you could simply name it 24A or 24B or 24B2. You could dynamically adjust the references so that you could insert a card with relevant cards. And better still you could create dynamic links between cards by simply referencing its original identifier. So if card number 24 had something to do with card number 196A well you could simply reference that unique identifier and show a connection between those two different ideas. Now, fortunately, today we have far better solutions in the form of applications and software. So tools like Obsidian and Rome Research make things much easier to create connections between closely related ideas. And these tools use something called bi-directional linking. So for example, if you have a one insight let's say it's talking about water and you wanna link it with another insight to do with ice well, you can simply make a reference from water to ice and automatically when you're browsing the ice reference you can see that there's a link coming from water. So it's a two way relationship. By linking A to B you can see that B has a link coming to it from A. Now there are three reasons why this method is so powerful. Number one, every connection enhances a system and our own thinking at the same time because when we make these connections we're being more intentional about how we wanna think about ideas. And we're actually sort of being the architect for our own brain. In that we're saying, this idea is connected to this idea. And by making that connection explicitly in a tool like Obsidian, we're now adjusting the way that we think and we're making that connection in our own heads. And of course, we can go back to Obsidian or other tools like this, and actually browse through these connections dynamically to really reinforce those relationships. Number two, much of creativity is based on combining and remixes existing ideas. So by facilitating these connections, we increase the odds that we're gonna have creative breakthroughs where we suddenly realize really interesting connections between what otherwise might be two separate ideas that we might not normally or naturally see the connection between. And number three, interesting connections inspire further exploration and research. So every time we make an interesting connection we unlock new opportunities. We're motivated to then explore new avenues that might've opened up, syncing those connections. And just as our body of knowledge grows over time we're of course inspired to fill in gaps and to extend things even further. So that's really the power of the slip-box system. We build this growing body of knowledge in which we can continue to extend, we can reference back to, we can continue to make interesting connections and it really allows us to take everything to that next level. Now let's talk quickly about how to apply these insights in your everyday life. Remember this all comes down to three steps. Number one, you make a quick temporary or fleeting note at the moment when you discover a new insight or idea that appeals to you. Number two, we take the time within 24 to 48 hours to convert that temporary note into a permanent note that we write in our own words to confirm that we understand the idea. And so that easily referenced back to it fully taking into consideration the original context in which we discovered that idea. And then step number three, we put it into our slip-box system and we make interesting connections between that new discovery and previous insights and ideas that were already stored in the system. Now, after reading this book I've been inspired to create my own slip-box system to store the many insights and ideas that I gather from the books that I read. And I'm going to be using Obsidian. It's a completely free tool. You can get it at obsidian.mdl. I'll include the link down in the episode description box. I've just started on this journey. So I've got a lot to learn, a lot to discover. I've just started to create some of my first cards, my first notes in the system. So I do plan to build this up a little bit but eventually I'm going to share some of the journey some of the process and my own experiences building a slip-box system. So if you're interested in following my progress there and hearing about the things that I learned along the way definitely subscribe to the channel and stay tuned for future updates. But that's it for this book summary.

                "content": "- Let's explore the top three insights from 'How to Take Smart Notes' by Sönke Ahrens. One of the big challenges around personal growth and development is remembering the many insights that we've come across throughout our everyday lives, from books, videos, podcasts, articles all kinds of interesting informational sources and while it can certainly be fun to passively consume interesting information. If we aren't able to recall that information at the moment when it could serve us best then we're really missing out on the bulk of the value from having consumed that information. Now, this book has completely transformed the way that I think about reading and learning in general. It's far more than just a guide on how to take better notes. It's a complete system for better understanding, comparing and revisiting insights over time. So it's really about making sure that you get the most value out of the ideas that you come across throughout everyday life. So let's dive into my three favorite insights from the book to help you decide whether or not it's the right book for you. Beginning with insight number one. The better way to store valuable ideas. A great note taking system should do two things very well. Number one, it should save you from having to remember absolutely everything on your own. You should be able to dump the information that you collect or the insights that you come across in to a trusted external system so that you can free up your brain to focus on other things. And number two, it should really support and facilitate the understanding, connecting and revisiting of interesting insights and information. And ultimately it's the second step that really separates what we're gonna cover here from traditional note-taking systems. And ultimately this is what makes for a better and more long-term personal knowledge management system where you're gathering new and interesting information and actually building on what you already know as opposed to just collecting new insights. Now, unfortunately, the issue with many common note-taking practices is that they prioritize convenience at the point of discovering or identifying an interesting insight rather than making it easy for you to revisit and connect ideas over time. So for example, I've used popular note taking apps like Evernote or Microsoft OneNote and they make it very convenient to be able to save links or articles or quotes or PDF or other interesting bits of information but it's less convenient to revisit and organize and sort through that information in the future. And the same is true when it comes to physical note taking like highlighting a passage in a book or writing a brief note in a margin, or even adding a post-it note to indicate interesting sections of a book. What all of these approaches have in common is that they really, like I said prioritize convenience when it comes to identifying or saving interesting information but they're less effective when it comes to revisiting that information. And really this comes down to two things. On the one hand often these systems are incredibly disorganized. You've dumped a lot of interesting information into the system, but it's difficult to wade through it and sort the relevant from the irrelevant. And then number two, in some cases if you are a very organized person and you meticulously maintain a clear structure for all the insights and information that you come across this is actually too rigid of a system for us to gain the full benefit of the insights that we've discovered because this is not how our brains operate. We don't sort information into carefully siloed or structured areas in our mind. Instead, we make dynamic and interesting connections between information. And that's something that we're gonna come back to here in a minute. But the system presented in the book is the slip-box method as used by Niklas Luhmann who is considered one of the most influential social theorists of all time. He published 58 books over a 30 year period and that's not including translations or other books. In fact, that were published based on his notes after his passing. And his method simply involves turning interesting insights into bite-sized linkable notes. And he did this in three steps. Number one, whenever he identified or discovered a new, interesting insight he would immediately capture that insight in a temporary or fleeting notes. He'd have pen and paper handy and he would quickly make a note to make sure he captured that idea before he forgot about it. Number two, within a 24 to 48 hour period while the idea was still fresh in his mind he would convert that temporary note into a more detailed and yet concise bite-sized permanent note. And then step number three is to take that permanent note, add it into his slip-box system by either adding it behind a closely related idea, referencing it from a closely related idea or finally referencing it from an index or entry point note. Now the power of the system isn't simply in capturing more and more insights over time, but rather it's about developing better ideas by understanding, comparing and revisiting interesting ideas over time. And to really make this system work we need to focus on two things. Number one, writing better notes and number two making interesting connections between those notes. So let's continue on to insight number two. The critical step that changes everything. The way that we construct notes is just as important as the system in which we store them. So building on what we covered in insight number one let's cover two common note-taking mistakes. Number one, we take a very passive approach to gathering information. So as I mentioned earlier, we might take links or articles or PDFs and just dump them into a system like Evernote or the same is true of physical note-taking. But this is a very passive approach where we're not really taking the time to process the insight or the information to make sure that we understand it at a deep level. Instead, we're simply just identifying something that's interesting and throwing it into our system so that we don't forget about it. Now, the second mistake that we make is we fail to capture the full context of the insight at the moment we discover it. Because in many cases an interesting quote or an interesting article might hold specific relevance to something that we're working on at that moment or something that we're experiencing in our lives. But all we do is capture the quote or the article or the idea. And in many cases, we fail to capture the context or what caused that particular insight or idea to create a breakthrough for us. So by ignoring the context, or at least not recording the context, we can really miss out on a lot of the value behind the idea. And I'm sure you've experienced this going back through notes from the past suddenly you find an interesting quote but you don't really remember why that quote was so important to you. This is the kind of thing that I'm talking about. If we fail to capture the context, then we lose a lot of the value that could have been captured had we actually identified that at the moment. Now the critical step when capturing insights is to rewrite them in our own words. So rather than just saving or noting something that is interesting we wanna take the time to digest the information and then convey it in our own words taking into consideration our own context. And in many ways, stripping away the original context and really just focusing on how that particular insight stands out to us and why it was interesting to us and how it can be applied to our overall knowledge system that we're building with the slip-box over time. Now, as you might remember there are three steps in the process. Step number one is to quickly make a temporary note just to identify something interesting. In many ways this is what we typically do when taking notes. But the second step is what we're focused on here which is rewriting that insight or that idea in our own words, to fit our own context. And this really comes with three significant benefits to this approach. Number one, it's a simple way to test our understanding of the insight. Number two, it helps to lock in our learning and boost retention. And number three, the note will of course include our unique context or perspective. Now, just to be clear each note should only convey a single idea or insight. So we're not trying to cover multiple things. We want a concise, bite-sized linkable note. It should be written in full sentences. It should make reference to the original source and it should be easily understandable by anybody else that's not familiar with the original source. And in terms of length the original slip-box system was written on individual index cards. So you kinda wanna aim for somewhere between one and three paragraphs as concise as is possible while still including the key information needed to understand the insight. So with that in mind let's put everything together by continuing on to insight number three. The key to deeper learning and retention. Individual insights have very limited value on their own, especially when we only really consider them within the original context in which they were originally discovered. Now the real power of knowledge and understanding is in making connections between diverse ideas. This is how we build a growing body of knowledge and understanding over time. So we wanna focus more on the connections between ideas than just on the ideas themselves. Now, as I mentioned earlier common note-taking involves organizing ideas based on topic or theme or in some cases based on the original source of that information. So we might have our favorite notes from a book that we've read or we might have our favorite quotes or ideas that relate to a specific topic. But this is not how our brains naturally operate. We don't organize information in our heads based solely on the topic or the theme or the original source. We might keep track of those relationships but we also make more dynamic connections between ideas from alternative sources and across themes and across topics. We have all kinds of interesting connections that we make in our heads. So rather than thinking about everything organized like a library we really wanna build a dynamic web of information. This is how our brains naturally operate and this is what we wanna achieve when building our own personal knowledge management system like the slip-box. Now the original approach used physical index cards and each card covered one idea and had a unique identifier. So for example, cards might be numbered 23, 24, 25 but if you wanted to insert a relevant insight between any of the cards that already existed in the library then you could simply name it 24A or 24B or 24B2. You could dynamically adjust the references so that you could insert a card with relevant cards. And better still you could create dynamic links between cards by simply referencing its original identifier. So if card number 24 had something to do with card number 196A well you could simply reference that unique identifier and show a connection between those two different ideas. Now, fortunately, today we have far better solutions in the form of applications and software. So tools like Obsidian and Rome Research make things much easier to create connections between closely related ideas. And these tools use something called bi-directional linking. So for example, if you have a one insight let's say it's talking about water and you wanna link it with another insight to do with ice well, you can simply make a reference from water to ice and automatically when you're browsing the ice reference you can see that there's a link coming from water. So it's a two way relationship. By linking A to B you can see that B has a link coming to it from A. Now there are three reasons why this method is so powerful. Number one, every connection enhances a system and our own thinking at the same time because when we make these connections we're being more intentional about how we wanna think about ideas. And we're actually sort of being the architect for our own brain. In that we're saying, this idea is connected to this idea. And by making that connection explicitly in a tool like Obsidian, we're now adjusting the way that we think and we're making that connection in our own heads. And of course, we can go back to Obsidian or other tools like this, and actually browse through these connections dynamically to really reinforce those relationships. Number two, much of creativity is based on combining and remixes existing ideas. So by facilitating these connections, we increase the odds that we're gonna have creative breakthroughs where we suddenly realize really interesting connections between what otherwise might be two separate ideas that we might not normally or naturally see the connection between. And number three, interesting connections inspire further exploration and research. So every time we make an interesting connection we unlock new opportunities. We're motivated to then explore new avenues that might've opened up, syncing those connections. And just as our body of knowledge grows over time we're of course inspired to fill in gaps and to extend things even further. So that's really the power of the slip-box system. We build this growing body of knowledge in which we can continue to extend, we can reference back to, we can continue to make interesting connections and it really allows us to take everything to that next level.

                "content": "- Let's explore the top three insights from 'How to Take Smart Notes' by Sönke Ahrens. One of the big challenges around personal growth and development is remembering the many insights that we've come across throughout our everyday lives, from books, videos, podcasts, articles all kinds of interesting informational sources and while it can certainly be fun to passively consume interesting information. If we aren't able to recall that information at the moment when it could serve us best then we're really missing out on the bulk of the value from having consumed that information. Now, this book has completely transformed the way that I think about reading and learning in general. It's far more than just a guide on how to take better notes. It's a complete system for better understanding, comparing and revisiting insights over time. So it's really about making sure that you get the most value out of the ideas that you come across throughout everyday life. So let's dive into my three favorite insights from the book to help you decide whether or not it's the right book for you. Beginning with insight number one. The better way to store valuable ideas. A great note taking system should do two things very well. Number one, it should save you from having to remember absolutely everything on your own. You should be able to dump the information that you collect or the insights that you come across in to a trusted external system so that you can free up your brain to focus on other things. And number two, it should really support and facilitate the understanding, connecting and revisiting of interesting insights and information. And ultimately it's the second step that really separates what we're gonna cover here from traditional note-taking systems. And ultimately this is what makes for a better and more long-term personal knowledge management system where you're gathering new and interesting information and actually building on what you already know as opposed to just collecting new insights. Now, unfortunately, the issue with many common note-taking practices is that they prioritize convenience at the point of discovering or identifying an interesting insight rather than making it easy for you to revisit and connect ideas over time. So for example, I've used popular note taking apps like Evernote or Microsoft OneNote and they make it very convenient to be able to save links or articles or quotes or PDF or other interesting bits of information but it's less convenient to revisit and organize and sort through that information in the future. And the same is true when it comes to physical note taking like highlighting a passage in a book or writing a brief note in a margin, or even adding a post-it note to indicate interesting sections of a book. What all of these approaches have in common is that they really, like I said prioritize convenience when it comes to identifying or saving interesting information but they're less effective when it comes to revisiting that information. And really this comes down to two things. On the one hand often these systems are incredibly disorganized. You've dumped a lot of interesting information into the system, but it's difficult to wade through it and sort the relevant from the irrelevant. And then number two, in some cases if you are a very organized person and you meticulously maintain a clear structure for all the insights and information that you come across this is actually too rigid of a system for us to gain the full benefit of the insights that we've discovered because this is not how our brains operate. We don't sort information into carefully siloed or structured areas in our mind. Instead, we make dynamic and interesting connections between information. And that's something that we're gonna come back to here in a minute. But the system presented in the book is the slip-box method as used by Niklas Luhmann who is considered one of the most influential social theorists of all time. He published 58 books over a 30 year period and that's not including translations or other books. In fact, that were published based on his notes after his passing. And his method simply involves turning interesting insights into bite-sized linkable notes. And he did this in three steps. Number one, whenever he identified or discovered a new, interesting insight he would immediately capture that insight in a temporary or fleeting notes. He'd have pen and paper handy and he would quickly make a note to make sure he captured that idea before he forgot about it. Number two, within a 24 to 48 hour period while the idea was still fresh in his mind he would convert that temporary note into a more detailed and yet concise bite-sized permanent note. And then step number three is to take that permanent note, add it into his slip-box system by either adding it behind a closely related idea, referencing it from a closely related idea or finally referencing it from an index or entry point note. Now the power of the system isn't simply in capturing more and more insights over time, but rather it's about developing better ideas by understanding, comparing and revisiting interesting ideas over time. And to really make this system work we need to focus on two things. Number one, writing better notes and number two making interesting connections between those notes. So let's continue on to insight number two. The critical step that changes everything. The way that we construct notes is just as important as the system in which we store them. So building on what we covered in insight number one let's cover two common note-taking mistakes. Number one, we take a very passive approach to gathering information. So as I mentioned earlier, we might take links or articles or PDFs and just dump them into a system like Evernote or the same is true of physical note-taking. But this is a very passive approach where we're not really taking the time to process the insight or the information to make sure that we understand it at a deep level. Instead, we're simply just identifying something that's interesting and throwing it into our system so that we don't forget about it. Now, the second mistake that we make is we fail to capture the full context of the insight at the moment we discover it. Because in many cases an interesting quote or an interesting article might hold specific relevance to something that we're working on at that moment or something that we're experiencing in our lives. But all we do is capture the quote or the article or the idea. And in many cases, we fail to capture the context or what caused that particular insight or idea to create a breakthrough for us. So by ignoring the context, or at least not recording the context, we can really miss out on a lot of the value behind the idea. And I'm sure you've experienced this going back through notes from the past suddenly you find an interesting quote but you don't really remember why that quote was so important to you. This is the kind of thing that I'm talking about. If we fail to capture the context, then we lose a lot of the value that could have been captured had we actually identified that at the moment. Now the critical step when capturing insights is to rewrite them in our own words. So rather than just saving or noting something that is interesting we wanna take the time to digest the information and then convey it in our own words taking into consideration our own context. And in many ways, stripping away the original context and really just focusing on how that particular insight stands out to us and why it was interesting to us and how it can be applied to our overall knowledge system that we're building with the slip-box over time. Now, as you might remember there are three steps in the process. Step number one is to quickly make a temporary note just to identify something interesting. In many ways this is what we typically do when taking notes. But the second step is what we're focused on here which is rewriting that insight or that idea in our own words, to fit our own context. And this really comes with three significant benefits to this approach. Number one, it's a simple way to test our understanding of the insight. Number two, it helps to lock in our learning and boost retention. And number three, the note will of course include our unique context or perspective. Now, just to be clear each note should only convey a single idea or insight. So we're not trying to cover multiple things. We want a concise, bite-sized linkable note. It should be written in full sentences. It should make reference to the original source and it should be easily understandable by anybody else that's not familiar with the original source. And in terms of length the original slip-box system was written on individual index cards. So you kinda wanna aim for somewhere between one and three paragraphs as concise as is possible while still including the key information needed to understand the insight. So with that in mind let's put everything together by continuing on to insight number three. The key to deeper learning and retention. Individual insights have very limited value on their own, especially when we only really consider them within the original context in which they were originally discovered. Now the real power of knowledge and understanding is in making connections between diverse ideas. This is how we build a growing body of knowledge and understanding over time. So we wanna focus more on the connections between ideas than just on the ideas themselves. Now, as I mentioned earlier common note-taking involves organizing ideas based on topic or theme or in some cases based on the original source of that information. So we might have our favorite notes from a book that we've read or we might have our favorite quotes or ideas that relate to a specific topic. But this is not how our brains naturally operate. We don't organize information in our heads based solely on the topic or the theme or the original source. We might keep track of those relationships but we also make more dynamic connections between ideas from alternative sources and across themes and across topics. We have all kinds of interesting connections that we make in our heads. So rather than thinking about everything organized like a library we really wanna build a dynamic web of information. This is how our brains naturally operate and this is what we wanna achieve when building our own personal knowledge management system like the slip-box. Now the original approach used physical index cards and each card covered one idea and had a unique identifier. So for example, cards might be numbered 23, 24, 25 but if you wanted to insert a relevant insight between any of the cards that already existed in the library then you could simply name it 24A or 24B or 24B2. You could dynamically adjust the references so that you could insert a card with relevant cards. And better still you could create dynamic links between cards by simply referencing its original identifier. So if card number 24 had something to do with card number 196A well you could simply reference that unique identifier and show a connection between those two different ideas. Now, fortunately, today we have far better solutions in the form of applications and software. So tools like Obsidian and Rome Research make things much easier to create connections between closely related ideas. And these tools use something called bi-directional linking. So for example, if you have a one insight let's say it's talking about water and you wanna link it with another insight to do with ice well, you can simply make a reference from water to ice and automatically when you're browsing the ice reference you can see that there's a link coming from water. So it's a two way relationship. By linking A to B you can see that B has a link coming to it from A. Now there are three reasons why this method is so powerful. Number one, every connection enhances a system and our own thinking at the same time because when we make these connections we're being more intentional about how we wanna think about ideas. And we're actually sort of being the architect for our own brain. In that we're saying, this idea is connected to this idea. And by making that connection explicitly in a tool like Obsidian, we're now adjusting the way that we think and we're making that connection in our own heads. And of course, we can go back to Obsidian or other tools like this, and actually browse through these connections dynamically to really reinforce those relationships. Number two, much of creativity is based on combining and remixes existing ideas. So by facilitating these connections, we increase the odds that we're gonna have creative breakthroughs where we suddenly realize really interesting connections between what otherwise might be two separate ideas that we might not normally or naturally see the connection between. And number three, interesting connections inspire further exploration and research. So every time we make an interesting connection we unlock new opportunities. We're motivated to then explore new avenues that might've opened up, syncing those connections. And just as our body of knowledge grows over time we're of course inspired to fill in gaps and to extend things even further. So that's really the power of the slip-box system. We build this growing body of knowledge in which we can continue to extend, we can reference back to, we can continue to make interesting connections and it really allows us to take everything to that next level. Now let's talk quickly about how to apply these insights in your everyday life. Remember this all comes down to three steps. Number one, you make a quick temporary or fleeting note at the moment when you discover a new insight or idea that appeals to you. Number two, we take the time within 24 to 48 hours to convert that temporary note into a permanent note that we write in our own words to confirm that we understand the idea. And so that easily referenced back to it fully taking into consideration the original context in which we discovered that idea. And then step number three, we put it into our slip-box system and we make interesting connections between that new discovery and previous insights and ideas that were already stored in the system. Now, after reading this book I've been inspired to create my own slip-box system to store the many insights and ideas that I gather from the books that I read. And I'm going to be using Obsidian. It's a completely free tool. You can get it at obsidian.mdl. I'll include the link down in the episode description box. I've just started on this journey. So I've got a lot to learn, a lot to discover. I've just started to create some of my first cards, my first notes in the system. So I do plan to build this up a little bit but eventually I'm going to share some of the journey some of the process and my own experiences building a slip-box system. So if you're interested in following my progress there and hearing about the things that I learned along the way definitely subscribe to the channel and stay tuned for future updates. But that's it for this book summary. If you have any questions or comments about anything that we covered here let me know in the comment section below, and again be sure to subscribe so you can follow my updates, learn from other interesting books like this and follow my own journey using the slip-box method.",

                "content": "[Music] okay so let's start again just before starting I want to remember you that we have a room of continuous mob programming where you are invited to contribute and test mob programming it's continuous experience during all the conference so please go there and know that you will find people and you can try stuff so let me present you Sanka I discover this thing a few months ago it just blew my mind because it's it make words and it explain mine connections about a lot of stuff but I just couldn't explain so it's really amazing and that's why I invited Sanka which is and thank you uncle to have written a book in English because most of the resources about the subject we're in German so not accessible to most people so thank you to have done that and please welcome zonka [Applause] thank you very much for the kind invitation and the very warm welcome especially as I'm I'm an outsider and I'm speaking about what might seem to be a rather obscure subject for a software developer conference and that is with the background of social sciences and liberal arts how to take smart notes especially in higher education on the example of a technique from the 1960s containing out of pen and paper in wooden boxes so thank you for that note-taking it seems even in higher education to be more of a sideshow not the real matter writing though is an issue for students and academics alike and that's what most students and professors struggle with the writing of a paper getting things published know taking it seems is just one tool among many and I try to convince you that is way more than that there's a plethora of study guides and self-help books for this writing papers getting things published aiming to help this writing and some of them address note-taking as well but what I try to convince you is that most of these books are based on underlying assumptions what the connection between note-taking and thinking is that doesn't fix the problem but actually aggravates it there are some people he have always taken note taking seriously richard fineman the Nobel Prize winner and great teacher of physics is one example so one day he got a visitor a historian great admirer of him and he looked around at his office and then on his desk and admired his notes and said something alike well these are great records of your thinking and instead of being flatter than nice fine men get a bit angry and said no no no these aren't records of my thinking they are my thinking progress and this Torian said well come on I mean the thinking happens in your head and then you write your ideas down right and phiman said no that's not how it works they are not a record it's working you have to work on the paper and this is the paper okay and we might be inclined to say okay fine calm down a bit there's a great admirer of yours and treating your notes like they're some precious artifacts and you'll get wound up in semantics but he isn't because it makes all the difference cognitive sciences and psychology etc seem to be mostly concerned about the inner workings of our mind and brain but among all the different theories and the different schools of thought they seem to emerge it's surprising consensus and the consensus is that notes or the external environment of our thinking is what matters most so notes on paper do not make contemporary physics or any other kind of intellectual endeavor easier they make them possible and so in the in a handbook for neuroscience it says in the beginning no matter how internal processes are implemented you need to understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding and that is what I want to talk about but not on the example of Feynman but from one of my academic heroes in my field social sciences and that's Niklas Luhmann someone probably few of you know because he's mostly known in Germany some parts of Japan surprisingly and other parts of the world but not so much in the english-speaking community the lumen was an outsider to his field as well trained in law he worked a 95 job in the German administration but the interesting bit happened in the evenings when he went home and did was most of us do reading about things he was interested in and he was taking notes while he was doing that and over time he accumulated quite a bit of notes and he started to think about how to handle this amount of notes and then after a short period with a scholarship in Howard where he explained target pastilla then Fame most famous sociologist what everything was wrong with her theory he came back taught a bit at the administrative school and then was discovered one of his early writings by the then famous helmet shell ski-in sociologist in germany he was who was looking for a professor for a new founded University and what he read from this outsider of his field made him ask lumen if he want to become professor for sociology problem lumen had no habilitation what is required in Germany at the time he had no dissertation written he didn't even have a sociology degree but within one year he handed all three things in and then he was asked in 1968 in his inaugural lecture so what's the project what you're working on and his answer became Fame because he briefly said well modestly theory of society duration 30 years costs none twenty and a half years later he published a book which I consider one of the greatest works in sociology which is the last chapter of his theory of society a two-volume book and in these almost 30 years he also published about 60 books hundreds of articles published on subjects like sociology law politics media administrative science philosophy art even love and you name it so that's impressive but that's not what draw me really into the method he used because whenever you was asked how on earth he was able to combine such vastly different topics and be so productive he said well I'm not doing that on my own I'm doing that with my settled custom my note-taking system what drama to it is that he also said well I only do things that are easy whenever I'm stuck I do something else I never forced myself to do anything I don't feel like and that sounded very attractive to me so his settle custom is actually papers in a wooden box up until 90,000 notes with an index of terms about at 1,250 entries that settle customers at the moment part of a research project at the University of Bielefeld they digitalized everything and try to understand and the inner-workings which are surprisingly simple and there are a lot of unfinished manuscripts left so even after he died he kept on publishing for years based on almost finished manuscripts many of my colleagues and myself would be happy to be half as productive during the lifetime how he was after he died so it seems like that is just an enormous amount of work to put into that here come up with a note-taking system like that but if you break it down it's just six notes a day and that doesn't include Saturdays and Sundays and I give you rough just a brief idea about how it works but then I want to talk a little bit more about the ideas behind it and why it makes such a difference for higher education a typical workday for a woman begins with reading and while he was reading he was taking literature notes very simple on a small piece of table of this size in just on page X it says y that's it on the back side you will find the source and then in the evening he would write the actual notes and he would go through his literature notes and stop thinking about well what does that mean for the projects and thoughts I'm developing and then he would would write that down in longhand in the way that it can still be understood by others or by himself a week a month ten years later which is probably the same and then he would give every note just in index he started with note number one the second node would be physically stored just behind it note number two three etc and then he would put Mew notes directly into the notes which are most related to so sometimes you will find a thought spread out over many notes which are just stored after each other by using slashes and numbers and letters he can branch out indefinitely so after note 1 if 2 is already given then it becames 1 a and cetera et cetera you have links in these red in red that connects to other notes related within the subtle Caston and it looks very much like like like hypertext and in some ways but it isn't and it's important to keep that in mind there are notes which contain just rough ideas about manuscripts with links to other notes which give you a kind of overview over a topic but there is nothing like a topic structure everything builds up from below so these are basically that that's basically it there is an index with terms but you have surprisingly few entries for each term because it's not an entry doesn't contain all the notes which are related to one subject but they are more like entries into a line of thoughts so you might look at one term look into that settle Kirsten and you find a kind of entry and then follow up on that that's the technique and granted that doesn't sound revolutionary especially not for today it rather sounds like a needlessly laborious pen and paper version of what we can do with links and tax with almost any program so I'm gonna talk a little bit about the specifics about this and then compare it with what is usually taught in higher education because the main difference is what kind of workflow for the everyday routine this technique enforces and not so much what this tool taking as an isolated tool can do so the core features are the note sequences are really for developing ideas it's not so much about storing information so adding a new note develops an idea further secondly links and indices are helpful but not at all the central features they are just entries to get as quickly as possible into the thinking that happens on the notes the workflow is completely streamlined towards writing when he writes a paper he would take notes sequences out of the turtle casting put them in an order and then turn them into a written text and he said the time-consuming part is not the actual writing it's finding the right water because in the turtle cast and things are circular they are not in a linear way and trying to put it into a linear order that's the real challenge you can roughly distinguish between three different kinds of notes that are relevant at all fleeting nodes which are notes you take during the day but only reminders of what you have in your hat so you won't understand what you mean if you forget the connection they are just like oh that should mind me of that these are the kind of notes you chuck after a day and any of the literature notes which are in a separate box project related notes manuscript notes scribbled etc they might go into a project folder and then you have the permanent notes these are the main notes I've shown you before and they are understandable even if you forgot the context of where it came from so by having just one type of permanent note without any delusion of notes that are just fleeting a project related the settle casting enables you to build up a critical mass of ideas that then can spark newer ideas it's highly standardized everything regardless of the kind of literature or the source of an idea everything is treated in exactly the same way and everything ends up one idea one note same format and now when I talked a little bit about the status quo of Higher Education and how it is taught and I hope to show you what kind of difference that actually makes almost all study guides on writing for a linear approach it's almost always in kind of variation on the same idea well first you have to start with a topic you know what you have to write about then you go and do some research then you take notes then you draw conclusions and then you write it down proofread it and then it's about hitting or missing the deadline next project you again start with a new idea you have to have a research question and then you go through these steps again and you might think well that kind of makes sense because but you have to start with an idea for if you don't have an idea in the beginning you don't know work to begin and don't you have to make a plan for if you don't have a plan you're bound to wander around aimlessly and don't you have to make one step after another wouldn't you ever otherwise go in circles intuitively it makes sense and it's a linear order which raises the question what else do students have to do except writing papers well they have to go to seminars listening to lectures having discussions groups etc which means that is actually that if we change perspective and take seriously what Feynman's had that notes are not records of our thinking but that we think in our notes the whole picture changes and then we can start thinking about the inverse model isn't it rather that to be able to have a good research question you already have to have done a lot of research and how can you realistically make an educated guess of what kind of literature is worth reading if you haven't read a lot before and how can you realistically plan the process that is about insight about coming up with new ideas so it's about something that is per definition not foreseeable in the linear model the previous work or rather that all the things that should be accompanied by writing are compartmentalized as if they were a separate task and not the preparation of giving an account in a written form about the inside your hat if he is streamline everything towards writing you don't take anything away from listening to lecturers having discussions grew up attending seminars but you improve everything you have done before one quick look at the literature if you look at study guides for note-taking they have lists about what you are supposed to do for example first Google had collect notes for each course in one place in a separate notebook or section of a notebook well you end up doing what most students do they have a folder with notes to one lecture and then they have another folder for a different lecture and then they collect these binders in well that was the year I encountered this ideas that doesn't make any sense if you want to do something with the knowledge later on and then it prepares you to review what you have written which as I want to show you is another thing you really shouldn't do if you want to learn what you encountered it gets worse you get systems on how to read with five six steps with five six sub steps in between I spared you the most of the details but anyone who has ever read a book knows you you don't go through a checklist of like thirty five bullet points you kind of intuitively know how to approach different kinds of literature so the difference between using one tool in another tool if you focus on the workflow it enforces does make a difference on the one hand only written ideas count and that's that's especially richard fineman said if he can't explain it in your own words you haven't really understood it so it's focused on writing and it's not just one task among others and you can invert the whole process of how can you make it easier in the moment for the moment when you are about to write a paper so it's not you start with coming up with a research question but well um it isn't difficult to write a paper if you already have all the content sorted or notes right in front of you all you have to do is write a rough draft about that then it isn't difficult to put notes in order if you already have these nodes and an index where you can look them up and you might say well then it means that the main work is still to be done and that is writing these notes but this main work is not additional work you have to do on top of other things but that's the outcome of a change in a daily routine of the things you do anyway so you end up with a huge resource of notes not by doing additional work but by changing your routine of your everyday work a top-down approach where you start with a question immediately comes with a conflict of interest between having insight and getting things done because everything that is not in your plan like having insight or realizing that you had a wrong approach and you should do it slightly different becomes a problem of getting your paper done while when you start bottom up it doesn't really matter because in the end you can look up where things accumulated you this is obviously where things were so interesting that you came back to them again and again and material accumulated and that also means that if you start writing and make a informed decision about the topic and the question you're writing about it already comes with material so you don't have to guess if there is literature to that question that is worth reading and worth working with because you already know that and most often you're surprised because the things that are interesting in the end of the research process of not of things you've thought in the beginning were interested the questions in the end are usually very different to the questions you started with so if you have a top-down approach you're constantly bringing yourself into trouble categories emerge bottom-up and they are not enforced on your reading from the beginning that is the precondition for actual interdisciplinary work and the problem is higher education is that most knowledge already comes in modules so intuitively it makes sense to use the same categories and then just copy the knowledge into the same categories that comes with two problems there is no connection between these compartmentalized parts of knowledge it also comes with the problem that you don't elaborate on what he encountered because he just copy things into your own system and elaboration is what makes learning I say something about that in a second it's highly standardized and process orientated and I think you are fully aware of the importance of focusing on the process or the flow instead of the goal in academia it's not so obvious just a quick look at what it does for productivity the things in social sciences liberal arts if you work where or in philosophy where you work with text the things that really bring your project forward and usually the very things that don't feel productive at all and that is thinking understanding basically just sitting in your chair and staring out of the window it doesn't feel productive so there is the tendency to procrastinate and do something that feels immediately productive at the same time and that might be washing the dishes because we immediately see the outcome what can we set set accustomed means you turn these vague work of thinking making connections into concrete actions so understanding turns into writing a sentence writing in account of what you read in your own words which you can only do if you understand what you're writing about making connections is the physical act of looking through all the previous notes and thinking well how does this connect with that it's not happening in the brain it's a concrete action the focus on the process and not the outcome is much more motivating because if you focus on the outcome you're kind of failing every day until you reach your goal because up until then you haven't reached your goal but if you start focusing on the process and enjoying the process that's what the daily routine really is about writing is broken down as reasonable steps some study guides recommend well you have to write one page a day that doesn't make sense when writing a page sometimes means to do months of research reading and checking a lot of ideas away what does make sense is say write three four notes a day because that's just the outcome of well I read something when I fought a little bit well I made some connections so you have reasonable steps you can go and you can measure your progress because really I've written two or three notes a day that that's actual progress and I can do that every day you can't write a manuscript page every day and then the value of each idea can counts it is a little bit like the difference between putting a coin into a piggy bank once in a while or investing something with compounded interest if you store your notes in separate folders you're building an archive and the best thing is best-case scenario standing up was a big archive but if you put them in the settle cuff and they start to mingle with each other you have the ideas you tinker with that previews new ideas because if you take a note and try to put it behind another note and you first might realize well I already have that idea and actually that wasn't me that was someone else because now I see I've written about that before all you detect subtle differences and now suddenly have to think about what that difference means you have make to make a decision on what is this correct or is that correct does it add does it confirm or contradict what I thought before and that sparks new ideas which are new notes you don't have that if you work in a kind of archive the overall work process the clear distinction between permanent and temporary nodes can be compared to something like getting things done by David Allen in that case that everything ends up in an inbox and then you process everything and you have to make decision on each idea you're handling it is different to getting things done in that sense that now he can't start with the goal because it is about inside which you cannot foresee okay a quick word on learning what we know about learning today is first of all that it's not about storing information but it is about the question of retrieving information later from our memory and forgetting is not losing information but forgetting is the successful inhibition of information in our daily life that is a very useful mechanism we need otherwise we could it got overwhelmed with information and memories whenever we account encounter something so the successful intubation of memories is our normal state to circumvent that we have to make connections that make sense between the knowledge we encounter and the knowledge we have somewhere stored in our brain and that is what you actively do when you make connections between nodes [Music] interleaving is sorry spacing is basically the technique of the flashcards which you can use for learning vocabulary because it's better to space out a little bit and to once in a while come back to something you read instead of cramming it together the problem with flashcards is they don't come with context interleaving that means if you want to teach children to throw beanbags in a basket that's three meters away don't let them train throwing beanbags in a basket three meters away but let them train throwing beanbags in a basket key meters away and four meters away because in the end they will be better at throwing beanbags in a basket three meters away then those pupils he only trained with a three meter beam back even if they've never tried it before because that's how her brain works we need to make to look left and right and not focus on one thing at a time connecting is obvious self testing is the difference between what intuitively fields like progress in learning and what actually makes a difference in learning the most often used technique from students is reading something underlining some sentences and reading that again it doesn't do anything for learning it's it can just not do it what really makes sense is to put it away and try to find your own words to give an account of what you thought you already learned and then you pointed to your gaps in knowledge and that feels highly frustrating so even if you teach students that rereading doesn't make any sense because there are Studies on that and it's obvious and teach them that self testing works because their studies on that after four weeks they are back to rereading because it feels like progress because when they reread an underlined sentence the second time they think well that's familiar to me I know that but familiarity is not the same as competency or knowing it but it feels much better an elaboration basically is asking these questions about what your encounter what is it about what does it mean what does it mean for this and what does it mean for that how does it connect it's about swapping perspective from the argument of the author you're reading to well what does it mean in the context of my own argument it's about comparing contradicting complimenting confirming or specifying what you believe before which is what the settle Casson forces you to do every time you add a new note in terms of creativity first of all we go through different forms of attention every day in the linear model you're supposed to be creative four days to come up with a good research question then you have to be full of focused attention for a couple of weeks while you're reading and then you have to you have another form of attention again if you work with it set of kasnia constantly going back and forth through different forms of attention the brain is care about keeping factual knowledge we constantly reorganize our memories so it fits to our current idea of how things work the telecasting doesn't work that way it presents you with what you actually a week before a year ago but the brain is brilliant in comparing things and even and detecting even subtle differences but you can only do that if there are not in your brain but right in front of your eyes if you physically come tinker with them do something with them and only ideas that are able to mingle with each other can spark near ideas and the precondition is that that everything is in one place and not spread out and compartmentalized I recommend another big for those who are interested in learning let us make it sticks from three authors here are really good and giving an account of the current state of research and I just want to finish with some final thoughts and that is why I think it would be so important to have a digital version of the settle Caston that is easy to use that's open source and that can develop over time it's a very simple tool but I think it could be like the lever you use to change the way higher education works because we should stop teaching students to follow plans or checklist of 35 bullet points and give them the opportunity to learn the skill of independent research instead which is first and foremost the learned ability to make informed decisions about what is the most important task at any given moment in time and that might be reading more or doing a bit research more or writing another paragraph or going back to step 1 or jumping 1/2 to step 5 and this is a skill that can only be learned if you actually do that if you follow a plan you don't learn the skill you're stuck with learning following a plan real experts though a social scientists from Sweden says real experts don't mag plants they become experts in making informed decisions depending on the situation they are in we never start from scratch we never start with step one and there's no universal order of steps to take we always start somewhere and at some point in time a good note-taking system allows us to move freely between these tasks and develop our thinking long term not contained within one project and ideally it is something that builds up over time and allows us to have an external space to think in and I think there is a reason why this or comparable tools were not seen for the longest time in their importance and I think one of the reasons is that for the longest time we thought about thinking as something that just happens in our hat and why when we think that note-taking is not very important it's just a way of scribbling down what happened before here now that it's more common knowledge that it doesn't work that way but that we think with the tools we use and external have to externalize our thoughts then something like note-taking suddenly becomes the most important skill for students and those whose profession is to develop thoughts and this second more pragmatic reason might be that someone like Niklas Luhmann and his system was very contained in a rather obscure community of social scientists who were interested in systems theory almost all you can could read about that set of Kirstin was contained within the german-speaking community but really hope that it's in a way now the time to discover this or comparable methods of notetaking that maybe could be used to change the way learning and writing is taught in higher education thank you I think it's now Q&A is now are you doing the moderation or oh hey you are talking about that it would be nice to have a tool to do that like on your computer but don't you think it will destroy the process and part of the process is to note down manually the stuff and by the way I saw you had notes on the paper on kneeled so I like to know what you think about I think it's a it's a real problem because there are huge advantages to dealing with paper and one of the reasons is you can shuffle it around on your desk and even the physical putting it in gives it something haptic of that it works but at the same time it's really not very practical and sometimes it's nice to do a full-text search and just finding a note you remember it is in there I mean the main idea of the Turkish news that it points you to notes that you've long forgotten all the other systems require that the brain still remember somehow what's in but in many ways it's nice to have it all on your computer and have it transferable and not having to move around with a huge bit of furniture when you change flats yeah any other questions yeah so how do you do it today dear shoebox is full of paper cards or are you trying to go digital well I tried out different formats I have you two sheet boxes I gave up on that I'm using a to buy from a colleague of mine he's written a small program based on lumen set accustomed but it's a one-man show I mean he's it's not an open-source project but it's the only one that really tries to emulate that system so I'm using that at the moment but one of the reasons I was delighted about this invitation is to get the word out in the hope that something happens within the software developer community I don't know if it works that way but that's kind of my idea what zonker is trying to say is that it's an invitation for everyone to contribute and build that too because it doesn't exist in fact if you look at my pipes my webs in mind maps yes yeah one main difference is that it's about visualizing connections and it puts you in a perspective of trying to get an overview over parts why that set of custom draws you into it you don't have an overview it's like the complexity of your own brain you can wander around in it but you're not taking a step back and there are many tools who kind of try to give you the impression of having an overview and this rather works by pulling you into these already existing lines of thoughts so I I don't think it it works for that another question do you think wiki can walk as you're smart knocked bookshelf sorry Ricky do you think a wiki can do the trick for you yeah I think the main difference there is that you don't have these note sequences which are the main feature so all links are kind of the same but the the main feature of the subtle Caston is that you're branching out ideas and follow up on that so you can always come back to them and the moment all links are kind of equal you you lose that and it's more than again about storing information than about developing thoughts I'm sorry but we have to close the session to start the next session in time so thank you all and thank you sir [Music]",

back to another 00:00:11.200 episode of philosophers notes TV today 00:00:13.719 we've got another great book the art of 00:00:16.059 learning by Josh Waitzkin the art of 00:00:19.270 learning subtitle an inner journey to 00:00:21.880 optimal performance Josh Waitzkin is a 00:00:24.699 fascinating guy if you've ever heard of 00:00:26.740 the movie searching for bobby fisher' 00:00:29.260 you've heard of him he's the little 00:00:31.720 child chess prodigy in that movie which 00:00:34.600 was based on a book that his father 00:00:36.309 wrote about his experiences becoming one 00:00:39.100 of the best young chess players in the 00:00:42.190 country a national champion front no how 00:00:44.290 many years great great chess player and 00:00:47.739 then he got a little burned out and then 00:00:49.239 he became a world-class and world 00:00:51.040 champion martial artist in the martial 00:00:54.399 form of Tai Chi this book the art of 00:00:57.219 learning is all about how he mastered 00:00:59.440 both of those arts frankly I think 00:01:01.390 another title could be the art of 00:01:03.969 mastery because this book is really 00:01:06.039 about how do we master ourselves in our 00:01:08.619 craft and it's a great insight on how to 00:01:11.560 do that phenomenal book as always we've 00:01:13.990 got a philosopher's note with a bunch of 00:01:16.030 my favorite big ideas and as always 00:01:19.090 we've got five big ideas here let's have 00:01:21.580 fun taking a quick look so our first 00:01:23.890 idea is we need to understand two 00:01:27.130 different learning theories so Josh 00:01:29.770 kicks the book off with a look at our 00:01:32.790 orientations toward how we can learn so 00:01:35.680 he leans into Carol Dweck's research and 00:01:38.020 says we can have a fixed mindset an 00:01:40.659 entity mindset where we think we either 00:01:43.659 have it or we don't or we can have an 00:01:47.140 incremental mindset and as I often 00:01:49.540 mention when you read a book when I read 00:01:51.159 a book I can kind of see different words 00:01:53.439 or phrases that are used often this word 00:01:57.329 incremental II if it wasn't the most 00:02:00.040 often referred to theme it was one of 00:02:02.380 the most often referred to themes 00:02:04.170 incremental II Josh tells us we move 00:02:08.350 from novice to master B incrementally 00:02:13.870 one 00:02:15.620 improvement every single day we 00:02:18.170 aggregate and compound those 00:02:19.549 improvements and what do we get we moved 00:02:21.470 from novice to master so we need to 00:02:23.480 embrace the growth mindset Carol Dweck 00:02:26.480 style because the simple fact is if you 00:02:28.519 don't think you can improve your skills 00:02:30.230 you won't even put the effort in whether 00:02:33.409 you think you can do you think you can't 00:02:34.819 you're right there's a lot of wit a lot 00:02:36.769 of wisdom to that wit you need to be 00:02:39.049 willing to embrace an incremental 00:02:40.700 mindset that is a for our first big idea 00:02:43.579 so check in and see what is it that you 00:02:46.220 want to be great at do you think you can 00:02:48.470 actually become great if you're willing 00:02:50.690 to incremental II improve your skill set 00:02:53.079 fantastic if you don't well you're not 00:02:56.060 even going to look at any of this other 00:02:57.290 stuff because you're so fixed in the 00:02:59.030 idea that you either have it or you 00:03:01.099 don't 00:03:01.900 incremental it that's what it's about 00:03:04.310 the second big idea is what's your goal 00:03:06.650 Josh has a great line he says there's a 00:03:09.560 big difference between people who want 00:03:11.780 to be decent at what they do are they 00:03:15.709 want to be good at what they do and 00:03:17.690 those people that want to be great at 00:03:19.910 what they do and then the people that 00:03:22.130 want to be among the best at what they 00:03:25.459 do right so what's your goal and then he 00:03:28.730 also doesn't say it but his clear 00:03:31.010 personal goal was to be the very best 00:03:32.959 the absolute best at what he does big 00:03:37.250 difference between being decent 00:03:39.410 something versus wanting to be good or 00:03:41.930 great or among the best or the absolute 00:03:44.720 best so what starts there when you 00:03:47.780 imagine yourself in your life do you 00:03:50.209 want to be a decent version of yourself 00:03:51.680 a pretty good version of yourself a 00:03:54.199 great version of yourself 00:03:55.790 among the best that you could possibly 00:03:57.799 be kind of in that upper threshold or 00:03:59.599 the absolute best that you want to be 00:04:01.190 because if all you want to be is decent 00:04:03.739 at life or being yourself or mastering 00:04:06.739 your craft yeah Josh tells us we have a 00:04:09.169 very high margin for error you can have 00:04:11.120 a bad day or get laid off or whatever 00:04:12.829 and then spend two or three months on 00:04:14.930 the couch okay you get very low 00:04:16.579 standards you can meet them very easily 00:04:18.529 but if you have high standards you need 00:04:21.410 to step your game way up and again the 00:04:23.750 art of learning the art of mastery 00:04:26.180 requires high standards 00:04:28.880 and one of the things I talk about 00:04:31.010 actually don't talk about it in the note 00:04:32.240 but I talk about it in a couple of our 00:04:33.530 classes I rarely go online but I went 00:04:37.010 online to go check out what Josh is up 00:04:39.650 to now I wrote this book a while ago 00:04:41.540 I'm clicking around his website and I 00:04:43.400 see that he offers one-on-one consulting 00:04:45.320 services he's currently booked up but 00:04:48.290 he's got this little application you can 00:04:49.790 fill out but he says very clearly do not 00:04:52.520 apply to work with me unless you're 00:04:55.730 willing to act as if you've just entered 00:04:58.730 a world-champion training camp a 00:05:02.320 world-champion training camp imagine 00:05:04.640 your life as if you were in a world 00:05:07.670 champion training camp your standards 00:05:10.250 are to be the best a world champion yet 00:05:13.910 brings up the energy the intensity of 00:05:16.190 who you are and how you're showing up in 00:05:17.780 the world to an incredible degree that's 00:05:20.660 what's required if we want to master the 00:05:24.200 art of mastery and learning the third 00:05:26.090 idea here is unique you so to go back to 00:05:29.720 that idea think about how your life 00:05:31.400 would change if you just entered a world 00:05:34.970 champion training camp what immediately 00:05:37.640 goes and what gets styled up raise your 00:05:40.820 standards continue to keep your warmth 00:05:43.160 and your self compassion etc high but go 00:05:45.560 out and step up third big idea is unique 00:05:48.700 you so Josh talks about the fact that in 00:05:52.010 his chest career again he was a kid who 00:05:55.220 was ridiculously good playing in the 00:05:56.990 parks of New York City started winning 00:05:58.880 all these tournaments trained with some 00:06:00.620 extraordinary teachers and at a certain 00:06:02.540 point in his adolescence he had two 00:06:05.510 different teachers needed to choose 00:06:07.070 which one to go with and one of them 00:06:10.180 supported Josh's attacking style he 00:06:13.010 tended to be an attacking a bit reckless 00:06:15.860 but just played with a certain style 00:06:19.030 that was intense and attacking and he 00:06:21.650 had a teacher that supported that and 00:06:23.120 then he had a teacher that wanted him to 00:06:25.130 learn basically the exact opposite style 00:06:27.920 a super defensive style of some of the 00:06:29.960 best chess players out there but it was 00:06:32.060 not his style a long story a little 00:06:34.580 shorter he made what he believes in in 00:06:36.770 retrospect to not be the wisest decision 00:06:38.600 which is to go with the guy who 00:06:40.910 basically taught him to 00:06:42.580 go against his natural strengths and in 00:06:46.630 the process he wound up losing the joy 00:06:48.460 and the love he had for chess became a 00:06:50.470 little burned out and wound up quitting 00:06:52.060 chess so he makes the point that we need 00:06:54.670 to get clear on who we are and there 00:06:57.220 will be times we need to modify our kind 00:07:00.070 of take right and be open to feedback 00:07:02.590 and how we can optimize but we want to 00:07:04.840 keep the through line to be consistent 00:07:07.000 with who we are the unique expression of 00:07:09.820 us right so for him it was an attacking 00:07:12.730 chess stop what is it for you who are 00:07:15.370 you when you're expressing yourself most 00:07:17.440 foully we're gonna do a p-n TV soon on 00:07:20.200 Peter Drucker's the effective executive 00:07:22.180 and he makes the exact same point he 00:07:24.850 says you need to make your strengths 00:07:27.400 productive everybody has strengths and 00:07:29.770 everybody has weaknesses there are peaks 00:07:31.360 and there are valleys he says and if you 00:07:33.730 want to be mediocre try to make yourself 00:07:36.670 good at everything it's not gonna happen 00:07:38.620 if you focus on your weaknesses you're 00:07:40.180 gonna become mediocre if you have 00:07:42.010 character issues he says you need to 00:07:43.450 work on them otherwise lean into your 00:07:45.880 strengths so hard that you make your 00:07:48.460 weaknesses irrelevant who are you at 00:07:51.700 your best 00:07:52.810 think about that lean into your unique 00:07:56.140 skills as Tom Rath says one of the 00:07:59.230 world's leading researchers on strengths 00:08:02.170 he says double down in their strengths 00:08:04.750 every single time so what are you great 00:08:07.000 at what can you be great at what do you 00:08:09.490 enjoy doing what do you naturally good 00:08:10.930 at lean in be the unique you the fourth 00:08:14.440 thing here is to invest in loss so when 00:08:17.140 you step up your standards to be the 00:08:18.940 best you need to be comfortable with 00:08:21.880 losing you need to be comfortable with 00:08:23.680 failure you need to and Josh's words 00:08:27.060 invest in a loss and he uses Michael 00:08:30.640 Jordan as an example he says that most 00:08:33.130 people know that Michael Jordan has the 00:08:35.110 most game-winning shots ever he's taken 00:08:39.250 and made the most game-winning shots in 00:08:41.770 the history of the NBA but what most 00:08:44.860 people don't realize is that Johnson Air 00:08:46.960 Jordan also missed more game-winning 00:08:50.320 shots than anyone else in the history of 00:08:52.180 the NBA and he says how do you think he 00:08:54.580 fell on those nights 00:08:56.410 where he missed the game-winning shot 00:08:57.819 and those you know 15 20 thousand people 00:09:00.040 left went home disappointed that Jordan 00:09:03.699 missed the game-winning shot how do you 00:09:05.050 think Jordan felt every night that he 00:09:07.660 missed that game-winning shot he says he 00:09:09.730 felt terrible but he invested in that 00:09:11.319 loss he made living at that edge being 00:09:13.930 committed to being his best self a way 00:09:16.839 of life he invested in that loss he came 00:09:19.420 back from every setback stronger Josh 00:09:22.060 makes the great point that every time he 00:09:23.500 gets injured he shows up the next day 00:09:26.069 and most people said dude take some time 00:09:28.389 off you got to relax right and he's back 00:09:30.370 in there one time he broke his hand he 00:09:32.860 was back in the gym and he needed to 00:09:34.120 train with one hand and in the process 00:09:36.129 he invested in that loss and he learned 00:09:38.620 some moves that later in his career 00:09:40.269 became super super helpful that he 00:09:42.730 wouldn't have learned if you didn't have 00:09:43.720 that loss so the idea is every time you 00:09:45.670 face a setback come back stronger anti 00:09:49.089 fragile style the obstacle is the way 00:09:51.250 invest in loss Phil Stutz my coach says 00:09:55.000 we need to go from failure to failure to 00:09:56.860 failure to failure to failure he says 00:09:59.230 make failure your religion you're 00:10:00.790 willing to invest in the loss get a 00:10:02.769 little bit better each time spiral up 00:10:05.319 through an ante fragile style our fifth 00:10:07.839 big idea here is one of my favorites 00:10:10.089 your best performance needs to become 00:10:14.620 your new baseline an extraordinary thing 00:10:17.680 so imagine that this is your your normal 00:10:20.500 way of going through through life right 00:10:22.750 this is your current baseline then you 00:10:24.639 have this peak experience right you do 00:10:26.949 something that's extraordinary this is 00:10:28.420 your your best right he says you need to 00:10:31.839 figure out what you did to make that 00:10:34.329 moment extraordinary that day 00:10:36.250 extraordinary that move extraordinary 00:10:38.259 for him as he was studying Tai Chi and 00:10:39.850 move your baseline up here so that your 00:10:43.029 new baseline is your prior best this 00:10:47.230 idea is so incredibly inspiring to me as 00:10:49.809 I look at my own creative production I 00:10:51.699 think of well what was my best day as it 00:10:55.089 relates to whatever it is that I'm doing 00:10:56.649 whether it's creating a philosopher's 00:10:58.329 note or one of these or an optimal 00:11:00.850 living class or a plus one or whatever 00:11:02.410 what was my best write and how do I make 00:11:05.620 that best my new baseline so think about 00:11:08.920 you at your best 00:11:10.120 what did you do what did a masterpiece 00:11:12.490 day look like to use our language right 00:11:15.190 what did you at your absolute best look 00:11:17.080 like step back take the time to figure 00:11:19.720 out what you did such that you can make 00:11:22.330 that best your new baseline that's just 00:11:26.020 who you are then guess what there's a 00:11:27.820 new high that you can reach but you 00:11:30.040 can't do that unless you're actually 00:11:31.720 analyzing it 00:11:32.710 Josh talks about the fact that he would 00:11:34.570 videotape all of his sparring sessions 00:11:36.760 and if he made him move that was 00:11:39.670 something he'd never done before he 00:11:41.680 would try to break it down and see what 00:11:43.960 did I do 00:11:44.640 perhaps intuitively or fortuitously that 00:11:47.860 I can wire into just how I show up going 00:11:50.560 forward and the way he describes it as 00:11:52.510 super inspiring but think about that you 00:11:54.880 at your best 00:11:56.170 as your new baseline as you invest in 00:11:59.350 the times when you aren't your best 00:12:00.490 which is another big thing when you're 00:12:02.410 willing to play at this level there are 00:12:04.510 going to be times where you don't look 00:12:05.980 very pretty you need to invest in those 00:12:07.870 times come back stronger and stronger 00:12:09.190 double down in your strengths understand 00:12:11.710 who you are be willing to lean into that 00:12:14.140 unique version of you and then what's 00:12:16.390 your goal do you want to be decent do 00:12:18.550 you want to be good do you want to be 00:12:19.900 great do you want to be among the best 00:12:21.190 or do you want to be the best possible 00:12:22.930 version of you it's a powerful thing 00:12:25.420 world champion

successful people shoot 00:00:02.800 for the stars 00:00:03.760 put their hearts on the line in every 00:00:05.680 battle and ultimately discover 00:00:07.839 that the lessons learned from the 00:00:09.440 pursuit of excellence 00:00:10.960 mean much more than the immediate 00:00:12.880 trophies in glory 00:00:14.320 josh waitzkin few people ever become a 00:00:17.119 national champion at one thing 00:00:19.119 far fewer will do it twice at two 00:00:21.279 completely different skills 00:00:23.119 as a child josh waitskin became a 00:00:25.359 prolific chess player 00:00:26.800 who would go on to become a champion in 00:00:29.199 the push hands martial art 00:00:30.960 known as tai chi chan josh attributes 00:00:33.920 his success 00:00:34.880 in both push hands and later in 00:00:36.640 brazilian jiu jitsu 00:00:38.320 to his ability and skill at learning he 00:00:40.719 had simply cultivated his ability to 00:00:42.960 learn 00:00:43.440 better than others in his book the art 00:00:46.160 of learning 00:00:47.039 josh relates these lessons as he tells 00:00:49.360 the story 00:00:50.640 the first lesson is investment in loss 00:00:54.000 when you first attempt to learn anything 00:00:56.559 you will look silly at times and you 00:00:58.320 will make mistakes 00:00:59.840 it is inevitable josh has many examples 00:01:02.879 of people who progressed slower than him 00:01:05.040 because they were too proud to lose or 00:01:07.280 make mistakes 00:01:08.640 as a kid one of josh's biggest chess 00:01:11.040 rivals wouldn't even play 00:01:12.720 josh he had been praised by all of his 00:01:15.280 friends and family 00:01:16.400 as unbeatable playing josh would risk 00:01:19.200 losing 00:01:19.840 something that he was not willing to do 00:01:22.080 and thus stunted his growth 00:01:24.560 the next lesson we'll cover is to stop 00:01:26.880 repeating mistakes 00:01:28.720 if step one is to be okay making 00:01:30.560 mistakes step two 00:01:32.400 is to not be okay making the same 00:01:34.560 mistakes repeatedly 00:01:36.400 in both martial arts and chess josh 00:01:38.880 tried to find both his 00:01:40.320 and his opponent's errors and learned 00:01:42.399 from both 00:01:43.520 if he lost a queen to a trap he would 00:01:45.600 spend time 00:01:46.640 understanding why he lost the piece for 00:01:49.439 many of us 00:01:50.399 we have habits or patterns that result 00:01:52.479 in the same outcome 00:01:53.600 over and over if you find yourself 00:01:56.159 repeating mistakes 00:01:57.520 you need to analyze what caused them and 00:02:00.000 what you can do to change that behavior 00:02:02.560 paulo coelho author of the alchemist 00:02:05.439 once said 00:02:06.640 and a mistake repeated more than once is 00:02:09.280 a decision 00:02:11.038 next up improvement is a balancing act 00:02:14.239 if you try and dead lift five pounds 00:02:16.239 more than you did last week 00:02:18.000 chances are you'll get stronger if you 00:02:20.400 try to lift a hundred pounds more 00:02:22.000 than you did last week chances are the 00:02:24.319 bar won't move 00:02:25.440 or that you'll hurt yourself as a kid 00:02:28.480 josh often played in adult tournaments 00:02:30.959 so he would be challenged by older 00:02:32.959 more experienced and often better 00:02:35.200 players to learn 00:02:36.800 that being said he still spent plenty of 00:02:39.280 time in study 00:02:40.480 or playing other kids so he wouldn't 00:02:42.720 become completely demoralized 00:02:45.440 josh like many teachers today believes 00:02:48.160 that growth comes 00:02:49.120 outside of your comfort zone you need to 00:02:51.519 push yourself 00:02:52.400 outside the places that you feel safe to 00:02:54.800 learn and grow 00:02:56.480 focusing on the simple is the next idea 00:02:59.280 in one of the notable scenes from the 00:03:01.280 search for bobby fischer which was based 00:03:03.360 on josh's childhood 00:03:05.120 he and his teachers start their chess 00:03:06.879 lesson with just three pieces on the 00:03:09.040 board 00:03:10.239 especially in the attention deficit 00:03:12.480 world that we live in 00:03:13.840 it is easy to become overloaded with 00:03:15.840 details and information 00:03:18.080 learning a new task can seem like 00:03:19.920 staring at an ocean 00:03:21.519 there is so much to learn don't focus on 00:03:24.239 the ocean 00:03:25.120 focus on a single drop of water one that 00:03:28.159 is most important to you 00:03:30.319 now let's look at interval training the 00:03:33.040 fitness community has learned the 00:03:34.560 benefit of high intensity interval 00:03:36.720 training 00:03:37.680 for years now doing hard intense 00:03:40.640 exercise for a short time frame 00:03:42.799 resting a minute or two and then 00:03:44.840 repeating 00:03:46.000 as a kid josh was able to work with some 00:03:48.480 of the leading sports psychologists 00:03:50.640 in top athletic performance centers he 00:03:53.439 noticed that all of these athletes 00:03:55.360 had planned recovery sessions between 00:03:57.439 training 00:03:58.560 he applied this to both his chess game 00:04:01.040 and his practice 00:04:02.720 after 10 minutes of deep thought and 00:04:04.400 focus he would take a quick break 00:04:06.879 and think of something other than chess 00:04:08.879 letting his mind refresh 00:04:11.120 josh applies the same concept to all 00:04:13.280 areas of his life 00:04:15.120 if he is working and loses focus he gets 00:04:17.600 up and takes a short walk 00:04:19.199 if he is meditating and it becomes 00:04:21.040 difficult he might jump up and grab a 00:04:23.280 drink of water before 00:04:24.800 resuming over time you can extend 00:04:28.000 the periods of focus that you apply to 00:04:30.080 work fun 00:04:31.120 meditation and any other area of your 00:04:33.600 life that you 00:04:34.400 choose to apply this to the next lesson 00:04:37.440 is to master the fundamentals josh 00:04:40.000 attributes this lesson 00:04:41.440 as one of the main reasons that he won 00:04:43.440 the push hands world championship 00:04:45.600 just two years after he started in the 00:04:47.600 art all of his competitors knew more 00:04:50.160 than him 00:04:50.960 but what he did know he had a very high 00:04:53.360 level of mastery over 00:04:55.520 you saw this with chess as well working 00:04:58.160 with three pieces 00:04:59.199 before adding complexity allowed him to 00:05:01.759 master peace interactions 00:05:03.360 and movements fundamental mastery and 00:05:06.560 understanding will trump bright shiny 00:05:08.720 objects and flashy 00:05:10.000 tricks it will also allow you to learn 00:05:12.400 the more complex aspects of a topic 00:05:14.639 easier 00:05:15.440 since they are all interrelated bruce 00:05:18.400 lee had a famous quote 00:05:19.759 that perfectly summarized this point i 00:05:22.720 fear not the man who has practiced ten 00:05:24.639 thousand kicks once 00:05:26.479 but i fear the man who has practiced one 00:05:28.479 kick ten thousand times 00:05:30.880 and this leads us right to the next 00:05:32.479 lesson learning as a pyramid 00:05:35.520 if you really really focus on learning 00:05:37.600 and mastering the basics 00:05:39.360 then you will have a strong foundation 00:05:41.039 for learning that topic 00:05:43.039 once you have mastered the basic 00:05:44.720 principle each layer of a skill 00:05:47.039 knowledge and areas you can add on is 00:05:49.759 like adding a layer onto a pyramid 00:05:52.320 the basics also become easier as you add 00:05:55.039 layers 00:05:55.840 you don't have to think about the how as 00:05:57.759 much anymore your body and mind just 00:06:00.080 react 00:06:01.199 a world-class chess player doesn't have 00:06:03.199 to think about how the pieces move 00:06:05.440 piece combinations or space on the board 00:06:08.639 they have internalized these things and 00:06:10.800 so they are natural 00:06:12.240 a skier doesn't think about keeping his 00:06:14.240 knees bent or his tips up 00:06:16.240 he focuses on the details of the terrain 00:06:18.479 around him or her 00:06:20.160 start with the foundation and make sure 00:06:22.319 it's strong 00:06:23.360 then you can build on that now working 00:06:26.400 on your weaknesses 00:06:28.000 we all have weaknesses in work play and 00:06:30.720 learning 00:06:31.280 we all have things that we're good at 00:06:32.960 and we all have things that we're bad at 00:06:35.440 when it comes to competition weakness 00:06:37.360 can be used against you 00:06:39.039 when it comes to learning having a 00:06:41.039 weakness in one area 00:06:42.319 can slow down your progress elsewhere 00:06:44.639 working on weaknesses 00:06:46.000 is never fun but it is extremely 00:06:48.319 important if we are going to succeed 00:06:51.199 and the last lesson match your 00:06:52.880 personality 00:06:54.400 josh had several coaches as he was 00:06:56.319 learning chess the last of these 00:06:58.560 basically blunted his love of the game 00:07:00.880 and led him to quit 00:07:02.479 josh had always played an aggressive 00:07:04.240 attacking style of play 00:07:05.919 this one wanted him to play positionally 00:07:08.479 conservatively 00:07:09.680 and defensively a teacher or coach needs 00:07:12.560 to match your personality 00:07:14.160 and learning style some people need to 00:07:16.479 be pushed 00:07:17.199 yelled at and faced with consequences to 00:07:19.840 learn 00:07:20.240 at their peak others respond better to 00:07:22.880 rewards and praise 00:07:25.039 learning something new isn't easy don't 00:07:27.199 make it harder by forcing yourself to 00:07:29.120 learn from someone 00:07:30.319 who doesn't match your personality type 00:07:33.199 remember 00:07:34.000 in my experience successful people shoot 00:07:36.720 for the stars 00:07:37.840 put their hearts on the line in every 00:07:39.599 battle and ultimately discover that the 00:07:42.160 lessons learned from the pursuit of 00:07:44.000 excellent means much more than the 00:07:46.479 immediate trophies and glory 00:07:48.960 in this book like many of our favorites 00:07:51.680 is part of a story 00:07:52.879 and part lesson josh uses his life as an 00:07:56.080 example for the lessons that he teaches 00:07:58.800 using these principles you can 00:08:00.639 accelerate your learning curve 00:08:02.319 and retain information faster helping 00:08:04.639 you progress 00:08:05.440 in your chosen craft

successful people shoot 00:00:02.800 for the stars 00:00:03.760 put their hearts on the line in every 00:00:05.680 battle and ultimately discover 00:00:07.839 that the lessons learned from the 00:00:09.440 pursuit of excellence 00:00:10.960 mean much more than the immediate 00:00:12.880 trophies in glory 00:00:14.320 josh waitzkin few people ever become a 00:00:17.119 national champion at one thing 00:00:19.119 far fewer will do it twice at two 00:00:21.279 completely different skills 00:00:23.119 as a child josh waitskin became a 00:00:25.359 prolific chess player 00:00:26.800 who would go on to become a champion in 00:00:29.199 the push hands martial art 00:00:30.960 known as tai chi chan josh attributes 00:00:33.920 his success 00:00:34.880 in both push hands and later in 00:00:36.640 brazilian jiu jitsu 00:00:38.320 to his ability and skill at learning he 00:00:40.719 had simply cultivated his ability to 00:00:42.960 learn 00:00:43.440 better than others in his book the art 00:00:46.160 of learning 00:00:47.039 josh relates these lessons as he tells 00:00:49.360 the story 00:00:50.640 the first lesson is investment in loss 00:00:54.000 when you first attempt to learn anything 00:00:56.559 you will look silly at times and you 00:00:58.320 will make mistakes 00:00:59.840 it is inevitable josh has many examples 00:01:02.879 of people who progressed slower than him 00:01:05.040 because they were too proud to lose or 00:01:07.280 make mistakes 00:01:08.640 as a kid one of josh's biggest chess 00:01:11.040 rivals wouldn't even play 00:01:12.720 josh he had been praised by all of his 00:01:15.280 friends and family 00:01:16.400 as unbeatable playing josh would risk 00:01:19.200 losing 00:01:19.840 something that he was not willing to do 00:01:22.080 and thus stunted his growth 00:01:24.560 the next lesson we'll cover is to stop 00:01:26.880 repeating mistakes 00:01:28.720 if step one is to be okay making 00:01:30.560 mistakes step two 00:01:32.400 is to not be okay making the same 00:01:34.560 mistakes repeatedly 00:01:36.400 in both martial arts and chess josh 00:01:38.880 tried to find both his 00:01:40.320 and his opponent's errors and learned 00:01:42.399 from both 00:01:43.520 if he lost a queen to a trap he would 00:01:45.600 spend time 00:01:46.640 understanding why he lost the piece for 00:01:49.439 many of us 00:01:50.399 we have habits or patterns that result 00:01:52.479 in the same outcome 00:01:53.600 over and over if you find yourself 00:01:56.159 repeating mistakes 00:01:57.520 you need to analyze what caused them and 00:02:00.000 what you can do to change that behavior 00:02:02.560 paulo coelho author of the alchemist 00:02:05.439 once said 00:02:06.640 and a mistake repeated more than once is 00:02:09.280 a decision 00:02:11.038 next up improvement is a balancing act 00:02:14.239 if you try and dead lift five pounds 00:02:16.239 more than you did last week 00:02:18.000 chances are you'll get stronger if you 00:02:20.400 try to lift a hundred pounds more 00:02:22.000 than you did last week chances are the 00:02:24.319 bar won't move 00:02:25.440 or that you'll hurt yourself as a kid 00:02:28.480 josh often played in adult tournaments 00:02:30.959 so he would be challenged by older 00:02:32.959 more experienced and often better 00:02:35.200 players to learn 00:02:36.800 that being said he still spent plenty of 00:02:39.280 time in study 00:02:40.480 or playing other kids so he wouldn't 00:02:42.720 become completely demoralized 00:02:45.440 josh like many teachers today believes 00:02:48.160 that growth comes 00:02:49.120 outside of your comfort zone you need to 00:02:51.519 push yourself 00:02:52.400 outside the places that you feel safe to 00:02:54.800 learn and grow 00:02:56.480 focusing on the simple is the next idea 00:02:59.280 in one of the notable scenes from the 00:03:01.280 search for bobby fischer which was based 00:03:03.360 on josh's childhood 00:03:05.120 he and his teachers start their chess 00:03:06.879 lesson with just three pieces on the 00:03:09.040 board 00:03:10.239 especially in the attention deficit 00:03:12.480 world that we live in 00:03:13.840 it is easy to become overloaded with 00:03:15.840 details and information 00:03:18.080 learning a new task can seem like 00:03:19.920 staring at an ocean 00:03:21.519 there is so much to learn don't focus on 00:03:24.239 the ocean 00:03:25.120 focus on a single drop of water one that 00:03:28.159 is most important to you 00:03:30.319 now let's look at interval training the 00:03:33.040 fitness community has learned the 00:03:34.560 benefit of high intensity interval 00:03:36.720 training 00:03:37.680 for years now doing hard intense 00:03:40.640 exercise for a short time frame 00:03:42.799 resting a minute or two and then 00:03:44.840 repeating 00:03:46.000 as a kid josh was able to work with some 00:03:48.480 of the leading sports psychologists 00:03:50.640 in top athletic performance centers he 00:03:53.439 noticed that all of these athletes 00:03:55.360 had planned recovery sessions between 00:03:57.439 training 00:03:58.560 he applied this to both his chess game 00:04:01.040 and his practice 00:04:02.720 after 10 minutes of deep thought and 00:04:04.400 focus he would take a quick break 00:04:06.879 and think of something other than chess 00:04:08.879 letting his mind refresh 00:04:11.120 josh applies the same concept to all 00:04:13.280 areas of his life 00:04:15.120 if he is working and loses focus he gets 00:04:17.600 up and takes a short walk 00:04:19.199 if he is meditating and it becomes 00:04:21.040 difficult he might jump up and grab a 00:04:23.280 drink of water before 00:04:24.800 resuming over time you can extend 00:04:28.000 the periods of focus that you apply to 00:04:30.080 work fun 00:04:31.120 meditation and any other area of your 00:04:33.600 life that you 00:04:34.400 choose to apply this to the next lesson 00:04:37.440 is to master the fundamentals josh 00:04:40.000 attributes this lesson 00:04:41.440 as one of the main reasons that he won 00:04:43.440 the push hands world championship 00:04:45.600 just two years after he started in the 00:04:47.600 art all of his competitors knew more 00:04:50.160 than him 00:04:50.960 but what he did know he had a very high 00:04:53.360 level of mastery over 00:04:55.520 you saw this with chess as well working 00:04:58.160 with three pieces 00:04:59.199 before adding complexity allowed him to 00:05:01.759 master peace interactions 00:05:03.360 and movements fundamental mastery and 00:05:06.560 understanding will trump bright shiny 00:05:08.720 objects and flashy 00:05:10.000 tricks it will also allow you to learn 00:05:12.400 the more complex aspects of a topic 00:05:14.639 easier 00:05:15.440 since they are all interrelated bruce 00:05:18.400 lee had a famous quote 00:05:19.759 that perfectly summarized this point i 00:05:22.720 fear not the man who has practiced ten 00:05:24.639 thousand kicks once 00:05:26.479 but i fear the man who has practiced one 00:05:28.479 kick ten thousand times 00:05:30.880 and this leads us right to the next 00:05:32.479 lesson learning as a pyramid 00:05:35.520 if you really really focus on learning 00:05:37.600 and mastering the basics 00:05:39.360 then you will have a strong foundation 00:05:41.039 for learning that topic 00:05:43.039 once you have mastered the basic 00:05:44.720 principle each layer of a skill 00:05:47.039 knowledge and areas you can add on is 00:05:49.759 like adding a layer onto a pyramid 00:05:52.320 the basics also become easier as you add 00:05:55.039 layers 00:05:55.840 you don't have to think about the how as 00:05:57.759 much anymore your body and mind just 00:06:00.080 react 00:06:01.199 a world-class chess player doesn't have 00:06:03.199 to think about how the pieces move 00:06:05.440 piece combinations or space on the board 00:06:08.639 they have internalized these things and 00:06:10.800 so they are natural 00:06:12.240 a skier doesn't think about keeping his 00:06:14.240 knees bent or his tips up 00:06:16.240 he focuses on the details of the terrain 00:06:18.479 around him or her 00:06:20.160 start with the foundation and make sure 00:06:22.319 it's strong 00:06:23.360 then you can build on that now working 00:06:26.400 on your weaknesses 00:06:28.000 we all have weaknesses in work play and 00:06:30.720 learning 00:06:31.280 we all have things that we're good at 00:06:32.960 and we all have things that we're bad at 00:06:35.440 when it comes to competition weakness 00:06:37.360 can be used against you 00:06:39.039 when it comes to learning having a 00:06:41.039 weakness in one area 00:06:42.319 can slow down your progress elsewhere 00:06:44.639 working on weaknesses 00:06:46.000 is never fun but it is extremely 00:06:48.319 important if we are going to succeed 00:06:51.199 and the last lesson match your 00:06:52.880 personality 00:06:54.400 josh had several coaches as he was 00:06:56.319 learning chess the last of these 00:06:58.560 basically blunted his love of the game 00:07:00.880 and led him to quit 00:07:02.479 josh had always played an aggressive 00:07:04.240 attacking style of play 00:07:05.919 this one wanted him to play positionally 00:07:08.479 conservatively 00:07:09.680 and defensively a teacher or coach needs 00:07:12.560 to match your personality 00:07:14.160 and learning style some people need to 00:07:16.479 be pushed 00:07:17.199 yelled at and faced with consequences to 00:07:19.840 learn 00:07:20.240 at their peak others respond better to 00:07:22.880 rewards and praise 00:07:25.039 learning something new isn't easy don't 00:07:27.199 make it harder by forcing yourself to 00:07:29.120 learn from someone 00:07:30.319 who doesn't match your personality type 00:07:33.199 remember 00:07:34.000 in my experience successful people shoot 00:07:36.720 for the stars 00:07:37.840 put their hearts on the line in every 00:07:39.599 battle and ultimately discover that the 00:07:42.160 lessons learned from the pursuit of 00:07:44.000 excellent means much more than the 00:07:46.479 immediate trophies and glory 00:07:48.960 in this book like many of our favorites 00:07:51.680 is part of a story 00:07:52.879 and part lesson josh uses his life as an 00:07:56.080 example for the lessons that he teaches 00:07:58.800 using these principles you can 00:08:00.639 accelerate your learning curve 00:08:02.319 and retain information faster helping 00:08:04.639 you progress 00:08:05.440 in your chosen craft

fundamentals josh 00:04:40.000 attributes this lesson 00:04:41.440 as one of the main reasons that he won 00:04:43.440 the push hands world championship 00:04:45.600 just two years after he started in the 00:04:47.600 art all of his competitors knew more 00:04:50.160 than him 00:04:50.960 but what he did know he had a very high 00:04:53.360 level of mastery over 00:04:55.520 you saw this with chess as well working 00:04:58.160 with three pieces 00:04:59.199 before adding complexity allowed him to 00:05:01.759 master peace interactions 00:05:03.360 and movements fundamental mastery and 00:05:06.560 understanding will trump bright shiny 00:05:08.720 objects and flashy 00:05:10.000 tricks it will also allow you to learn 00:05:12.400 the more complex aspects of a topic 00:05:14.639 easier 00:05:15.440 since they are all interrelated bruce 00:05:18.400 lee had a famous quote 00:05:19.759 that perfectly summarized this point i 00:05:22.720 fear not the man who has practiced ten

00:05:52.320 the basics also become easier as you add 00:05:55.039 layers 00:05:55.840 you don't have to think about the how as 00:05:57.759 much anymore your body and mind just 00:06:00.080 react 00:06:01.199 a world-class chess player doesn't have 00:06:03.199 to think about how the pieces move 00:06:05.440 piece combinations or space on the board 00:06:08.639 they have internalized these things and 00:06:10.800 so they are natural 00:06:12.240 a skier doesn't think about keeping his 00:06:14.240 knees bent or his tips up 00:06:16.240 he focuses on the details of the terrain 00:06:18.479 around him or her 00:06:20.160 start with the foundation and make sure 00:06:22.319 it's strong 00:06:23.360 then you can build on that now working 00:06:26.400 on your weaknesses

always played an aggressive 00:07:04.240 attacking style of play 00:07:05.919 this one wanted him to play positionally 00:07:08.479 conservatively 00:07:09.680 and defensively a teacher or coach needs

00:00:09.440 pursuit of excellence 00:00:10.960 mean much more than the immediate 00:00:12.880 trophies in glory 00:00:14.320 josh waitzkin few people ever become a 00:00:17.119 national champion at one thing 00:00:19.119 far fewer will do it twice at two 00:00:21.279 completely different skills 00:00:23.119 as a child josh waitskin became a 00:00:25.359 prolific chess player 00:00:26.800 who would go on to become a champion in 00:00:29.199 the push hands martial art 00:00:30.960 known as tai chi chan josh attributes 00:00:33.920 his success 00:00:34.880 in both push hands and later in 00:00:36.640 brazilian jiu jitsu 00:00:38.320 to his ability and skill at learning he 00:00:40.719 had simply cultivated his ability to 00:00:42.960 learn 00:00:43.440 better than others in his book the art 00:00:46.160 of learning 00:00:47.039 josh relates these lessons as he tells 00:00:49.360 the story 00:00:50.640 the first lesson is investment in loss 00:00:54.000 when you first attempt to learn anything 00:00:56.559 you will look silly at times and you 00:00:58.320 will make mistakes 00:00:59.840 it is inevitable josh has many examples 00:01:02.879 of people who progressed slower than him 00:01:05.040 because they were too proud to lose or 00:01:07.280 make mistakes 00:01:08.640 as a kid one of josh's biggest chess 00:01:11.040 rivals wouldn't even play 00:01:12.720 josh he had been praised by all of his 00:01:15.280 friends and family 00:01:16.400 as unbeatable playing josh would risk 00:01:19.200 losing 00:01:19.840 something that he was not willing to do 00:01:22.080 and thus stunted his growth 00:01:24.560 the next lesson we'll cover is to stop 00:01:26.880 repeating mistakes 00:01:28.720 if step one is to be okay making 00:01:30.560 mistakes step two 00:01:32.400 is to not be okay making the same 00:01:34.560 mistakes repeatedly 00:01:36.400 in both martial arts and chess josh 00:01:38.880 tried to find both his 00:01:40.320 and his opponent's errors and learned 00:01:42.399 from both 00:01:43.520 if he lost a queen to a trap he would 00:01:45.600 spend time 00:01:46.640 understanding why he lost the piece for 00:01:49.439 many of us 00:01:50.399 we have habits or patterns that result 00:01:52.479 in the same outcome 00:01:53.600 over and over if you find yourself 00:01:56.159 repeating mistakes 00:01:57.520 you need to analyze what caused them and 00:02:00.000 what you can do to change that behavior 00:02:02.560 paulo coelho author of the alchemist 00:02:05.439 once said 00:02:06.640 and a mistake repeated more than once is 00:02:09.280 a decision 00:02:11.038 next up improvement is a balancing act 00:02:14.239 if you try and dead lift five pounds 00:02:16.239 more than you did last week 00:02:18.000 chances are you'll get stronger if you 00:02:20.400 try to lift a hundred pounds more 00:02:22.000 than you did last week chances are the 00:02:24.319 bar won't move 00:02:25.440 or that you'll hurt yourself as a kid 00:02:28.480 josh often played in adult tournaments 00:02:30.959 so he would be challenged by older 00:02:32.959 more experienced and often better 00:02:35.200 players to learn 00:02:36.800 that being said he still spent plenty of 00:02:39.280 time in study 00:02:40.480 or playing other kids so he wouldn't 00:02:42.720 become completely demoralized 00:02:45.440 josh like many teachers today believes 00:02:48.160 that growth comes 00:02:49.120 outside of your comfort zone you need to 00:02:51.519 push yourself 00:02:52.400 outside the places that you feel safe to 00:02:54.800 learn and grow 00:02:56.480 focusing on the simple is the next idea 00:02:59.280 in one of the notable scenes from the 00:03:01.280 search for bobby fischer which was based 00:03:03.360 on josh's childhood 00:03:05.120 he and his teachers start their chess 00:03:06.879 lesson with just three pieces on the 00:03:09.040 board 00:03:10.239 especially in the attention deficit 00:03:12.480 world that we live in 00:03:13.840 it is easy to become overloaded with 00:03:15.840 details and information 00:03:18.080 learning a new task can seem like 00:03:19.920 staring at an ocean 00:03:21.519 there is so much to learn don't focus on 00:03:24.239 the ocean 00:03:25.120 focus on a single drop of water one that 00:03:28.159 is most important to you 00:03:30.319 now let's look at interval training the 00:03:33.040 fitness community has learned the 00:03:34.560 benefit of high intensity interval 00:03:36.720 training 00:03:37.680 for years now doing hard intense 00:03:40.640 exercise for a short time frame 00:03:42.799 resting a minute or two and then 00:03:44.840 repeating 00:03:46.000 as a kid josh was able to work with some 00:03:48.480 of the leading sports psychologists 00:03:50.640 in top athletic performance centers he 00:03:53.439 noticed that all of these athletes 00:03:55.360 had planned recovery sessions between 00:03:57.439 training 00:03:58.560 he applied this to both his chess game 00:04:01.040 and his practice 00:04:02.720 after 10 minutes of deep thought and 00:04:04.400 focus he would take a quick break 00:04:06.879 and think of something other than chess 00:04:08.879 letting his mind refresh 00:04:11.120 josh applies the same concept to all 00:04:13.280 areas of his life 00:04:15.120 if he is working and loses focus he gets 00:04:17.600 up and takes a short walk 00:04:19.199 if he is meditating and it becomes 00:04:21.040 difficult he might jump up and grab a 00:04:23.280 drink of water before 00:04:24.800 resuming over time you can extend 00:04:28.000 the periods of focus that you apply to 00:04:30.080 work fun 00:04:31.120 meditation and any other area of your 00:04:33.600 life that you 00:04:34.400 choose to apply this to the next lesson 00:04:37.440 is to master the

one thing 00:00:19.119 far fewer will do it twice at two 00:00:21.279 completely different skills 00:00:23.119 as a child josh waitskin became a 00:00:25.359 prolific chess player 00:00:26.800 who would go on to become a champion in 00:00:29.199 the push hands martial art 00:00:30.960 known as tai chi chan josh attributes 00:00:33.920 his success 00:00:34.880 in both push hands and later in 00:00:36.640 brazilian jiu jitsu 00:00:38.320 to his ability and skill at learning he 00:00:40.719 had simply cultivated his ability to 00:00:42.960 learn 00:00:43.440 better than others in his book the art 00:00:46.160 of learning 00:00:47.039 josh relates these lessons as he tells 00:00:49.360 the story 00:00:50.640 the first lesson is investment in loss 00:00:54.000 when you first attempt to learn anything 00:00:56.559 you will look silly at times and you 00:00:58.320 will make mistakes 00:00:59.840 it is inevitable josh has many examples 00:01:02.879 of people who progressed slower than him 00:01:05.040 because they were too proud to lose or 00:01:07.280 make mistakes 00:01:08.640 as a kid one of josh's biggest chess 00:01:11.040 rivals wouldn't even play 00:01:12.720 josh he had been praised by all of his 00:01:15.280 friends and family 00:01:16.400 as unbeatable playing josh would risk 00:01:19.200 losing 00:01:19.840 something that he was not willing to do 00:01:22.080 and thus stunted his growth 00:01:24.560 the next lesson we'll cover is to stop 00:01:26.880 repeating mistakes 00:01:28.720 if step one is to be okay making 00:01:30.560 mistakes step two 00:01:32.400 is to not be okay making the same 00:01:34.560 mistakes repeatedly 00:01:36.400 in both martial arts and chess josh 00:01:38.880 tried to find both his 00:01:40.320 and his opponent's errors and learned 00:01:42.399 from both 00:01:43.520 if he lost a queen to a trap he would 00:01:45.600 spend time 00:01:46.640 understanding why he lost the piece for 00:01:49.439 many of us 00:01:50.399 we have habits or patterns that result 00:01:52.479 in the same outcome 00:01:53.600 over and over if you find yourself 00:01:56.159 repeating mistakes 00:01:57.520 you need to analyze what caused them and 00:02:00.000 what you can do to change that behavior 00:02:02.560 paulo coelho author of the alchemist 00:02:05.439 once said 00:02:06.640 and a mistake repeated more than once is 00:02:09.280 a decision 00:02:11.038 next up improvement is a balancing act 00:02:14.239 if you try and dead lift five pounds 00:02:16.239 more than you did last week 00:02:18.000 chances are you'll get stronger if you 00:02:20.400 try to lift a hundred pounds more 00:02:22.000 than you did last week chances are the 00:02:24.319 bar won't move 00:02:25.440 or that you'll hurt yourself as a kid 00:02:28.480 josh often played in adult tournaments 00:02:30.959 so he would be challenged by older 00:02:32.959 more experienced and often better 00:02:35.200 players to learn 00:02:36.800 that being said he still spent plenty of 00:02:39.280 time in study 00:02:40.480 or playing other kids so he wouldn't 00:02:42.720 become completely demoralized 00:02:45.440 josh like many teachers today believes 00:02:48.160 that growth comes 00:02:49.120 outside of your comfort zone you need to 00:02:51.519 push yourself 00:02:52.400 outside the places that you feel safe to 00:02:54.800 learn and grow 00:02:56.480 focusing on the simple is the next idea 00:02:59.280 in one of the notable scenes from the 00:03:01.280 search for bobby fischer which was based 00:03:03.360 on josh's childhood 00:03:05.120 he and his teachers start their chess 00:03:06.879 lesson with just three pieces on the 00:03:09.040 board 00:03:10.239 especially in the attention deficit 00:03:12.480 world that we live in 00:03:13.840 it is easy to become overloaded with 00:03:15.840 details and information 00:03:18.080 learning a new task can seem like 00:03:19.920 staring at an ocean 00:03:21.519 there is so much to learn don't focus on 00:03:24.239 the ocean 00:03:25.120 focus on a single drop of water one that 00:03:28.159 is most important to you 00:03:30.319 now let's look at interval training the 00:03:33.040 fitness community has learned the 00:03:34.560 benefit of high intensity interval 00:03:36.720 training 00:03:37.680 for years now doing hard intense 00:03:40.640 exercise for a short time frame 00:03:42.799 resting a minute or two and then 00:03:44.840 repeating 00:03:46.000 as a kid josh was able to work with some 00:03:48.480 of the leading sports psychologists 00:03:50.640 in top athletic performance centers he 00:03:53.439 noticed that all of these athletes 00:03:55.360 had planned recovery sessions between 00:03:57.439 training 00:03:58.560 he applied this to both his chess game 00:04:01.040 and his practice 00:04:02.720 after 10 minutes of deep thought and 00:04:04.400 focus he would take a quick break 00:04:06.879 and think of something other than chess 00:04:08.879 letting his mind refresh 00:04:11.120 josh applies the same concept to all 00:04:13.280 areas of his life 00:04:15.120 if he is working and loses focus he gets 00:04:17.600 up and takes a short walk 00:04:19.199 if he is meditating and it becomes 00:04:21.040 difficult he might jump up and grab a 00:04:23.280 drink of water before 00:04:24.800 resuming over time you can extend 00:04:28.000 the periods of focus that you apply to 00:04:30.080 work fun 00:04:31.120 meditation and any other area of your 00:04:33.600 life that you 00:04:34.400 choose to apply this to the next lesson 00:04:37.440 is to master the fundamentals josh 00:04:40.000 attributes this lesson 00:04:41.440 as one of the main reasons that he won 00:04:43.440 the push hands world championship 00:04:45.600 just two years after he started in the 00:04:47.600 art all of his competitors knew more 00:04:50.160 than him 00:04:50.960 but what he did know he had a very high 00:04:53.360 level of mastery over 00:04:55.520 you saw this with chess as well working 00:04:58.160 with three pieces 00:04:59.199 before adding complexity allowed him to 00:05:01.759 master peace interactions 00:05:03.360 and movements fundamental mastery and 00:05:06.560 understanding will trump bright shiny 00:05:08.720 objects and flashy 00:05:10.000 tricks it will also allow you to learn 00:05:12.400 the more complex aspects of a topic 00:05:14.639 easier 00:05:15.440 since they are all interrelated bruce 00:05:18.400 lee had a famous quote 00:05:19.759 that perfectly summarized this point i 00:05:22.720 fear not the man who has practiced ten 00:05:24.639 thousand kicks once 00:05:26.479 but i fear the man who has practiced one 00:05:28.479 kick ten thousand times 00:05:30.880 and this leads us right to the next 00:05:32.479 lesson learning as a pyramid 00:05:35.520 if you really really focus on learning 00:05:37.600 and mastering the basics 00:05:39.360 then you will have a strong foundation 00:05:41.039 for learning that topic 00:05:43.039 once you have mastered the basic 00:05:44.720 principle each layer of a skill 00:05:47.039 knowledge and areas you can add on is 00:05:49.759 like adding a layer onto a pyramid 00:05:52.320 the basics also become easier as you add 00:05:55.039 layers 00:05:55.840 you don't have to think about the how as 00:05:57.759 much anymore your body and mind just 00:06:00.080 react 00:06:01.199 a world-class chess player doesn't have 00:06:03.199 to think about how the pieces move 00:06:05.440 piece combinations or space on the board 00:06:08.639 they have internalized these things and 00:06:10.800 so they are natural 00:06:12.240 a skier doesn't think about keeping his 00:06:14.240 knees bent or his tips up 00:06:16.240 he focuses on the details of the terrain 00:06:18.479 around him or her 00:06:20.160 start with the foundation and make sure 00:06:22.319 it's strong 00:06:23.360 then you can build on that now working 00:06:26.400 on your weaknesses 00:06:28.000 we all have weaknesses in work play and 00:06:30.720 learning 00:06:31.280 we all have things that we're good at 00:06:32.960 and we all have things that we're bad at 00:06:35.440 when it comes to competition weakness 00:06:37.360 can be used against you 00:06:39.039 when it comes to learning having a 00:06:41.039 weakness in one area 00:06:42.319 can slow down your progress elsewhere 00:06:44.639 working on weaknesses 00:06:46.000 is never fun but it is extremely 00:06:48.319 important if we are going to succeed 00:06:51.199 and the last lesson match your 00:06:52.880 personality 00:06:54.400 josh had several coaches as he was 00:06:56.319 learning chess the last of these 00:06:58.560 basically blunted his love of the game 00:07:00.880 and led him to quit 00:07:02.479 josh had always played an aggressive 00:07:04.240 attacking style of play 00:07:05.919 this one wanted him to play positionally 00:07:08.479 conservatively 00:07:09.680 and defensively a teacher or coach needs 00:07:12.560 to match your personality 00:07:14.160 and learning style some people need to 00:07:16.479 be pushed 00:07:17.199 yelled at and faced with consequences to 00:07:19.840 learn 00:07:20.240 at their peak others respond better to 00:07:22.880 rewards and praise 00:07:25.039 learning something new isn't easy don't 00:07:27.199 make it harder by forcing yourself to 00:07:29.120 learn from someone 00:07:30.319 who doesn't match your personality type 00:07:33.199 remember 00:07:34.000 in my experience successful people shoot 00:07:36.720 for the stars 00:07:37.840 put their hearts on the line in every 00:07:39.599 battle and ultimately discover that the 00:07:42.160 lessons learned from the pursuit of 00:07:44.000 excellent means much more than the 00:07:46.479 immediate trophies and glory 00:07:48.960 in this book like many of our favorites 00:07:51.680 is part of a story 00:07:52.879 and part lesson josh uses his life as an 00:07:56.080 example for the lessons that he teaches 00:07:58.800 using these principles you can 00:08:00.639 accelerate your learning curve 00:08:02.319 and retain information faster helping 00:08:04.639 you progress 00:08:05.440 in your chosen craft

00:05:06.560 understanding will trump bright shiny 00:05:08.720 objects and flashy 00:05:10.000 tricks it will also allow you to learn 00:05:12.400 the more complex aspects of a topic 00:05:14.639 easier 00:05:15.440 since they are all interrelated bruce 00:05:18.400 lee had a famous quote 00:05:19.759 that perfectly summarized this point i 00:05:22.720 fear not the man who has practiced ten 00:05:24.639 thousand kicks once 00:05:26.479 but i fear the man who has practiced one 00:05:28.479 kick ten thousand times 00:05:30.880 and this leads us right to the next 00:05:32.479 lesson learning as a pyramid 00:05:35.520 if you really really focus on learning 00:05:37.600 and mastering the basics 00:05:39.360 then you will have a strong foundation 00:05:41.039 for learning that topic 00:05:43.039 once you have mastered the basic 00:05:44.720 principle each layer of a skill 00:05:47.039 knowledge and areas you can add on is 00:05:49.759 like adding a layer onto a pyramid 00:05:52.320 the basics also become easier as you add 00:05:55.039 layers 00:05:55.840 you don't have to think about the how as 00:05:57.759 much anymore your body and mind just 00:06:00.080 react 00:06:01.199 a world-class chess player doesn't have 00:06:03.199 to think about how the pieces move 00:06:05.440 piece combinations or space on the board 00:06:08.639 they have internalized these things and 00:06:10.800 so they are natural 00:06:12.240 a skier doesn't think about keeping his 00:06:14.240 knees bent or his tips up 00:06:16.240 he focuses on the details of the terrain 00:06:18.479 around him or her 00:06:20.160 start with the foundation and make sure 00:06:22.319 it's strong 00:06:23.360 then you can build on that now working 00:06:26.400 on your weaknesses 00:06:28.000 we all have weaknesses in work play and 00:06:30.720 learning 00:06:31.280 we all have things that we're good at 00:06:32.960 and we all have things that we're bad at 00:06:35.440 when it comes to competition weakness 00:06:37.360 can be used against you 00:06:39.039 when it comes to learning having a 00:06:41.039 weakness in one area 00:06:42.319 can slow down your progress elsewhere 00:06:44.639 working on weaknesses 00:06:46.000 is never fun but it is extremely 00:06:48.319 important if we are going to succeed 00:06:51.199 and the last lesson match your 00:06:52.880 personality 00:06:54.400 josh had several coaches as he was 00:06:56.319 learning chess the last of these 00:06:58.560 basically blunted his love of the game 00:07:00.880 and led him to quit 00:07:02.479 josh had always played an aggressive 00:07:04.240 attacking style of play 00:07:05.919 this one wanted him to play positionally 00:07:08.479 conservatively 00:07:09.680 and defensively a teacher or coach needs 00:07:12.560 to match your personality 00:07:14.160 and learning style some people need to 00:07:16.479 be pushed 00:07:17.199 yelled at and faced with consequences to 00:07:19.840 learn 00:07:20.240 at their peak others respond better to 00:07:22.880 rewards and praise 00:07:25.039 learning something new isn't easy don't 00:07:27.199 make it harder by forcing yourself to 00:07:29.120 learn from someone 00:07:30.319 who doesn't match your personality type 00:07:33.199 remember 00:07:34.000 in my experience successful people shoot 00:07:36.720 for the stars 00:07:37.840 put their hearts on the line in every 00:07:39.599 battle and ultimately discover that the 00:07:42.160 lessons learned from the pursuit of 00:07:44.000 excellent means much more than the 00:07:46.479 immediate trophies and glory 00:07:48.960 in this book like many of our favorites 00:07:51.680 is part of a story 00:07:52.879 and part lesson josh uses his life as an 00:07:56.080 example for the lessons that he teaches 00:07:58.800 using these principles you can 00:08:00.639 accelerate your learning curve 00:08:02.319 and retain information faster helping 00:08:04.639 you progress 00:08:05.440 in your chosen craft

00:00:20.039 thank you thank you so much it's very 00:00:23.430 nice to be here I have to say though you 00:00:24.960 know I thought this was just a 00:00:25.859 phenomenon in the States that when 00:00:27.150 people come to a talk they create this 00:00:28.590 demilitarized zone between the speaker 00:00:30.390 and the audience but so I'm a leap up 00:00:32.610 there and a little while and talk to you 00:00:33.780 I I was told bobbing and for me that 00:00:37.199 this will be a very diverse audience so 00:00:38.970 I understand there are people in here 00:00:39.989 who are teachers and performers and 00:00:42.360 psychologists and are just an array of 00:00:44.370 people so I will try to gear this in a 00:00:46.530 way that everyone is interested at some 00:00:48.570 point in time I want to see a little 00:00:51.600 about myself before I start talking 00:00:53.550 about the topics I'm talking about today 00:00:54.809 because it sort of explains how I ended 00:00:58.109 up doing what I'm doing 00:01:00.329 my my dad was 50 years old when I was 00:01:03.270 born and he was convinced that I was 00:01:06.930 gonna be very successful in life which 00:01:09.330 for my dad who was born in nineteen five 00:01:11.630 that meant making a lot of money so he 00:01:15.179 was sure I was going to be an attorney 00:01:17.310 and actually I applied when I was in 00:01:19.350 high school to go to college I got a 00:01:20.640 scholarship to study pre-law at a very 00:01:22.170 prominent school everyone's very happy 00:01:23.970 about that and about an April of my 00:01:26.610 senior year in high school I was having 00:01:28.380 dinner with my parents and I know where 00:01:29.640 they were sitting I can see the 00:01:30.630 tablecloth I even know what we were 00:01:31.800 eating 00:01:32.130 and I looked up my courage and I said 00:01:35.130 dad I don't think I want to be a lawyer 00:01:36.569 and my dad kind of perked up cuz he's 00:01:39.149 thinking surgeon you know and he said 00:01:42.989 well what do you want to do I said well 00:01:44.280 I think I want to be a music teacher 00:01:46.640 there was a long pause and we passed 00:01:49.530 vegetables for a long time and and then 00:01:51.539 my father asked the question that he 00:01:52.739 would ask he said well Bob what the 00:01:54.539 music teachers make and this will date 00:01:57.750 me a little bit but at the time I said I 00:01:59.160 said they'd make eight thousand dollars 00:02:00.810 a year which when you're 17 years old 00:02:03.330 that's a fortune how could even spend 00:02:04.920 eight thousand dollars a year I thought 00:02:06.060 it was the greatest thing in the world 00:02:06.929 and I I spent the next several years 00:02:11.209 convincing my father that I hadn't made 00:02:13.319 a mistake because I love music I love to 00:02:16.080 play I love to sing and I love to teach 00:02:18.920 and that was my first job I ended up I 00:02:22.349 was in a very fortunate place in Atlanta 00:02:24.090 where I taught high school orchestra and 00:02:26.040 band and played drums and recording 00:02:28.170 studios it was a perfect balance in my 00:02:31.650 life but what I found was I was so 00:02:33.790 curious about the way learning worked 00:02:36.519 not only my own learning as a musician 00:02:39.010 but my students learning and I found 00:02:41.530 that my focus of attention really wasn't 00:02:43.090 on what I was doing to them and with 00:02:45.760 them but I was most interested in what 00:02:48.010 was going on in their minds that led to 00:02:50.439 their understanding or not understanding 00:02:53.019 or being able to do something I was 00:02:54.819 trying to get them to do or not being 00:02:55.870 able to do it and those kinds of 00:02:57.579 questions made teaching a very 00:02:59.140 interesting enterprise for me when I 00:03:02.530 finished my degree and started teaching 00:03:03.790 in a university one of the things that I 00:03:05.230 quickly realized is that many teacher 00:03:07.239 preparation programs now looking at it 00:03:08.950 from a different perspective we're 00:03:10.659 mostly about how to teach and by that I 00:03:13.930 mean what teachers should do too and 00:03:16.299 with students what it what they weren't 00:03:19.269 this bad about as much was how learners 00:03:21.700 learn which is ever more interesting and 00:03:25.389 ever more important if you're going to 00:03:27.639 be an effective teacher teaching a wide 00:03:29.290 diversity of learners there are a lot of 00:03:32.139 prescriptive things that happen in 00:03:33.579 education and in the United States now 00:03:35.950 much of learning in schools not just in 00:03:38.409 music but in all disciplines is becoming 00:03:39.819 even more highly personal prescriptive 00:03:41.500 as we're preparing people to do well on 00:03:43.150 standardized tests but the think is 00:03:45.400 interesting about that is it doesn't 00:03:46.690 really acknowledge the fact that 00:03:48.220 learners come to every experience with a 00:03:51.129 history and that history predicts what 00:03:53.949 they're going to do when they respond to 00:03:55.510 certain problems that we put before them 00:03:57.220 in certain tests that we ask them to do 00:03:58.720 and understanding that to me makes the 00:04:01.209 whole enterprise of teaching a much more 00:04:03.040 interesting and compelling one than just 00:04:05.379 sort of going through the nine steps of 00:04:06.669 the clarinet embouchure to get somebody 00:04:07.989 to do a particular thing so that's what 00:04:09.669 I want to talk about today before I talk 00:04:12.430 any more since this is a music school 00:04:14.260 I'm gonna play a little music this video 00:04:16.180 is about two minutes and 20 seconds long 00:04:17.889 you can adjust your attention spans 00:04:19.329 accordingly many of you have probably 00:04:21.519 seen this because it has now 63 million 00:04:23.620 hits on YouTube but I'll just let it 00:04:24.970 play and then we'll talk Everett silver 00:04:26.320 I have to make sure I turn on my clicker 00:04:29.800 though 00:06:08.470 yeah I would say how I find out about 00:06:10.610 this video one of my daughter Susan sent 00:06:12.020 me a link to this and email said you got 00:06:14.150 to see this video somebody locked a kid 00:06:15.230 in a closet with a ukelele what it look 00:06:17.720 like is in a closet doesn't it yeah it's 00:06:23.180 an interesting thing to watch this kid 00:06:24.800 play and I went and did a little 00:06:26.840 research and find out who this kid is 00:06:28.160 and how he learned to play the ukulele 00:06:29.270 actually he lives in Japan and his 00:06:32.270 father discovered that Japanese 00:06:33.590 television was going to be playing a 00:06:34.850 series of ukulele lessons for three 00:06:36.440 months and he went out and bought two 00:06:38.210 ukuleles one for himself and one for his 00:06:39.800 son and together watching television 00:06:40.940 they've learned to play the ukuleles 00:06:42.050 together and this is the result now if I 00:06:45.200 were gonna adjudicate that performance 00:06:48.530 there are many flaws in what that job is 00:06:51.140 doing all of his strings don't vibrate 00:06:53.360 with a clear tone he loses tempo and the 00:06:56.810 stop course when he's scratching his 00:06:58.370 nose and there's no way the words he's 00:07:01.070 Japanese he's just making sounds that 00:07:02.330 sound like English words and there's a 00:07:04.700 lot wrong with that 00:07:05.420 but I would argue to exhaustion with 00:07:07.940 anyone who want to convince me that kid 00:07:09.320 doesn't understand what music is for and 00:07:11.530 what I mean by that is conveying 00:07:14.690 something to other human beings now 00:07:17.060 that's an important thing to think about 00:07:19.180 primarily because in school one would 00:07:22.520 think that's the focus of attention when 00:07:25.070 people are teaching people about music 00:07:26.540 but often that's not the focus of 00:07:28.310 attention people are thinking about 00:07:29.270 music and one of the reasons that I play 00:07:32.090 this video not only because I just 00:07:34.100 lights me but but also because it makes 00:07:36.950 the case of how effective even very 00:07:40.160 young people who have very little 00:07:41.750 experience can express things to other 00:07:44.240 human beings and this is not something 00:07:46.010 that I mean obviously this kid is a very 00:07:47.600 capable kid and he's very good at what 00:07:49.670 he does but most kids who come to school 00:07:52.370 in whatever discipline are much more 00:07:54.920 capable then school gives them credit 00:07:57.050 for being I mean everybody who comes to 00:07:59.210 am used to a new music experience as a 00:08:01.250 learner has listened to countless hours 00:08:04.160 of music since they were in utero right 00:08:07.820 they've been listening to music and 00:08:09.110 they've been developing understandings 00:08:10.550 about the way music and their culture 00:08:12.200 works and yet we often bring them to 00:08:14.810 school and we put them in what's called 00:08:17.120 beginning music instruction right sort 00:08:20.150 of ignoring the fact that they're not 00:08:22.190 beginning listeners right they have a 00:08:24.650 lot of understanding about music that's 00:08:26.630 not a part of our planning for 00:08:29.180 instruction now the things that shame to 00:08:31.490 me about this is this is not unique to 00:08:33.530 music making I give a lot of talks for 00:08:36.110 audiences in other disciplines and what 00:08:38.990 I what I find is often the things that 00:08:41.360 exist outside of school that is the 00:08:43.490 reasons people make music the reason 00:08:45.290 people do experiments the reason people 00:08:47.090 write whatever it happens to be are 00:08:49.100 often not present in the learning 00:08:51.170 experiences in school and one of the 00:08:54.020 reasons that I think is is such an 00:08:54.980 important thing to think about in any 00:08:56.480 domain is that what we'd like to imagine 00:09:00.080 is that at every point in learning to do 00:09:02.720 whatever the skill happens 00:09:03.720 to be the the main reason for doing it 00:09:07.620 is at the forefront of learners thinking 00:09:09.959 right but that's often not what we find 00:09:13.139 when we watch children in school and all 00:09:14.699 of you have taken courses as 00:09:15.899 undergraduates in you know fill in the 00:09:18.089 blank for non-music majors and left 00:09:21.000 those courses thinking why in the world 00:09:23.189 would anybody be teaching this you know 00:09:25.470 I don't know what your least favorite 00:09:27.509 learning experience was in your history 00:09:29.670 mine was a seventh grade geography class 00:09:32.269 which I still remember not fondly and 00:09:35.540 what I didn't like about the class so 00:09:37.769 much is that I really didn't learn 00:09:38.879 anything that was very interesting we 00:09:40.470 were studying for this big thick book 00:09:41.550 that had geography and big letters 00:09:43.350 across the cover and this nice old 00:09:46.199 gentle man who was teaching this course 00:09:48.360 would kind of drag us through this 00:09:49.800 subject matter and what I was learning 00:09:51.209 was the principal exports of Chile and 00:09:53.519 the altitude of Mount Everest and how 00:09:54.870 many cattle that were on the cattle 00:09:55.980 ranches in Florida and that was 00:09:57.930 geography and I made it through that 00:10:00.360 class it was a happy thing I left 00:10:01.800 geography behind and when I was a 00:10:04.350 freshman and I went to college I went to 00:10:07.529 a freshman mixer thing where we were 00:10:09.240 meeting up with various people who were 00:10:11.189 from other majors and everything and 00:10:12.420 we're sort of little nametags on and 00:10:14.040 we're kind of drinking punch in the gym 00:10:15.660 or wherever it was and I'm talking to 00:10:17.430 this guy he seems really interesting and 00:10:18.839 I'm having a good time talking to him 00:10:19.980 and I look down on his nametag and the 00:10:22.319 guy's a geography major and I thought to 00:10:25.439 myself good God who so misadvised you 00:10:29.009 into this subject that is just the 00:10:30.779 reffed of anything interesting you know 00:10:32.519 this is a drop-in and Korean maybe it's 00:10:33.809 not too late you could change your major 00:10:34.829 and of course the more I talk to him the 00:10:36.839 more I realized I didn't understand 00:10:38.459 anything 00:10:39.180 about what geographers did in geography 00:10:42.540 because again what I knew about 00:10:44.040 geography was a principal exports of 00:10:46.170 Chile and the altitude of Mount Everest 00:10:47.399 and so on right and so as he was telling 00:10:50.100 me about this I realized that my 00:10:51.449 experiences in school in that subject 00:10:53.100 matter were totally unlike experiences 00:10:55.170 outside of school and I would suggest to 00:10:57.000 you that in music that's also the case 00:10:58.920 that experiences that we create in 00:11:01.170 school for learners in music are so 00:11:04.050 utterly unlike the experiences that 00:11:06.480 people have outside of school that it's 00:11:08.910 not surprising then that many learners 00:11:10.860 who come into school thinking they're 00:11:12.480 going to do music end up feeling not 00:11:14.490 very capable and not very interested in 00:11:16.529 pursuing what 00:11:17.220 we think is a very wonderful thing to 00:11:19.170 pursue um I have a friend of mine in the 00:11:23.790 neuroscience department Texas who said 00:11:25.259 if you ever put a slide up in a talk 00:11:27.209 with a picture of brain on it people 00:11:29.100 remember 30% more of your talk and if 00:11:30.870 you didn't do that I really think he 00:11:32.279 just made that up but but I I figured 00:11:34.560 you but but the reason I put that there 00:11:37.439 I really give a reason for that is is 00:11:39.480 that when you imagine what we're doing 00:11:41.970 when we're creating learning experiences 00:11:44.339 I mean I would imagine that most of you 00:11:46.920 if not all of you in this room realize 00:11:48.509 that what we're trying to do is actually 00:11:49.470 change that thing but I want to suggest 00:11:51.810 you that many teachers conceptions of 00:11:53.610 human memory are mistaken and many of 00:11:57.540 you know that up into the middle last 00:11:58.620 century many people's perceptions and 00:12:01.230 this still persists in many teachers 00:12:02.639 perceptions is that brains are like tape 00:12:05.639 recorders or like flash drives on 00:12:07.589 computers and when we're experiencing 00:12:09.180 something like all of you experience 00:12:10.410 something right now stuffs get written 00:12:12.269 on the tape and tomorrow you'll wake up 00:12:14.670 and you think well wonder what happened 00:12:15.689 to that lecture at 4:30 yesterday you 00:12:17.129 rewind that tape to 4:30 and there's a 00:12:18.689 lecture and of course that's not at all 00:12:20.009 the case as many of you well know 00:12:21.959 but the interesting thing about this is 00:12:23.670 much of the learning experience that we 00:12:25.500 create for learners are predicated on 00:12:28.079 that very idea and you know one example 00:12:30.779 of it is what we're doing right now 00:12:32.399 right I mean most is 00:12:36.259 institutions of learning have rooms all 00:12:38.790 over their campuses just like this with 00:12:40.920 chairs bolted to the floor paint facing 00:12:43.829 somebody talking to you and this is a 00:12:46.559 terrible learning environment and I can 00:12:48.959 promise you now that they've already cut 00:12:50.309 my check in the next hour none of you is 00:12:52.800 gonna learn a damn thing from me right 00:12:54.660 and the reason is you're not busy enough 00:12:57.029 to be learning something right if any 00:12:59.670 learning will take place it won't happen 00:13:01.350 in the room the learning will take place 00:13:03.120 after you leave this room and if you 00:13:04.529 happen to recall something that went on 00:13:06.089 in this room and try to apply it in some 00:13:08.490 way to something you're doing in the 00:13:09.569 moment that's when the learning will 00:13:10.980 start but this isn't the learning part 00:13:12.720 right this is just listening to some guy 00:13:14.550 talk right now the reason that's 00:13:17.040 important to think about from a learning 00:13:19.170 perspective is it challenges teachers 00:13:22.439 institutions whatever the person is the 00:13:26.370 parents whomever right to say what's 00:13:28.829 really required to make 00:13:30.590 that different because as again many of 00:13:33.440 you know when when organic brains form 00:13:36.320 memories it's not like putting something 00:13:38.000 on a flash drive when you work at your 00:13:39.380 computer you hit the save command your 00:13:41.150 computer looks to a blank space on the 00:13:42.410 drive it writes whatever you're trying 00:13:44.060 to save to the drive and binary switches 00:13:46.130 flip from one zero and zero to one in 00:13:47.900 some configuration that represents what 00:13:49.370 you save what's already on the drive has 00:13:51.500 no effect whatever are what you saved 00:13:53.120 right whatever you put on the drive 00:13:54.680 subsequent to the thing you save doesn't 00:13:56.120 any affect on what you say and organic 00:13:58.850 brains don't work anything like that all 00:14:01.010 right I mean all of you who are in the 00:14:02.360 room right now or experiencing now 00:14:04.450 differently from the person sitting next 00:14:06.200 to you not just because you have a 00:14:07.670 different visual perspective or a 00:14:08.870 different auditory perspective but 00:14:10.550 because you came into the room with 00:14:11.660 different experiences and after this is 00:14:14.030 over what happens subsequent to this our 00:14:16.060 will change what you remember about this 00:14:18.710 our so this is a tremendously dynamic 00:14:20.600 thing except much of what's happens when 00:14:23.210 we create experiences in school they 00:14:25.670 also acknowledge that very reality about 00:14:27.920 people um I'll show you another picture 00:14:31.130 it's sort of interesting and many of you 00:14:32.780 probably seen this too this is I stole 00:14:34.040 this off the web of the human connectome 00:14:35.690 project and of course this is a picture 00:14:38.390 of the pathways of axons in brain and 00:14:41.840 and of course the the real issue about 00:14:43.670 what happens when brains learn is not 00:14:46.280 where memories get put but are they 00:14:48.770 connected in advantageous ways that 00:14:50.660 makes them advantageous lee retrievable 00:14:52.160 in the future so when I talk to teachers 00:14:55.070 and I talk to people who are musicians 00:14:56.780 who are trying to learn about teaching 00:14:59.030 more effectively and learning more 00:15:00.530 effectively one of the things that has 00:15:02.450 to change is their conception of memory 00:15:05.180 as something that's unitary that gets 00:15:07.010 put in a place that then you recall at 00:15:09.500 some later point in time 00:15:11.060 and that's so well fixed in schools and 00:15:13.820 it's so well fixed even in music 00:15:15.380 learning that often it fails to 00:15:17.870 advantage students who could actually 00:15:19.520 learn more than we think they're capable 00:15:21.440 of based on what their behavior is in 00:15:23.270 the circumstances we provide for them 00:15:24.970 I'm show you a little video clip of 00:15:27.740 something that the University Texas used 00:15:29.420 to play you know we have a huge football 00:15:31.910 program at Texas and all Division one 00:15:34.100 schools have little 10-15 second clips 00:15:36.770 that we play during television 00:15:38.930 appearances of our team to show how cool 00:15:41.270 the team is and so I'm going to play a 00:15:43.010 little 00:15:43.840 used to play about 15 years ago we don't 00:15:52.960 claim to be able to change the world 00:15:59.550 just change people and then they changed 00:16:05.880 the 00:16:13.310 weird Texas yeah what who didn't want to 00:16:17.880 go to school there 00:16:18.540 I mean Walter Cronkite's voice got steel 00:16:21.000 guitar at breakfast tacos it's fantastic 00:16:23.510 now I love the audacity of that I mean 00:16:26.970 which is sort of is emblematic of the 00:16:29.460 way Texans feel about themselves you 00:16:30.930 know we're Texas we just we just changed 00:16:32.370 people and when that video was playing 00:16:35.010 which is now 12 to 15 years ago the then 00:16:37.200 provost and then president whenever I'd 00:16:38.910 find myself at a gathering with them I 00:16:40.860 you know I I go to so you know that ad 00:16:42.420 we're playing on television we just 00:16:43.680 changed people how do we know that and 00:16:47.490 of course they're the real answer is we 00:16:49.650 don't have any idea and how do we know 00:16:52.230 we're actually changing them the way 00:16:53.190 we're intending to change them well we 00:16:54.780 don't me idea about that either 00:16:55.830 right because we bring people in the 00:16:57.900 rooms and we do stuff to them and with 00:16:59.640 them and send them on their way with the 00:17:01.050 expectation that they've been changed in 00:17:02.700 some way that we've intended wouldn't 00:17:04.650 it's often not the case so that raises 00:17:09.089 the question what we do about that and 00:17:11.099 it has to start I think with this now 00:17:14.130 I'm thinking about this particular tube 00:17:15.390 music my my favorite phrase that I think 00:17:18.359 I composed is is this one at the top 00:17:20.459 that any learning experience whatever it 00:17:22.740 happens to be needs to begin with a 00:17:24.930 vivid vision of students as accomplished 00:17:28.290 learners and in this case has 00:17:29.400 accomplished musicians and what I'm 00:17:30.990 thinking about in this is once we're 00:17:33.120 finished with learners and they're 00:17:34.560 finished with us what do we want them to 00:17:36.120 be like now I carefully and I don't want 00:17:41.250 I'm not using the phrase it happens in a 00:17:43.590 lot of curricula this is where we want 00:17:45.390 them to know and be able to do but what 00:17:47.940 do we want it to be like and the reason 00:17:50.070 I describe it that way is that being 00:17:51.750 competent in any discipline has not only 00:17:54.860 intellectual components and physical 00:17:57.030 kimonos perhaps but it has an 00:17:58.890 attitudinal component as well - right 00:18:00.900 I mean being successful as a musician as 00:18:04.350 a bench scientist as a writer requires 00:18:07.380 not only knowing things and being able 00:18:09.450 to do things but having a productive 00:18:11.280 attitude in that discipline if you 00:18:13.140 aspire to be a bench scientist at any 00:18:14.730 time you set up an experiment it doesn't 00:18:16.140 work you want to start throwing stuff 00:18:17.520 across the room you're not going to be 00:18:19.020 very successful bench scientists right 00:18:20.400 because most experiments don't work 00:18:22.680 so there's an attitude part to this 00:18:25.140 that's required as well and I had the 00:18:27.510 great privilege which many of you did to 00:18:29.550 some of you did not 00:18:30.540 previous to my talk tonight we had a 00:18:32.850 wonderful workshop where I learned a 00:18:34.470 great deal from colleagues who have done 00:18:35.820 just really remarkable research and one 00:18:38.340 of these we were talking about during 00:18:39.360 those discussions right is this issue of 00:18:42.770 setting up people attitudinally to be 00:18:46.350 effective learners which requires 00:18:48.600 something other than what often happens 00:18:50.490 in school now we're think back to the 00:18:53.010 kid playing a ukulele again because one 00:18:56.040 of the things that impresses me so much 00:18:57.270 about his performance is the X facility 00:18:59.640 and what he's doing right and I thought 00:19:02.880 about when you look at great musicians 00:19:04.710 being great musicians what is the stuff 00:19:06.930 that they're actually doing when they're 00:19:08.430 being great musicians and I wrote it 00:19:09.990 down 00:19:10.140 and that's the whole list now what's 00:19:12.630 remarkable to me is how few things are 00:19:14.460 on that slide right and with the 00:19:16.980 exception of tone production which does 00:19:19.830 require a little development of muscular 00:19:22.380 control and coordination and sometimes 00:19:24.270 strength in some cases none of those 00:19:26.160 things is even very hard right the hard 00:19:29.130 thing about all of that is doing all 00:19:30.480 those things at the same time right and 00:19:33.290 all of this is directed toward making 00:19:36.810 this thing happen now I want to relate 00:19:40.590 this idea to what I was saying a moment 00:19:42.180 ago about how music experiences in 00:19:44.760 school are often unlike what happens 00:19:47.280 outside of school and not just in music 00:19:48.540 in the sciences as well I've been 00:19:51.120 working on a grant that's funded by 00:19:52.380 National Science Foundation for a number 00:19:53.580 of years where we have a group of PhD 00:19:56.820 students who are given fellowships to be 00:19:58.350 scientists for a day in residence in 00:20:01.740 school for a whole semester so these 00:20:04.980 students go into schools every Friday 00:20:06.720 whatever happens to be they talk to 00:20:09.720 students about their own research they 00:20:10.920 help students set up their research it's 00:20:12.390 a really wonderful program and I'm 00:20:13.860 privileged to be a part of it a number 00:20:16.500 of years ago when we first started this 00:20:17.490 program and we wouldn't know we were 00:20:18.480 doing it didn't know how best to set 00:20:19.650 this up it was a very bright woman in my 00:20:21.750 class who was asked by her teacher to do 00:20:24.540 a lesson on friction and she was a 00:20:26.430 geophysicist and she said okay and 00:20:29.070 rather than designing her own lesson 00:20:30.810 plan the teacher sort of gave her this 00:20:31.920 lesson plan about friction and in the 00:20:35.340 Austin School District 00:20:36.289 you can actually rent a set of friction 00:20:38.970 kits unfortunately and basically what 00:20:41.190 the kits are for schools is their 50 00:20:42.929 centimeter boards that have foam on one 00:20:44.519 side and smooth wood on the other side 00:20:45.960 and a bunch of really heavy metal 00:20:47.100 washers and digital stopwatches and what 00:20:50.220 this teacher had done was set up these 00:20:51.480 boards and all the kids make incline 00:20:53.759 planes and they're supposed to slide 00:20:55.710 these washers down the boards in time 00:20:57.149 how fast the washers go on the foam side 00:20:59.340 and the wood side and you know where 00:21:01.919 this is going this is a seventh grade 00:21:02.940 class right so that's so my nice student 00:21:04.740 who's doing this in there videotaping 00:21:05.759 this whole presentation says we're gonna 00:21:08.519 talk about friction today so if you were 00:21:11.190 pushing a 50-pound block of cement and 00:21:13.409 you had to push it a hundred yards would 00:21:16.649 you rather push it across a football 00:21:18.720 field or an ice-skating rink 00:21:21.289 your seventh graders right they say ice 00:21:23.580 skating rink and I saw her look on her 00:21:25.740 face of the videotape she kind of went 00:21:26.850 action like but you already know that 00:21:27.720 we're doing friction snaps was to teach 00:21:28.980 her that so anyway they knew that 00:21:30.480 already she goes to she has some couple 00:21:32.399 questions about going down a playground 00:21:33.749 slide with shorts and long pants on to 00:21:35.549 see you know which would be more 00:21:36.720 advantageous and she's talking about 00:21:38.879 these things she sends him off to do the 00:21:40.759 the the experiment all the kids have 00:21:43.259 their inclined plane they're sliding 00:21:44.249 their washers pushing the stop watches 00:21:46.440 the cameras going around to the kids and 00:21:47.759 the kids like very disengaged in this 00:21:49.649 and like they slide the washers I think 00:21:50.879 0.18 would write it down because of 00:21:52.649 course everyone knows what the answer is 00:21:53.519 gonna be right now for a lot of people 00:21:57.299 that's an experiment but for the kids it 00:21:59.970 was an experiment because they know the 00:22:01.080 smooth sighs faster than the foam side 00:22:02.700 so there wasn't really anything to find 00:22:04.049 out in doing that right and there was no 00:22:06.149 look on any kids face that led led me to 00:22:08.519 think that the thing and so this is why 00:22:09.749 people love science right nobody nobody 00:22:12.539 saw that as the fascination and this 00:22:14.759 thing and I asked the teacher to 00:22:16.230 consider I said well you know I wonder 00:22:17.960 you know there are questions that I 00:22:20.490 don't really know the answer to about 00:22:21.899 this problem I mean for example what 00:22:23.999 does the angle of the plane have to do 00:22:25.830 with how fast the washers go on each 00:22:27.210 side because of course when the board's 00:22:28.799 lying flat you put the washer on one 00:22:30.059 side it's not gonna go anywhere 00:22:31.320 if you stand it up on its end they're 00:22:33.240 both gonna go the same speed no matter 00:22:34.440 what side is facing the washer so when 00:22:36.509 does that change and how does this 00:22:38.340 change proportionally relative to the 00:22:39.929 angle the board now I don't know the 00:22:41.279 answer to that feature didn't know the 00:22:42.480 answer that either right now that's 00:22:45.029 worth an experiment but on our campus 00:22:48.359 and maybe here true at McGill 00:22:49.830 a lot of freshmen come in and take you 00:22:51.869 know lab classes in the sciences and 00:22:53.999 they take a chemistry lab and they'll do 00:22:55.799 something that's called an experiment 00:22:56.970 but the water has to turn blue for you 00:22:58.649 to get credit right now that's not an 00:23:01.440 experiment that's a recipe right and if 00:23:03.960 our goal is to teach people to think 00:23:06.029 scientifically right one of the things 00:23:07.980 that that requires is having them 00:23:10.559 actually create questions and then 00:23:12.929 collect data in a way that allows them 00:23:15.659 to answer the questions right which is a 00:23:18.029 different way of thinking about learning 00:23:19.080 so what are we talking about science is 00:23:20.789 writing music making whatever the point 00:23:23.309 I music making Express something of the 00:23:24.899 human beings now if my goal is to play 00:23:27.480 the cello and I'm gonna play this lovely 00:23:29.369 language piece for somebody now I have a 00:23:32.399 reason to learn to cross strings without 00:23:34.559 making lumps in my sound I have a reason 00:23:37.289 to shift without hearing the shift 00:23:39.389 because now the goal is an expressive 00:23:41.879 one and it has to do with a listener and 00:23:44.279 not with what I'm doing physically now 00:23:46.950 that's a very different way of thinking 00:23:48.210 about the way we present music learning 00:23:49.769 two children and two adults too for that 00:23:51.989 matter 00:23:52.409 there's a colleague of mine who teaches 00:23:54.299 at Texas Tech named William Wesley and 00:23:56.039 he wrote a wonderful book about learning 00:23:57.929 music called the perfect wrong note and 00:23:59.940 one of the things that I saw bill do 00:24:01.590 he's a great pianist at a workshop one 00:24:04.200 time he's working with these very 00:24:05.669 advanced pianists he's lovely players 00:24:07.649 and he had them play and they all played 00:24:10.830 at whatever pieces they were playing for 00:24:12.169 this little masterclass and he had one 00:24:14.789 of the students come stand at the end of 00:24:16.109 the piano facing another student who was 00:24:19.019 sitting at the piano to play and and 00:24:20.789 bill said to this person now what play 00:24:23.070 to him and I couldn't believe how much 00:24:25.950 is playing changed right because now all 00:24:28.409 of a sudden he was playing to somebody 00:24:31.429 now this is true in every aspect of what 00:24:35.070 people do in school I'll give another 00:24:36.840 example of that when I when I first went 00:24:38.820 to Texas I had a doctoral student very 00:24:40.350 bright woman a terrific pianist lovely 00:24:42.570 teacher not a particularly skillful 00:24:44.399 writer and I was struggling to trying to 00:24:47.129 get her to write better and she was 00:24:48.269 struggling too and we were both very 00:24:49.379 frustrated and it was a tough thing to 00:24:51.239 do and I don't know what made me think 00:24:54.690 of this but one Friday afternoon I said 00:24:57.269 here's what I could do go home this 00:24:58.859 weekend this is before email and before 00:25:00.990 that old 00:25:02.720 go home and write a letter to your 00:25:05.240 mother about this project that you're 00:25:06.890 working on and bring it back to me on 00:25:07.940 Monday and she came back on Monday with 00:25:10.340 this letter that she had written her 00:25:11.390 mother about this project she was 00:25:12.440 working on it was the best writing of 00:25:13.970 hers I'd ever seen now you could say 00:25:16.430 well you know it suits her mother and no 00:25:18.710 actually that was the first time that 00:25:20.270 she was writing to someone write that 00:25:22.790 the idea is now I'm writing with a 00:25:24.950 reader in mind so I have to think about 00:25:27.320 what is my mother already understand 00:25:28.640 about that what do I need to explain to 00:25:30.500 her what questions might she have when 00:25:32.720 she gets to this part in my explanation 00:25:34.640 that I can anticipate and write and now 00:25:36.680 writing becomes an entirely different 00:25:38.420 inner and enterprise that many students 00:25:40.880 in college don't experience right if 00:25:42.500 you're in a musicology class and your 00:25:45.350 professor wrote the definitive text on a 00:25:48.050 lake court that's a Beethoven and your 00:25:49.580 assignment is to write a paper on the 00:25:50.900 gross of fuga who you're writing to 00:25:53.080 right and so what you do what many 00:25:55.850 college students do you gather as much 00:25:57.410 information as you can and stuff it in 00:25:58.820 the paper hoping that when your 00:25:59.750 professor reads it she'll find what 00:26:01.610 she's looking for somewhere in the paper 00:26:02.690 and you know give you a good grade which 00:26:04.910 is not what writing is about right it's 00:26:07.970 about conveying things to other human 00:26:09.530 beings if we look at what has now been 00:26:14.780 studied in in terms of how we get people 00:26:17.630 to practice and play more effectively 00:26:21.160 these are the things that in domains in 00:26:24.050 and out of music have been looked at 00:26:26.390 over time but think about how musicians 00:26:30.010 actually learn effectively and again 00:26:33.380 this is this has been studied not only 00:26:34.700 in music but outside of music as well 00:26:36.590 and my focus of attention I mean where 00:26:38.840 are people directing their listening 00:26:41.390 attention their visual attention their 00:26:42.950 physical attention what are they 00:26:43.970 thinking about when they're singing or 00:26:46.010 playing observation of a model has also 00:26:49.100 been studied to some extent about how 00:26:52.250 the effect that that has on music 00:26:54.080 learners variability of practice has 00:26:56.180 been studied a great deal outside of 00:26:57.500 music less so in music feedback focus 00:27:00.650 and frequency again when teachers are 00:27:02.990 working with learners what feedback is 00:27:04.910 doing of course is helping learners 00:27:06.080 decide where their attention should go 00:27:08.060 what kind of auditory discriminations 00:27:09.680 and physical discriminations that they 00:27:11.960 should be making and physical guidance 00:27:14.060 I'm gonna show about a couple of studies 00:27:15.830 that 00:27:16.630 that I've done with some colleagues of 00:27:17.920 mine and I'll sort of take you through 00:27:19.750 them relatively quickly to tell you 00:27:21.040 about what kinds of things that we're 00:27:22.120 trying to work on to figure out how 00:27:24.280 these things can be applied you know in 00:27:25.960 a music context effectively um we we we 00:27:30.610 know from Gabi wolf and and colleagues 00:27:33.220 and a number of people who've been 00:27:34.060 working charlie Shea who've been working 00:27:35.740 on focus of attention and motor behavior 00:27:39.100 that as learners gain skill and all of 00:27:42.940 us develop through our lives just 00:27:44.440 learning to use our bodies effectively 00:27:46.410 one thing that we know pretty clearly is 00:27:49.390 that when you focus attention on aspects 00:27:51.910 of your body that had become highly 00:27:53.020 automated you actually interfere with 00:27:55.810 the behavior you actually interfere with 00:27:57.850 the automaticity in a way that is solved 00:28:02.230 when you focus attention on the effects 00:28:04.000 of your movements rather than the 00:28:05.110 movements themselves there's some 00:28:08.140 interesting work that's been done at the 00:28:10.180 University of Chicago by Sean by Locke 00:28:12.040 and and and several others that have 00:28:13.960 looked on what happens when learners 00:28:16.450 when doers are focusing on different 00:28:18.250 aspects of their behavior one of these 00:28:20.320 that we know and this is this has been 00:28:22.570 done for example uh is a very old study 00:28:25.330 that was done with a little transducer 00:28:26.710 where you had a hand exercise spring and 00:28:29.320 learners were asked to squeeze the 00:28:31.690 spring and think about what they're 00:28:32.740 doing with their fingers versus thinking 00:28:34.600 about what is happening to the force 00:28:36.850 that's being applied to the spring all 00:28:38.590 of us know when we're just thinking 00:28:39.880 about how our bodies move I can pick up 00:28:41.920 this remote very easily without even 00:28:43.630 thinking about I don't even have to look 00:28:44.920 but if I start to give attention to what 00:28:46.840 my fingers are doing and what my hands 00:28:48.310 doing I actually interfere with the 00:28:50.470 fluidity of the movement which has now 00:28:51.940 become highly automated so one of the 00:28:54.970 things that we are interested in about 00:28:57.250 music making and I refer back to the kid 00:28:59.290 who was playing at the very beginning 00:29:00.720 what should music learners be thinking 00:29:03.130 about what should they be focusing on 00:29:04.840 when they're learning to play an 00:29:06.250 instrument when they're learning to sing 00:29:07.920 you know whenever I see people in a 00:29:11.080 beginning wind class and even beyond 00:29:14.800 that sometimes I see people breathing in 00:29:17.140 a way that's very ineffective which is 00:29:19.540 odd to me I mean we've been breathing 00:29:21.190 all of our lives and the only time I 00:29:23.320 would ever see somebody breathe like 00:29:24.790 that is somebody who's been taught how 00:29:27.280 to breathe in a music class right now 00:29:30.400 it's nursing to me when you go into a 00:29:31.870 beginning win class and someone comes 00:29:34.150 into the closet services one now we're 00:29:35.200 gonna learn how to breathe well wait a 00:29:37.120 minute all my life 00:29:38.440 well once I started giving attention to 00:29:40.150 the things that I'm doing with my body 00:29:41.350 I'm liable to do things now that are 00:29:43.390 less effective than I would be doing if 00:29:45.340 I were using automatic processes that 00:29:47.080 I've developed over years of experience 00:29:49.480 and you know for me just a little bit of 00:29:53.680 a personal experience here when I first 00:29:55.570 started teaching I I had a job teaching 00:30:00.040 band and orchestra in it in Atlanta 00:30:02.050 Georgia as a wonderful job I loved every 00:30:03.760 period that I taught except third period 00:30:06.250 which was a class called beginning band 00:30:08.580 and it was miss named because there 00:30:11.440 wasn't anything beginning about any of 00:30:14.170 those children she went I just misspoke 00:30:16.840 it's called intermediate band it wasn't 00:30:18.400 anything intermedia about those children 00:30:19.660 except they'd all owned their 00:30:20.890 instruments for a year right so I had 00:30:22.929 these students in this in this class 00:30:24.580 they were been playing for a year they 00:30:26.920 couldn't do much of anything just to 00:30:28.840 give you an idea of what these students 00:30:29.800 were like I had a flute player who've 00:30:30.910 been playing for a year she could play G 00:30:32.500 to C and the first octave in her 00:30:33.700 position looked something like that 00:30:35.110 which even if you hadn't had a flute 00:30:37.210 class you know that's bad 00:30:38.620 I had a trumpet player who played notes 00:30:40.870 that were so short if you were looking 00:30:42.970 away you wouldn't know what was making 00:30:44.260 that sound you know it sounds kind of go 00:30:47.160 like that sometimes I'd be giving out 00:30:49.090 you know I've been working with 00:30:49.750 clarinets or something and and Tim would 00:30:51.760 play a note I look at the intercom I 00:30:52.990 thought the principal was calling me but 00:30:54.160 it was Tim playing out it was a kid 00:30:56.020 playing trombone for a year who no one 00:30:57.850 ever told him about using his tongue to 00:30:59.530 articulate so he played very portamento 00:31:01.540 all the time so I was teaching this 00:31:04.540 class and I found that as the school 00:31:07.480 year was going on I was giving them more 00:31:09.520 and more time at the end of the period 00:31:10.750 to put their instruments away and by 00:31:14.650 October I was up to about 20 minutes of 00:31:16.559 swabbing and drying and and at that time 00:31:22.170 this tenor sax player who almost every 00:31:25.660 day he would come to me the beginning of 00:31:26.860 class and he was always out of out of 00:31:28.450 breath because junior high kids are 00:31:29.500 always out of breath you know to go you 00:31:31.360 should do but we gonna play today 00:31:34.540 you know just hoping I'm gonna say no 00:31:36.370 you know we're gonna read a book 00:31:37.540 yes--it's band get your instrument for 00:31:39.190 God's sake so anyway they get out and do 00:31:40.780 this thing so Tim goes back to the 00:31:42.310 Beckley 00:31:42.940 mr. mister room and I hear him in the 00:31:45.610 back playing Louie Louie on his tenor 00:31:47.050 saxophone so back in the back of the 00:31:49.300 room just playing fine a flan flan flan 00:31:52.300 flan flan flan flan flan for not the 00:31:57.310 melody just the bass part right over and 00:31:59.410 over again and Tim goes back in the room 00:32:02.680 and I'm sort of standing outside the 00:32:03.790 door eavesdropping and Tim goes hey a 00:32:05.380 man what are you playing 00:32:07.330 now if these instruments had not been in 00:32:09.640 the same transposition I would be an 00:32:11.740 attorney so he said well I don't know 00:32:14.590 let me let me see Fe I think it first 00:32:16.960 notes F so he teaches him how to play 00:32:18.820 Louie Louie 00:32:20.080 the bass part on the trumpet so two of 00:32:21.940 them they're playing together Flynn 00:32:23.080 Flynn Flynn Flynn so they're just over 00:32:28.960 and over again you know pianists have 00:32:30.160 heart and soul tenor saxophone players 00:32:31.930 have Louie Louie so anyway so the bell 00:32:34.390 rings every else is leaving they're 00:32:36.580 still in their plan III had to make them 00:32:39.190 stop and put their horns away and go to 00:32:40.900 class now I'm a one trial learner so I 00:32:44.470 went home that night I wrote Louie Louie 00:32:45.760 for the whole class you know not the 00:32:47.440 melody just the bass part and the next 00:32:50.590 day I taught more in that class period 00:32:52.720 than I taught in the six weeks leading 00:32:54.340 up to that right I taught the nice 00:32:57.730 trombone player that who's desperately 00:32:59.260 trying to re articulate those three 00:33:00.400 notes without using his time you don't 00:33:01.930 go you know if you put your tongue in 00:33:06.700 the further that you'd hear notes Larry 00:33:08.170 be really nice and Tim I got him to open 00:33:10.960 his teeth so like air would go into the 00:33:12.790 trumpet you'd you're like a tone you 00:33:14.170 know and everything not if he is the 00:33:19.270 next day when they came back of course 00:33:21.460 the terrace expert didn't come up and 00:33:23.620 say are we gonna play today you know I'm 00:33:24.880 gonna say right he said we've been Louie 00:33:26.590 Louie today you know and I was trying to 00:33:27.820 be cool I said well I don't know get 00:33:28.990 your instruments of course we Arctic God 00:33:30.760 so so when they all came back not half 00:33:35.770 way into that second day the tenor sax 00:33:37.600 will player who startled this rose again 00:33:38.710 says hey mister dude what notes are you 00:33:41.020 playing now that was the first time 00:33:43.840 anyone that room had any interest in 00:33:46.240 learning something that I had to teach 00:33:47.340 because what I was trying to do is teach 00:33:50.170 them to play their instruments and they 00:33:52.360 had signed up for the class with the 00:33:53.890 bizarre expectation that they were going 00:33:55.360 to make music every day 00:33:56.700 right now I would tell you I the the 00:34:00.910 book that I was teaching out of 00:34:02.670 literally is no longer in print it was 00:34:05.320 called master method for a band and 00:34:08.050 actually should be called task master 00:34:09.460 method for a band and when you open the 00:34:11.800 book at the beginning you know there's a 00:34:13.179 page of concert b-flat whole notes and 00:34:16.090 whole rests in different configurations 00:34:17.860 so like there's a whole note and a whole 00:34:19.690 rest and a whole note and a whole rest 00:34:20.860 next time one whole note two whole rests 00:34:23.168 and then a whole this goes on for a page 00:34:25.000 right so you have rooms full of children 00:34:26.649 gone bed rest - this goes on for pages 00:34:32.230 like that right 00:34:33.040 what line line eight had all whole rest 00:34:35.320 just to be sure you're paying attention 00:34:36.489 you know and then you get the next page 00:34:40.090 an old history concert be flying concert 00:34:41.918 sees him it's goes on for pages like 00:34:45.699 this right now I can't imagine somebody 00:34:49.840 who's in that class right sitting at the 00:34:52.030 bus stop with their trumpet case and 00:34:53.699 having a friend say what is that is it a 00:34:56.469 trumpet yeah well take it out and play 00:34:58.150 something for me okay I will but you 00:35:04.390 know no kids gonna say is it too late to 00:35:06.400 sign up maybe I can I can get in there I 00:35:08.050 don't know not again the reason I'm 00:35:13.210 saying all this it really has to do with 00:35:15.700 with memory formation and learning right 00:35:18.430 because when we understand something 00:35:21.490 deeply whatever the thing happens to be 00:35:23.670 the depth of that understanding present 00:35:25.990 provides a framework for all the things 00:35:27.790 that we learn about related to that 00:35:30.070 thing right I my students oh here we 00:35:33.130 give a lecture for an hour no notes and 00:35:34.810 I'm calling references out of the air 00:35:35.920 and again and someone come to save dr. 00:35:37.300 dude I don't know how you remember all 00:35:38.620 our stuff 00:35:38.980 I couldn't possibly remember all that 00:35:40.570 stuff and my response to them is you 00:35:42.490 know you're absolutely right you 00:35:43.330 couldn't possibly remember all that 00:35:44.620 stuff but that has nothing to do with 00:35:46.510 the inherent limitations of your memory 00:35:47.950 store right the reason I can remember 00:35:50.080 this stuff and you can't right now yet 00:35:52.540 is that my memory is organized entirely 00:35:55.300 differently than yours and if in fact we 00:35:58.780 organize memory around what are the 00:36:01.360 fundamental principles of the discipline 00:36:03.040 whatever the discipline is and that's 00:36:05.170 what's on the front of people's thinking 00:36:06.760 all the way through the process of 00:36:08.260 learning we change the way learners 00:36:09.670 function 00:36:10.220 now again this is not a music thing this 00:36:12.870 is a this is a school thing it has to do 00:36:15.000 with mathematics it has to do with 00:36:16.260 languages it has to do with history it 00:36:18.690 has to do with everything right because 00:36:20.160 typically the mistake that we make is 00:36:22.980 that people come to school being 00:36:25.050 generally incapable of doing what we're 00:36:26.550 gonna teach them how to do and we need 00:36:28.260 to get them ready to get to the good 00:36:30.570 stuff right and in all that getting 00:36:33.330 ready time what they're learning is a 00:36:35.790 way of thinking about the subject matter 00:36:37.590 and the way of behaving in the subject 00:36:39.360 matter that will actually keep them from 00:36:41.220 being fluent and successful in the 00:36:43.560 future 00:36:43.890 now I understand this does anybody who's 00:36:47.160 a caring teacher who wants to sort of 00:36:48.600 help people get better thinks well I 00:36:50.160 want to set you up so carefully that 00:36:52.020 you're not going to make many mistakes 00:36:53.910 and I went to school as an undergraduate 00:36:56.220 in a very behaviorally oriented teacher 00:36:59.130 preparation program right and I got very 00:37:01.560 good at setting up people so carefully 00:37:03.480 that I can almost obviate error in 00:37:05.670 learners I certainly reduce the error 00:37:07.560 rate to a very very small size but the 00:37:10.440 problem with that is is it all of us who 00:37:13.080 learn anything in an actual environment 00:37:15.270 learn through a process of error making 00:37:17.940 and error correcting on our own and the 00:37:21.420 question you have to ask in school when 00:37:23.310 are there opportunities for that and I'm 00:37:26.340 sort of changing what I was going to 00:37:27.600 talk about today in reference to the 00:37:28.710 talk that we had in the past couple 00:37:30.750 hours at the workshop to say this you 00:37:33.210 know error making is an essential part 00:37:35.400 of learning anything deeply and in 00:37:38.520 school when we try to take something 00:37:40.380 that's complicated and messy and we 00:37:43.410 systematize it what we often obviate is 00:37:46.560 opportunities to make errors that an 00:37:48.630 informal learner about how they need to 00:37:50.940 think and what they need to know and 00:37:52.320 what they need to do you know often I 00:37:54.960 will see a kid on a tricycle or I'd not 00:37:57.060 a tricycle a bicycle with training 00:37:58.290 wheels and see the training wheels set 00:38:00.840 wrong right and what I mean by that is 00:38:03.420 the training wheels are set so all three 00:38:05.820 wheels the bicycle wheel the two 00:38:07.260 training wheels are touching the ground 00:38:08.340 at the same time now that's not how 00:38:11.370 training wheels need to be set up and 00:38:12.600 why is that because when they're set up 00:38:14.520 like that the kid on the bicycle gets no 00:38:16.680 information about the position of his 00:38:19.020 body and what it does to the bicycle 00:38:20.850 right because if I'm set up so care 00:38:23.740 that no matter what I do the bicycle is 00:38:25.510 gonna remain upright well I'm not 00:38:27.340 learning anything about the bicycle 00:38:28.960 right and if the training wheels are off 00:38:30.760 the ground by a couple inches on either 00:38:32.380 side now I notice that when I do this 00:38:34.690 the bicycle goes that way so I make an 00:38:36.760 error that I can correct but it's not a 00:38:38.320 catastrophic a catastrophic error right 00:38:40.750 I'm I'm gonna tip over 00:38:42.970 but I won't tip over all the way to 00:38:44.470 where I hit the ground and learning 00:38:46.720 experiences need to look like that right 00:38:49.450 there need to be sufficient 00:38:50.890 opportunities to make errors that are 00:38:53.470 not catastrophic and most of the time 00:38:56.260 when we set up learning experiences for 00:38:57.640 learners in school that's not the way we 00:39:00.010 create them right we set them up in a 00:39:01.660 way where there are few opportunities to 00:39:05.140 do things that matter a lot and if I 00:39:09.130 were to say characterize most 00:39:11.650 experiences in colleges that the 00:39:13.930 assessment opportunities for learners 00:39:15.610 are low in frequency and high in 00:39:17.710 magnitude they don't happen very often 00:39:19.570 and when they happen they matter a ton 00:39:21.369 and in order to get good at something 00:39:23.590 whatever that something happens to be 00:39:24.970 that has to flip right there have to be 00:39:27.040 many opportunities to try and make 00:39:29.170 mistakes and self-correct in a way that 00:39:31.780 changes the way your memory works 00:39:33.160 because in order to do that effectively 00:39:35.190 right you have to be in a situation 00:39:37.990 where error making is not daunting in 00:39:42.130 terms of attitude right I mean I I often 00:39:46.240 put up a slide I won't put up a slide 00:39:48.070 say but I'll tell you about it today I I 00:39:49.930 ask people to solve a simple division 00:39:53.830 problem by fractions so I put up a slide 00:39:55.690 that has 1/2 divided by 3/4 equals and I 00:39:59.890 ask people to raise their hand and 00:40:00.990 answer the question right and what's 00:40:03.970 interesting to me when I put up that 00:40:04.990 slide and I look out a room full of 00:40:06.820 highly educated people I say someone 00:40:08.859 raise your hand ask that question and 00:40:10.000 almost nobody raises their hand and at 00:40:12.369 Texas I often give the opening talk on 00:40:14.380 teaching for the new faculty seminars 00:40:15.940 and put that slide up and I got a bunch 00:40:17.380 of PhDs in the room and people with 00:40:18.880 terminal degrees and faculty positions 00:40:20.560 somewhere else when they transfer to 00:40:21.550 Texas I say somebody raise your hand 10 00:40:23.320 what the answer is no we raise your 00:40:24.400 hands have five guys from a math 00:40:25.359 department you know it's a problem 00:40:27.280 that's taught in fourth grade and I ask 00:40:29.530 my colleagues to consider why aren't you 00:40:30.700 raising your head right and the answer 00:40:33.700 is the same reason your students don't 00:40:35.109 raise your head but raise their hand 00:40:36.190 when you ask a question 00:40:37.680 what if I was wrong what if it's a trick 00:40:39.720 you know what if I you know I raised my 00:40:42.090 hand you called him me I said the wrong 00:40:43.290 answer then what well then nothing right 00:40:46.230 but we've been in school long enough 00:40:48.230 that we've taken this sort of open pick 00:40:51.630 me I'll try I don't know what I'm doing 00:40:53.550 and become that right also during that 00:40:57.240 party Qing there was elementary school 00:40:59.550 adjacent to my campus and two days a 00:41:01.050 week I would go over and teach the 00:41:02.490 elementary children the KN one kids 00:41:04.620 music because there wasn't enough hours 00:41:06.030 of music teacher time for the regular 00:41:07.200 music teacher and whenever I be around 00:41:10.020 those children those even get to be 00:41:10.890 around very young children oh how 00:41:11.850 delightful they are I would pose a 00:41:13.200 question and say someone raise your hand 00:41:14.370 and dancing with everything hand went up 00:41:15.660 they didn't care I picked me I'll try 00:41:17.400 you know you know I was gonna ask and 00:41:18.810 now I sit in a doctoral seminar and say 00:41:21.690 I like something for talk just a minute 00:41:22.680 every looks at the table you know and 00:41:25.380 I'm thinking what happened to you what 00:41:27.660 took that bright open with it pick me 00:41:30.210 I'll try and turns you into that and the 00:41:33.480 only common variable that I can see ran 00:41:35.430 through all their past experiences they 00:41:37.320 all went to school you know and why and 00:41:40.950 what school shaped very inadvertently 00:41:44.160 very effectively very systematically is 00:41:46.920 an avoidance of situations where there 00:41:49.650 is likely to be error making and 00:41:51.590 everything that we learn in life outside 00:41:53.460 of school that we learn effectively is 00:41:55.530 full of error making you watch a little 00:41:57.690 infant learning to ambulate 00:41:59.490 right and they're falling down all the 00:42:02.400 time right there they're tipping over 00:42:04.440 they're not getting what they want 00:42:05.940 and yet as they get more and more 00:42:09.390 skillful in moving and grasping and 00:42:11.790 doing all the things that little 00:42:12.690 children do right they're doing that 00:42:14.940 because their behavior is highly goal 00:42:16.680 directed and it's fraught with error and 00:42:19.130 if you imagine that creating those kinds 00:42:21.630 of experiences in schools where the 00:42:23.970 behavior that we're asking students to 00:42:25.320 do has clear goals that are related to a 00:42:28.140 realistic outcome whether it's music 00:42:30.570 making whether it's solving a problem 00:42:32.280 whether it's going gathering some data 00:42:34.170 to answer a question whatever we're 00:42:36.420 doing with that creating it in such a 00:42:38.430 way that learners have opportunities to 00:42:40.380 try and fail and self correct because 00:42:43.800 without that it's really impossible to 00:42:46.530 learn effectively now you might say for 00:42:48.330 all of us who were in here who went 00:42:49.470 through a typical education 00:42:51.450 experience him I said well we went 00:42:53.520 through something like this for I sat in 00:42:54.660 rooms like this for many hours and I 00:42:56.160 turned out great so what's the problem 00:42:58.080 right and of course the problem is all 00:43:00.180 of us in this room who have been really 00:43:01.440 successful did much more than was asked 00:43:04.080 of us when we're sitting in these rooms 00:43:05.220 right we actually left the room and 00:43:07.980 talked about some problem that we didn't 00:43:10.110 understand that happened during the 00:43:11.160 lecturer or we would get together and do 00:43:12.930 something on our own that was not 00:43:14.130 assigned to us but many students who 00:43:16.290 come to school don't do that 00:43:18.630 right for whatever reason and so that 00:43:22.020 it's incumbent on us I think to create 00:43:23.970 experiences in the classroom that 00:43:26.040 actually make it more likely that that 00:43:27.420 kind of thing is going to happen I'm 00:43:29.810 just want to look at my time because I 00:43:31.710 wanna be sure I leave time for questions 00:43:32.670 um it I think rather than get into a 00:43:36.660 whole different strain of thought I 00:43:38.040 think I'm gonna stop here and and ask 00:43:40.500 whether there are questions and we could 00:43:42.780 have a discussion about what I would 00:43:43.800 talk about but anyway let me thank you 00:43:45.120 on a late Thursday afternoon before Good 00:43:47.520 Friday for coming and listen to me talk 00:43:48.810 today thanks a lot 00:43:54.220 thank you",

welcome to the show Bob Juke thank you 00:03:55.799 CH it's great to be here so look we 00:03:58.079 actually met when you were at theal 00:03:59.640 austalian conference here in Adelaide I 00:04:01.200 think it was two years ago now because 00:04:02.840 we've got our next one coming up middle 00:04:04.079 of this year and look I thoroughly 00:04:05.680 enjoyed all your sessions you did a 00:04:07.319 couple of Keynotes and you also did 00:04:08.959 something that I love doing when I 00:04:10.319 present workshops which is actually 00:04:11.920 teach students live so I wondered what 00:04:15.680 what do you hope uh teachers get when 00:04:17.639 they see you in action on the stage 00:04:19.519 teaching another student what are some 00:04:21.040 of the things that you hope they pick 00:04:23.080 up well you know I I've been thinking 00:04:25.520 over the past couple years in particular 00:04:27.759 about the idea of how important noticing 00:04:31.120 is not only as on the part of the 00:04:33.520 teacher but helping students and 00:04:35.520 Learners learn to notice what's going on 00:04:38.479 as well and uh you know I I think often 00:04:41.400 when people work with students who are 00:04:43.680 working on whatever skills they're 00:04:45.240 trying to master uh the the chunks of 00:04:49.280 material that they work on at any given 00:04:51.479 moment are so large and have so many 00:04:54.120 parts to them it's very difficult 00:04:55.960 oftentimes for both teacher and student 00:04:58.759 to really know notice the Small Things 00:05:01.800 uh that are taking place and you know I 00:05:03.320 mean it's it I'm sure this is such a 00:05:06.479 hacking phrase anymore you know but it's 00:05:08.000 the little things that make things great 00:05:10.440 you know and I think lots of times 00:05:12.800 especially you know people who are 00:05:14.160 impatient and trying to get through 00:05:15.360 things fast and trying to cover a lot of 00:05:17.080 material in a short period of time it's 00:05:19.479 easy to overlook the small features of 00:05:22.120 whatever is you're working on that 00:05:23.720 really lead to something being refined 00:05:26.520 and 00:05:27.400 beautiful yeah I I agree that was one 00:05:29.720 thing that I really did pick up was the 00:05:31.919 uh care and attention with which you 00:05:34.840 gave every little bit of a students's 00:05:37.600 work and whereas I tend to work much 00:05:40.560 more on bigger picture things with 00:05:41.800 students and gloss over those little 00:05:44.039 details sometimes which I'm sure many 00:05:45.639 teachers do you the point you made was 00:05:48.400 actually going into depth on one thing 00:05:50.759 and getting it beautiful and perfect and 00:05:53.360 how the student would like it to be S to 00:05:55.720 sound that was the thing that you really 00:05:57.520 focused on which is what stuck with me 00:05:59.840 actually um and I think you had you had 00:06:01.960 a mantra of making little things great 00:06:04.600 versus making a lot of things better so 00:06:07.840 tell us about this Mantra of 00:06:10.360 yours well you know I actually that that 00:06:13.280 that Mantra comes from the human brain 00:06:15.840 actually you know I mean if you think 00:06:17.800 about what's required to learn anything 00:06:21.479 about a skill I mean the kind of memory 00:06:23.440 that that we refer to as procedural 00:06:25.680 memories memories for how to do things 00:06:28.080 the part of your brain that that stores 00:06:29.800 those memories and activates those 00:06:31.240 memories is not amenable to verbal 00:06:34.759 instruction you know and and we know 00:06:36.680 this about everything we try to do you 00:06:38.120 know we we can't just talk ourselves 00:06:40.319 into playing more evenly or you know 00:06:43.440 more quickly or whatever we have to do 00:06:45.039 ourselves into that you know yeah and 00:06:47.639 and I think one of the things that 00:06:48.800 happens is you think what would what 00:06:51.039 would signal the brain that this is 00:06:53.000 something that it should store or update 00:06:55.599 right and the more you're trying to do 00:06:58.080 at one time the 00:07:00.599 more confusing it is about what about 00:07:04.360 any practice trial is something to be 00:07:06.800 retained and and I think the other thing 00:07:08.599 is too you know when when 00:07:10.479 we're reinforced by the accomplishment 00:07:13.120 of a goal that reinforcement even makes 00:07:16.759 it more likely that we what whatever we 00:07:18.840 just did is going to become a lasting 00:07:20.720 part of our memory that's going to be 00:07:22.000 retrievable in the future and actually 00:07:24.879 to to just get better at something I 00:07:26.879 mean you're moving in the right 00:07:27.800 direction I mean certainly that this 00:07:29.479 there's something reinforcing about that 00:07:30.639 if you recognize your own progress but 00:07:32.639 when you really do it when all the parts 00:07:34.800 of your body are functioning the way 00:07:36.840 they're supposed to and the sound that 00:07:38.479 you're going for actually comes out the 00:07:40.520 way you intended it to come out that 00:07:43.039 creates a lasting memory in a way that 00:07:45.639 just you know small bits of progress 00:07:48.120 over a wide landscape of goals just 00:07:51.000 doesn't do right so you're actually 00:07:52.919 saying that we can tell our brains and 00:07:55.400 therefore our students brains what to 00:07:58.199 store and remember and ingrain better if 00:08:02.159 we focus down on sing simple single 00:08:04.840 things yeah and and this is not to take 00:08:07.440 away from the value in looking at Big 00:08:10.240 Picture things as well you know I I mean 00:08:12.400 what's what's interesting to my 00:08:13.840 colleagues and and me and we've been 00:08:16.080 looking at a lot of people who are 00:08:18.400 really experts in their discipline not 00:08:20.599 just in music but in other areas as well 00:08:21.960 and looking at how they practice and 00:08:24.159 when we talk to and observe really 00:08:27.159 artist level performers 00:08:29.800 um they they do have a big picture goal 00:08:32.719 in mind I mean there the the expressive 00:08:36.000 capacity whether it's playing the piano 00:08:38.080 or playing the guitar or whatever the 00:08:39.440 instrument happens to be they they are 00:08:41.799 expressive intentions sort of Define 00:08:44.839 what the physical goals need to be right 00:08:47.240 because if I'm going to make this this 00:08:49.080 line sound beautiful and languid and 00:08:51.920 calm well there are certain things that 00:08:53.800 have to happen physically to pull that 00:08:55.360 off right but to only working on the 00:08:58.040 physical things and not having also in 00:09:00.320 your mind what that expressive goal is I 00:09:03.680 think often takes away from uh the 00:09:07.959 ability to prioritize okay where should 00:09:10.320 I devote that attention to small things 00:09:13.120 because I don't really have an idea of 00:09:14.519 the big picture of what I'm going for 00:09:16.279 yeah that makes sense and so what kind 00:09:18.640 of language do you recommend teachers 00:09:20.720 use in order to distill and and try and 00:09:23.920 get students to really focus on one 00:09:26.120 single thing so student plays a line 00:09:28.360 what what do we say at end because we 00:09:30.120 often get that wrong I put my hand up 00:09:31.839 and say oh that was great every time 00:09:34.000 it's like that was really not great yeah 00:09:36.079 yeah yeah what Lang what's your 00:09:38.000 suggestion there well well I I I don't 00:09:40.360 think it has to do necessarily with what 00:09:42.519 we say but in another way I think it has 00:09:45.040 to do with what we ask in terms of what 00:09:47.959 we ask our students about what they do 00:09:49.720 you know I I I find that you know what 00:09:52.839 typically happens in school and this 00:09:54.399 isn't just a music thing this is a 00:09:55.480 school thing I'm a teacher I ask you to 00:09:57.440 do something you do it and I tell you 00:09:59.320 how you how you did and we go on the 00:10:00.640 next thing you know that's kind of like 00:10:01.959 the the drill that's not an effective 00:10:04.760 way to learn and if you think about how 00:10:06.600 how people how all of us learn in 00:10:09.200 informal settings that's so we're not in 00:10:11.120 school that we're not being taught we're 00:10:13.320 just kind of learning something whether 00:10:14.800 it's you know how to play a game on our 00:10:17.600 phone or how to find a find our way in a 00:10:20.360 new city or something like that there 00:10:22.760 there are certain features of that 00:10:23.959 learning that are really important and 00:10:26.480 and one of them is being cognizant of 00:10:29.839 our own error making I mean I think what 00:10:32.920 happens often times when we're teachers 00:10:35.079 we we we hear what's going on and often 00:10:36.880 we hear more about what's going on than 00:10:38.519 our students do so we're quick to inform 00:10:40.959 them by telling them what's happening 00:10:42.839 and what they need to be paying 00:10:43.760 attention to but I think what what what 00:10:45.880 what advantages a lot of Young Learners 00:10:47.519 and older Learners too for that 00:10:49.200 matter is by teachers asking students 00:10:52.760 about what they hear and what they feel 00:10:54.920 what what they're doing now all of us 00:10:56.959 have had plenty of students if we say 00:10:58.440 well would just think about that student 00:11:00.399 say well I don't 00:11:01.959 know you know I mean so but but but I 00:11:05.000 have a really good solution to that 00:11:07.079 problem and that is to ask students to 00:11:09.600 play things more than one time and ask 00:11:12.600 them to compare and explain how they 00:11:15.440 were different because none of us is 00:11:17.680 really capable of doing two things in a 00:11:19.560 row that are absolutely identical so 00:11:22.200 when we when we do you know a small 00:11:24.120 phrase or or something we have somebody 00:11:25.880 play that we say could you do that like 00:11:27.760 three times and tell me how those three 00:11:30.000 times are different well now what you've 00:11:31.800 done is you've switched on a listening 00:11:34.360 mode in the student that often isn't 00:11:37.040 there because they're in a doing mode 00:11:38.399 you know I'm I'm pushing I'm making sure 00:11:41.360 my foot's on the pedal do doing but I'm 00:11:43.120 not really listening to what I'm doing 00:11:44.880 and to make judgments to getting 00:11:46.639 students to make judgments about what 00:11:48.120 they do because of course that's what we 00:11:49.240 want them to do when they practice right 00:11:51.040 but if when they're in the lesson we're 00:11:52.560 making all the judgments and we're doing 00:11:54.240 all the explaining and we're doing all 00:11:55.920 the feedback about what's going on and 00:11:57.360 not really inviting them into that 00:11:59.880 process then I think we we miss a lot of 00:12:03.440 opportunities to change the way students 00:12:05.880 think about what they do you know 00:12:07.600 there's a really interesting uh 00:12:09.480 philosopher who teaches a tus named 00:12:11.200 Daniel Dennis he's written a lot of 00:12:12.600 things about Ai and and different kind 00:12:14.519 kind of things but I I was on a 00:12:16.760 conference program with him last summer 00:12:18.399 and and he was able to he came up with 00:12:20.720 this succinct phrase that expresses 00:12:22.760 something that I've talked about for a 00:12:23.920 long time and it's a difference between 00:12:26.079 between competence and comprehension 00:12:29.880 uh and it's really interesting a lot of 00:12:32.079 what we do in school we teach people to 00:12:34.480 be competent we teach students how to do 00:12:36.399 certain things I'm just talking about 00:12:37.519 physical things I'm talking about you 00:12:38.519 know 00:12:39.519 mathematical equations that kind St but 00:12:42.800 it's possible to be competent and not 00:12:44.519 really know what you're doing I mean 00:12:46.079 it's possible to get the right answer 00:12:48.240 and not really understand what you're 00:12:49.760 what you're what what you're doing and 00:12:51.560 and to me that's the great joy of 00:12:54.720 teaching is not just affecting the way 00:12:57.680 somebody behaves 00:12:59.560 but affecting the way they think about 00:13:01.279 what how how they behave you know which 00:13:02.959 is which is a a subtly but importantly 00:13:05.320 different thing absolutely you mentioned 00:13:08.320 the University was it toughs or 00:13:09.920 something that TS T tuu FTS in Boston 00:13:14.199 right toughs okay and the name of the 00:13:15.920 person because I know people love 00:13:17.120 researching Dan Daniel dennet d n NE TT 00:13:21.839 fantastic his most his his his most 00:13:24.360 recent book is called from bacteria to 00:13:27.000 Bach and Back Again so well got be 00:13:30.839 captured with the title alone EXA right 00:13:33.440 you know yeah so just going back one 00:13:36.600 step but I think one key takeaway that 00:13:38.800 teachers could try with their students 00:13:40.360 from as a result of listening to this 00:13:41.920 would be that idea of uh rather than 00:13:44.519 just jumping in and giving a response 00:13:47.000 one yes we could just ask them questions 00:13:49.279 about how they played things but as we 00:13:51.279 all know sometimes they're too worried 00:13:53.199 about playing to be listening to 00:13:54.639 anything they're doing and I remember 00:13:56.279 asking my student once I said after 00:13:58.759 afterwards ah so how how how' that go 00:14:01.759 can you give you a mark give yourself a 00:14:03.000 mark out of 10 uh and he's he's like no 00:14:06.079 I don't know and I said you were you 00:14:07.920 actually listening to what you're doing 00:14:09.079 and he said no I don't think so yeah 00:14:11.959 right exactly so your solution here is 00:14:14.399 to actually say rather than rather than 00:14:16.519 that actually upfront say okay I would 00:14:18.800 like you to actually play this phrase 00:14:20.720 three times in a row uh with a pause 00:14:23.000 between each and I want you to at the 00:14:25.920 end of that I'd like you to compare how 00:14:27.440 they went what are some of the 00:14:28.320 differences between them yeah and what 00:14:30.920 and what's really interesting to me 00:14:32.600 about that Tim is that students who are 00:14:35.000 normally very reticent to say anything 00:14:37.079 about what they're doing are much more 00:14:39.160 forthcoming when asked to compare 00:14:41.480 multiple iterations of the same thing 00:14:43.920 you know it's it's like you know if 00:14:46.560 you're sitting in a room full of people 00:14:47.639 and you point to some person say what do 00:14:49.279 you think about that shirt well I don't 00:14:51.560 know what I don't know what am I 00:14:52.639 supposed to say I mean what color it is 00:14:54.040 or whether it fits I you know I don't 00:14:55.560 know but if you say look at that shirt 00:14:57.240 and look at that shirt and tell me how 00:14:59.360 they're different well now I've got all 00:15:01.079 kinds of things to say right so that 00:15:03.839 that comparative judgment is and I want 00:15:06.000 to add one more thing about the asking 00:15:07.360 questions thing and I've been on this 00:15:09.399 kick now for about a a year and a half 00:15:12.000 I'm I'm very fond of it I I may be too 00:15:13.839 fond of it but I but I I think it really 00:15:15.639 has some some Merit and that is you know 00:15:17.839 when we ask people to comment on what 00:15:20.079 they do I think a natural tendency or at 00:15:23.480 least a tendency that's been ingrained 00:15:25.480 in people throughout school is to 00:15:27.800 express things in terms of an evaluative 00:15:30.120 judgment so we say well tell me what you 00:15:32.120 liked and what you didn't like about 00:15:33.199 what just happened you know tell me what 00:15:34.480 was positive what was negative about 00:15:35.639 what you just heard I mean that kind of 00:15:37.079 thing and I've I've you know in a way 00:15:40.639 that I'm sure many of my students find 00:15:42.279 annoying try to expunge that way of 00:15:44.759 asking questions from their language and 00:15:46.800 asking the question said what did you 00:15:48.319 notice about what just 00:15:50.000 happened I don't want you to tell me 00:15:51.639 whether it's good or bad we like that I 00:15:53.279 I don't care I just want to know what 00:15:54.759 you noticed and what's interesting to me 00:15:57.160 and I I I'm actually doing two two 00:15:58.839 experiments about this now but I don't 00:15:59.959 have the data yet but I'll tell you how 00:16:01.639 I want the data to come out right is is 00:16:04.759 that when people are are asked what they 00:16:07.800 notice without having to make an 00:16:09.279 evaluative Judgment at the front end you 00:16:11.600 know I'm not going to tell you whether 00:16:12.639 you liked it or whether you thought it 00:16:13.519 was good just what did you notice that 00:16:16.000 people are actually more forthcoming 00:16:17.639 right they they actually have more to 00:16:19.079 say because that you've taken out the 00:16:20.959 idea that you have to evaluate this and 00:16:23.399 rate it before you can say anything you 00:16:25.839 know and of course most of us are 00:16:27.160 loathed to say especially about some 00:16:28.720 else's performance well that was really 00:16:30.519 terrible you the scale of one to 10 that 00:16:32.240 was a two so but when you start saying 00:16:34.199 well you know I noticed that that that 00:16:35.920 the [ __ ] at the end it it's maybe it's 00:16:38.519 slowed down more than than I would have 00:16:40.360 slowed down well now okay I'm just 00:16:42.440 describing what I see in here I'm not 00:16:44.240 I'm not making evaluations I'm just 00:16:45.600 describing what I what I what I see in 00:16:47.600 here and I find that many young teachers 00:16:50.600 who because of just their social 00:16:52.279 practice in typical social interactions 00:16:54.199 aren't used to giving negative feedback 00:16:56.399 to their friends unless they're angry 00:16:58.519 you know that that being able to just 00:17:00.360 describe what you see and hear many 00:17:03.040 people are more comfortable talking 00:17:05.640 about what needs to be called attention 00:17:07.240 to just because they're not making an 00:17:08.679 evaluative 00:17:09.760 judgment and uh so suppose we could do 00:17:12.839 that uh for ourselves as well in our own 00:17:15.400 teaching even uh after a lesson what did 00:17:18.439 I notice happened to that lesson 00:17:19.919 particularly when things went 00:17:20.720 particularly well or or badly perhaps 00:17:23.160 but I also think yeah just just throwing 00:17:24.520 that question out there that makes a lot 00:17:25.599 of sense another great tip that we could 00:17:27.439 all try straight away what did you 00:17:29.520 notice about that first four bars that 00:17:32.559 you you've been working so hard on what 00:17:34.039 did you notice about it today I like it 00:17:35.520 thank you rob that's great um now just 00:17:39.280 and I just wanted to reiterate too you 00:17:40.559 were talking about competence versus 00:17:43.039 comprehension and uh and I in my own 00:17:46.120 teaching one of the things that I really 00:17:48.559 love doing with students is diving into 00:17:50.480 the chords and the harmony of any pretty 00:17:52.280 much any work that they're learning 00:17:53.840 because to me again they could play all 00:17:56.280 of that read the music do what the 00:17:58.720 composer says on the page but to 00:18:00.840 actually understand that actually this 00:18:02.440 is a 12 BBL structure or this is just 00:18:04.760 moving between 1 and four and five and 00:18:06.480 oh there's a Cadence at the end and how 00:18:08.159 that works that sort of thing can be 00:18:10.080 really pulled apart by looking into 00:18:11.520 things like Harmony are there any other 00:18:14.120 examples of that kind of more 00:18:16.200 comprehension based activities that 00:18:18.600 you've seen work well I you know I think 00:18:21.559 a lot of that has to do I mean often and 00:18:24.240 this is this is true in universities and 00:18:26.000 conservatories too you know people take 00:18:28.400 Theory class that's over there you know 00:18:30.520 and then they go take their performance 00:18:32.640 lessons and you know they take a music 00:18:34.080 history class and very seldom or less Le 00:18:38.240 should does all that stuff get put 00:18:39.559 together right I you know when when when 00:18:43.600 people are approaching a new piece of 00:18:45.360 music there there's actually actually 00:18:47.559 value in knowing where this music came 00:18:49.799 from and what other music was in in in 00:18:54.720 Vogue at the time and what people were 00:18:56.400 listening to and what came before this 00:18:58.159 and what was sort of unusual about this 00:19:00.640 piece that a composer hadn't written 00:19:02.799 before or and so so that now becomes 00:19:06.280 part of being an intelligent Music Maker 00:19:09.000 right is that you know things like that 00:19:10.600 and I think the same thing can be said 00:19:11.919 for the structure of the piece too I 00:19:13.480 mean like you say you know what the 00:19:15.760 harmonic structure is you know what a a 00:19:20.000 a a more rapid harmonic Rhythm does to 00:19:23.640 the feeling of a piece that a slower 00:19:25.440 harmonic Rhythm wouldn't do and to be 00:19:27.720 able to think about music in those terms 00:19:30.840 I I I I think when when when students 00:19:33.280 start to see that those things inform 00:19:36.080 your musical decisionmaking you know why 00:19:38.480 would you take more time there and not 00:19:40.520 just well I feel it you know I mean okay 00:19:42.720 fine but I but I mean are there are 00:19:44.520 there reasons why you should do 00:19:46.760 something you know why why you should 00:19:48.200 take more time or or change the the 00:19:50.880 loudness level that you're playing 00:19:52.080 something like that that's related to 00:19:54.400 the structure of the music and and and 00:19:57.320 to me when you invite students into all 00:19:59.679 of that it it it makes playing a musical 00:20:03.080 instrument all that more interesting I 00:20:04.880 I'm not just you know this isn't some 00:20:06.559 calisthenic exercise that I'm doing you 00:20:08.840 know I'm I actually have an 00:20:11.080 understanding of music that the average 00:20:12.760 person doesn't have and that's what 00:20:14.760 leads me to make decisions about what I 00:20:16.480 do 00:20:17.280 musically and making connections as you 00:20:19.400 say so so important for deepening the 00:20:21.559 understanding but also just making it 00:20:22.919 relevant for students too why am I 00:20:25.039 studying this you know history over here 00:20:27.559 and Theory let's yeah put all together 00:20:29.880 yeah I totally agree well and I you know 00:20:32.039 and I think it's I mean to me it's it's 00:20:34.520 cooler to know what's going on than not 00:20:37.200 and I think all the people who say you 00:20:38.679 know I'm kind of bored with this you 00:20:40.679 know the reason they're bored is because 00:20:42.320 it's not connected to anything you know 00:20:44.200 I do this thing you know I'm writing out 00:20:46.039 these scales and modes and yeah fine you 00:20:48.200 know but there's not it's not really 00:20:49.960 connected to the things that I listen to 00:20:52.360 the things that I'm trying to do on my 00:20:54.200 own on my on my instrument and that 00:20:57.080 connectedness is what makes makes it 00:20:58.520 actually engaging and 00:21:00.679 motivating you talk a lot about the 00:21:02.640 brain in your books and presentations as 00:21:04.559 well and and you mentioned before 00:21:05.840 retrieval I think was one of the words 00:21:07.360 you used and I've heard that used before 00:21:09.480 in uh practice in regard to uh breaking 00:21:13.559 up your practice into smaller segments 00:21:15.679 having breaks from it and coming back 00:21:17.200 and having to pull that knowledge back 00:21:18.799 out of your brain makes things stronger 00:21:21.159 um I don't know if I've summarize that 00:21:22.480 very well but can you tell us more about 00:21:24.760 uh that importance for us as teachers 00:21:27.120 when we're working improving students 00:21:29.000 practice Yeah well you know I I I I I 00:21:32.640 have a good short example that kind of 00:21:34.679 makes this it has to do with like 00:21:35.880 memorizing music I mean everybody you 00:21:37.720 know especially pianist that's sort of 00:21:39.360 an expectation sometimes that piano 00:21:40.720 gonna memorize their music Pro all that 00:21:42.760 kind of thing and that's the bane of 00:21:44.880 many people's existence because it's you 00:21:46.400 know intimidating and people forget and 00:21:48.559 oh my God and all that kind of stuff but 00:21:50.400 here's the thing in fact just talk about 00:21:51.960 my undergraduate class about this a 00:21:53.520 couple weeks ago so I had them do this 00:21:55.720 thing and I asked them to write down the 00:21:57.120 sequence of this that we were playing 00:21:59.120 soprano recorders in my class and I had 00:22:00.880 introduced them to some things and we 00:22:02.200 were playing together and I asked him to 00:22:03.400 write down the sequence of what we had 00:22:04.679 just done and that was on a Friday when 00:22:07.240 they came back on Monday I asked them to 00:22:10.480 get out piece of paper and see if they 00:22:12.559 could remember the sequence and write it 00:22:14.200 down again and then I asked the question 00:22:17.360 if I wanted you to remember this next 00:22:20.400 Friday would it be better to do what we 00:22:22.600 did today and have you try to remember 00:22:24.200 what happened last Friday or to do what 00:22:26.240 we did last Friday again today 00:22:28.840 and the intuitive answer would bew be 00:22:31.000 better just to do it again but actually 00:22:33.200 that's not what we be better what would 00:22:34.640 be better is trying to remember it and 00:22:37.360 that would make the memory the 00:22:38.760 subsequent Friday better now that's a 00:22:41.120 non-intuitive thing because you think 00:22:42.559 boy just keep doing this and a more I do 00:22:44.480 it damn it it's gonna get in there and 00:22:45.919 then I'll be actually that's not what 00:22:47.320 happens because what you're not 00:22:48.960 practicing is getting it out of your 00:22:51.720 memory and that's what retrieval 00:22:53.600 practice is all about right it's not 00:22:55.799 about how stuff gets in I mean that's 00:22:58.799 not trivial OB obviously but the big 00:23:01.360 deal is how do you practice getting it 00:23:03.559 out how do you practice remembering and 00:23:06.279 recalling things because that's going to 00:23:09.039 determine how memorable things are in 00:23:10.640 the future so you were asking about 00:23:12.000 breaking up your practice into smaller 00:23:13.919 chunks I mean what one of the things 00:23:15.520 that's interesting about that if if if 00:23:17.600 you practice for an hour in a day and 00:23:20.440 let's say you're working on one 00:23:21.559 particular thing for that hour by the 00:23:24.600 end of that hour if if you're practicing 00:23:26.640 well you're probably doing pretty well 00:23:28.279 with this 00:23:29.279 thing and most of us misperceive that 00:23:32.760 how we're doing at the end of the hour 00:23:34.720 is now how we do it all the time right 00:23:37.480 not recognizing that it took us an hour 00:23:39.640 to get to that right so if I practiced 00:23:43.679 like that not only am I taking an hour 00:23:46.919 to ramp up to whatever is my goal is and 00:23:50.000 not recognize that it takes me an hour 00:23:51.520 to get there I'm now overestimating how 00:23:54.600 well I know this right because at the 00:23:57.039 end of an hour it's pretty good you 00:23:59.200 right so if I break that up into three 00:24:01.120 20 minute things throughout the day at 00:24:03.520 the end of 20 minutes you know I get it 00:24:05.320 wherever I get it and when I come back 00:24:07.520 then for the next 20 minutes I forgot 00:24:10.799 some of what happened in the 20 minutes 00:24:12.600 that I practiced before and I have to 00:24:14.679 retrieve that again right and that 00:24:17.120 happens again in the third 20 minutes so 00:24:19.320 what I'm practicing in all of those 00:24:20.799 times that little scalop learning thing 00:24:22.679 it's going like this you know I I I 00:24:24.520 learn something I get pretty good and 00:24:26.399 then I step away from it and I forget 00:24:28.279 some of that and I come back and I have 00:24:29.799 to recall it again that's what's 00:24:32.440 actually making that memory going to 00:24:34.039 persist longer into the future than it 00:24:36.640 will if I just spend you know hours at a 00:24:38.720 time just banging on the same thing 00:24:40.760 right has the research been done on this 00:24:43.120 uh Bob yeah a ton right 00:24:47.600 great yeah I mean I mean the thing is 00:24:50.679 you know we talk a lot about so-called 00:24:53.679 muscle memory you know and I and really 00:24:57.840 I don't know what people actually mean 00:24:59.159 by that but I think what they mean by 00:25:00.640 that is somehow our motor system is 00:25:02.240 remembering this in a way that we can't 00:25:04.720 consciously uh access you know of course 00:25:07.640 it's not in our muscles it's all in our 00:25:09.600 brain right so so the memory isn't 00:25:11.799 really in our muscles but but but our 00:25:13.480 motor system can run out a sequence of 00:25:15.520 things that happens pretty regularly and 00:25:18.000 do it pretty 00:25:19.240 reliably until we don't and then we 00:25:22.559 realize we can't access it right because 00:25:24.080 I'm in the middle of this thing and now 00:25:26.039 for whatever reason I forgot 00:25:28.480 and I don't have the sweep and the 00:25:30.919 momentum of doing the movement that's 00:25:33.240 allowing my fingers just to go on their 00:25:35.799 own now I have to really remember was 00:25:37.600 that an A 00:25:38.840 flat and now I'm screwed right I I I I 00:25:43.000 really haven't known for a long time 00:25:44.880 whether it's an A flat I just been doing 00:25:46.679 this thing and I know it sounds right 00:25:48.080 and whatever you know we all yeah so so 00:25:51.880 I think you know to to be to put 00:25:54.440 yourself in situations where you have to 00:25:58.240 work harder to do what you're trying to 00:26:01.039 do and yet accomplish goals I I mean 00:26:04.440 that that's the thing I think everybody 00:26:06.320 who's trying to you know help people 00:26:08.039 learn better said well what's a what 00:26:10.200 what's a way to make this 00:26:11.799 easier and and by definition making it 00:26:14.559 easier means you weren't learn it as 00:26:16.120 well there's a wonderful phrase uh 00:26:18.240 there's a there there's a psychologist 00:26:19.720 at UCLA named Robert Bork V VJ r k and 00:26:23.960 he and his wife Elizabeth have done just 00:26:26.120 a tremendous amount of research about 00:26:28.360 learning and he and he has this phrase 00:26:30.120 that he came up with there a lovely 00:26:31.360 phrase and he calls it desirable 00:26:33.679 difficulty right you want to create 00:26:35.919 situations that are desirably difficult 00:26:38.360 because surmounting that difficulty will 00:26:41.320 actually make what you do more memorable 00:26:43.039 in the future my music staff is the 00:26:45.279 easiest and most efficient way to run 00:26:47.279 your music teaching business this 00:26:49.279 complete

it's 00:28:04.799 the perfect tool to navigate your studio 00:28:06.559 through the busy back to school 00:28:09.039 season and I think uh when we was 00:28:11.720 talking about practice as well one thing 00:28:13.640 that I picked up from watching you in 00:28:14.840 action was the number of times you got 00:28:16.880 students to repeat things going over 00:28:19.159 things more doing more of the same and 00:28:21.760 even if it was right the first time well 00:28:23.559 let's do it again and at the end you 00:28:25.919 said let's do it again and let's do it 00:28:28.039 another time and it was almost I hadn't 00:28:30.720 quite seen that much repetition happen 00:28:33.039 particularly in a lesson perhaps in our 00:28:34.440 own practice but yeah I think that was 00:28:36.679 Again part of modeling what you want 00:28:38.480 them to do at home right yeah yeah I 00:28:40.960 mean I I I see lessons as an opportunity 00:28:44.320 to practice my 00:28:46.399 students so I it's as if they're the 00:28:49.799 instrument playing the instrument and 00:28:52.039 I'm practicing them so I asked myself 00:28:55.080 after I get work with a student to do 00:28:56.360 something and that student did it once 00:28:57.840 and I I often ask this of my students 00:29:00.039 you know we're watching a video 00:29:00.960 recording of their of a lesson they've 00:29:02.799 taught they get to a point plate and a 00:29:04.640 student does something and I stop the 00:29:06.640 video I say okay so how much you willing 00:29:08.559 to bet that that student's going to do 00:29:11.360 it again just like they did it this time 00:29:13.240 you know and often it's like nothing 00:29:15.720 okay so why are you moving on then why 00:29:18.399 you going on right I mean and so so I 00:29:21.000 always ask the question of myself this 00:29:23.519 gets back to the noticing thing when 00:29:24.960 somebody does something correctly are 00:29:26.320 they noticing 00:29:28.080 what's going on 00:29:30.240 sufficiently that they actually would 00:29:32.559 when I'm no longer in their presence and 00:29:34.279 they're practicing on their own that 00:29:35.880 they will continue to notice the things 00:29:37.600 that are the central features of 00:29:39.919 whatever it is they're trying to 00:29:40.919 accomplish you know and I will say one 00:29:44.679 thing excuse me for 00:29:45.880 interrupting you know often what what I 00:29:48.279 think gets annoying to people if they're 00:29:51.120 not used to repeating a lot is you know 00:29:54.159 when we say we'll do it one more time 00:29:55.360 and they do it one more time we say well 00:29:56.840 let's let's do it another time do I I I 00:29:59.799 I just replace one more time with some 00:30:01.799 number other than one you know let's do 00:30:04.640 that six six six six more times and you 00:30:07.279 know students were think wow six that's 00:30:08.919 a lot I mean it's gonna take 90 seconds 00:30:10.559 for God's sake you know I me but but I 00:30:13.440 think people are so unused to that my my 00:30:16.279 colleague here Lori Scott who's one of 00:30:18.000 the best Suzuki teachers I've ever seen 00:30:20.080 seen in my life we have this little kid 00:30:22.240 come us and say we're gonna do this a 00:30:23.559 hundred times today that kid gets really 00:30:25.000 big I wow 100 times it takes minutes you 00:30:27.919 know because it's some little thing that 00:30:29.399 you do 100 times and but and I I think 00:30:32.279 we you know we think we do something 00:30:34.600 twice and we think three times oh my God 00:30:36.919 that was a lot that's nothing and when 00:30:39.360 we look at people who are expert 00:30:41.279 practicers I mean people artist level 00:30:43.640 performers there's there's never one 00:30:46.080 more time I mean there are always mult 00:30:48.600 many more times 00:30:50.399 yeah you you also uh used a quote that I 00:30:53.840 wrote down that said don't accept 00:30:55.720 anything less than the kid is capable of 00:30:57.960 all the student is capable of and I 00:31:00.039 think many times I think it's very easy 00:31:02.080 as teachers you know we've got a very 00:31:03.760 short amount of time generally uh we've 00:31:05.880 got lots of repertoire to cover and we 00:31:07.240 still want to do some improvising and we 00:31:08.639 want to do the oral skills and all that 00:31:10.440 yeah and so we do accept less than we 00:31:13.760 know that student is capable of so how 00:31:15.880 do we how do we take that time or 00:31:18.320 convince ourselves of the importance of 00:31:19.840 taking the time to get them to repeat 00:31:21.639 things many times and and to have those 00:31:23.559 discussions with them when we have such 00:31:25.240 little time yeah well I mean I I WR I 00:31:28.639 wrote an article once I don't know where 00:31:29.960 this was I remember where it was it a 00:31:32.639 long time ago the article was called to 00:31:34.440 too little time too much stuff you know 00:31:36.960 and I it's it times a zero some game so 00:31:41.000 if you're gonna do more of something you 00:31:42.519 have to do less of something else and I 00:31:44.440 think 00:31:45.440 we not just in music but but in schools 00:31:48.159 in 00:31:48.840 general make the unfortunate decision to 00:31:51.840 think well I can't I have to do all of 00:31:53.679 this you know I and I have to do all 00:31:56.320 this all the time 00:31:58.200 and actually we we don't you know I I 00:32:00.559 give a talk for probably probably the 00:32:02.399 last 25 years here at Texas I've been 00:32:04.880 here a very long time I I give the I 00:32:07.720 give the opening talk on teaching to the 00:32:09.559 new faculty I mean not just the music 00:32:11.000 school the whole the new faculty on our 00:32:13.840 campus Teach as well yeah oh yeah yeah 00:32:17.039 yeah so these are all faculty who are 00:32:18.840 you know I me I mean probably we hire I 00:32:21.200 don't know 120 150 faculty every every 00:32:25.440 year and so you know the president comes 00:32:27.279 and welcomes them to the university and 00:32:28.480 then I give a talk about teaching and 00:32:30.399 and and one of the things that uh that I 00:32:33.000 say during that talk because some of 00:32:34.880 these people are they just came out of a 00:32:36.760 post this is their first faculty 00:32:38.279 position and other people have been on a 00:32:39.679 faculty before and they're moving to UT 00:32:41.320 and that kind of thing but all the 00:32:43.120 younger faculty you know I say look 00:32:44.880 here's the thing you probably started 00:32:46.799 working on your syllabus and everything 00:32:48.039 put the content it look at the content 00:32:50.440 in your 00:32:51.320 syllabus take two-thirds of it and toss 00:32:54.600 it out you know like what do you you 00:32:58.080 crazy yeah I mean I mean I'm I'm 00:33:00.480 teaching first semester chemistry and my 00:33:02.639 department chair is teaching second 00:33:04.039 semester chemistry so if my student gets 00:33:06.559 a second semester and she doesn't know 00:33:08.639 something and the and my department 00:33:10.440 chair says who you take first semester 00:33:12.039 with and it's me you know then what and 00:33:14.200 what I assure them all is you know no 00:33:15.799 matter what you teaching first semester 00:33:17.279 that's gonna happen anyway so free 00:33:19.279 yourself from that burden of thinking 00:33:21.679 that if you cover all this stuff it's 00:33:23.000 going to be all in your students heads 00:33:24.559 because it's not and so well and what 00:33:27.480 you can do instead is think about how 00:33:30.480 can I focus on what are the essential 00:33:34.720 features of artistry or chemistry or 00:33:39.200 whatever it is and do those things so 00:33:42.600 often and in so many different contexts 00:33:45.080 that becomes what people think this 00:33:47.760 whole deal is about right so I mean if 00:33:50.399 you think about any kind of pianistic 00:33:52.399 skills I mean you certainly want to have 00:33:54.039 facility but what are you really 00:33:55.399 thinking about you're talking about 00:33:56.320 evenness of timing evenness of tone 00:33:59.559 connectedness of pitches whether you're 00:34:01.159 playing Legato or staccato there's a 00:34:03.399 sense of connectivity to what you're 00:34:04.720 doing you know okay you you can do that 00:34:08.399 all the time on on a lot of different 00:34:10.918 pieces right but if you're spending the 00:34:12.918 majority of your time just getting 00:34:15.239 through the notes just getting to where 00:34:17.159 you can you know get to from the 00:34:19.119 beginning to the end without stopping 00:34:20.520 you know and the metronomes on eight you 00:34:22.879 know because you can't play anywhere 00:34:24.800 close to 00:34:25.879 Tempo never going to get that sense of 00:34:28.119 that you know the student isn't going to 00:34:29.560 think the most important thing is this 00:34:31.679 little connection between those two 00:34:33.000 pitches right there to go from the G to 00:34:34.560 the a does that really sound like this 00:34:36.639 thing that happens I tell when you know 00:34:38.719 both both of my grandchildren when they 00:34:40.000 start playing 00:34:41.359 piano I I I would never teach anybody 00:34:44.280 piano because I'm I'm a I'm a I'll put 00:34:46.440 it this way I'm an enthusiastic pianist 00:34:48.639 so uh but but but what I would do when 00:34:51.719 it was time when they were old enough to 00:34:53.520 put their hand on a keyboard and strong 00:34:55.040 enough to push down a key I would just 00:34:57.520 put my right hand on on the piano and 00:34:59.880 put their hand an octave higher than 00:35:01.400 mine and I would do something with like 00:35:04.599 two or three pitches and ask them to 00:35:06.440 imitate it but notice we're only playing 00:35:09.280 two or three pitches so what I'm asking 00:35:11.480 to imitate is the 00:35:13.720 inflection I I I'm asking them to 00:35:18.960 go and then my little grandchild will go 00:35:21.040 you know be I said does that sound like 00:35:22.880 mine listen to mine 00:35:24.280 again you know and after and we're doing 00:35:26.680 this little tiny thing and when she got 00:35:29.200 to where she could actually go beat up 00:35:31.200 it's just like me that was like wow look 00:35:33.720 at that you know spectacular you know 00:35:36.960 and the thing is when that becomes the 00:35:38.640 goal right when you're really trying to 00:35:41.079 make something that's truly artistic and 00:35:44.200 expressive and beautiful then you can do 00:35:46.320 little things like that and take joy in 00:35:48.800 those little accomplishments you know 00:35:50.560 but if you're blowing through repertoire 00:35:53.240 because somebody told you you have to 00:35:54.800 you know and you never really Master 00:35:58.800 anything I'm not surprised that students 00:36:01.240 eventually say look I'm I'm done with 00:36:02.880 piano you know I I want to go play 00:36:04.760 soccer or what you know whatever they 00:36:06.040 want to do because it's not this isn't 00:36:07.920 gratifying to me you know I mean we we 00:36:10.640 like to do things that we find rewarding 00:36:13.920 and rewarding has to include a sense of 00:36:17.800 personal accomplishment you 00:36:20.000 know I was thinking too you we were 00:36:22.359 talking earlier on about comparison 00:36:23.839 getting a student to play something a 00:36:25.119 few times and compare them but as you've 00:36:27.359 mentioned too another great opportunity 00:36:29.200 is for us to play something and for them 00:36:31.680 to play something and ask them to 00:36:33.040 compare what was 00:36:34.560 different yeah I know I know you know I 00:36:38.000 I talked to a number of teachers who say 00:36:39.280 well I don't want to you know model too 00:36:40.640 much for my student because I want them 00:36:41.880 to have their own you 00:36:43.640 know play for your students I mean you 00:36:46.640 think about how often does a kid get to 00:36:49.599 sit next to a highly skilled pianist and 00:36:52.359 hear a piano played beautifully while 00:36:55.160 they're sitting right there I mean it's 00:36:57.720 spectacular you know and I I you know my 00:37:01.119 my thought is always I I want to play 00:37:03.200 for my students enough that they think 00:37:06.040 about boy I want to sound like that and 00:37:08.920 and because I'm right here and they're 00:37:10.240 right there you know I can convincingly 00:37:12.160 say I I can teach you to sound like that 00:37:14.319 you know you have to do some things to 00:37:16.119 get there but I can teach you to sound 00:37:17.800 just like that but rather than just sort 00:37:20.079 of saying that I can actually 00:37:21.800 demonstrate that by modeling myself 00:37:25.079 things that they're fully capable of 00:37:26.680 doing in a relatively short period of 00:37:28.160 time you know I remember having that 00:37:29.880 experience when I was studying for my 00:37:31.160 own performance diploma and watching 00:37:33.599 just watching sitting next to my teacher 00:37:35.160 performed these Works without just sight 00:37:37.319 reading the things I'm struggling at and 00:37:39.800 they were just beautiful and it did it 00:37:42.400 uh it really has such meaning to see 00:37:44.720 that and experience that yeah yeah it's 00:37:47.359 just I I mean it's a it's a it's a 00:37:49.440 lovely thing but you know I find the 00:37:50.760 same thing my undergraduate students 00:37:53.200 here are undergraduate students who are 00:37:54.800 going to teach in public schools and 00:37:56.000 teach Orchestra band and those kind 00:37:57.920 things I mean we we have to push them 00:38:01.000 because it's not common practice in the 00:38:03.680 US when you're a band director and 00:38:05.640 Orchestra director you don't play your 00:38:07.359 instrument you know you stand up there 00:38:08.640 with a baton and you talk and wave your 00:38:10.800 arms and stuff and I kind of spent all 00:38:12.760 these years learning to play the damn 00:38:13.960 trumpet play the trumpet you know I I 00:38:16.440 mean don't don't sit there talking to 00:38:18.319 people about what a phrase should sound 00:38:19.599 like just play it y I think we can we 00:38:22.640 can all shut our mouths more and play 00:38:25.440 more can't exactly sure we're all 00:38:28.240 Shockers for that as am I 00:38:30.760 yeah inevitable part of being a human 00:38:33.280 being that's true I remember doing uh 00:38:35.599 trying a silent lesson once that was an 00:38:37.520 incredibly challenging experience I 00:38:39.160 don't know if you've ever tried it or 00:38:40.280 with your oh yeah yeah sure just just to 00:38:43.040 actually not say a word unbelievably 00:38:45.240 difficult but but a really great 00:38:47.440 experience to look back 00:38:49.400 on um just a couple more questions Bob 00:38:53.440 um I I wrote down a quote when you were 00:38:55.880 speaking uh that has always resonated 00:38:58.920 and stuck with me and you said something 00:39:00.599 like kids who always look at their 00:39:03.240 teacher when they finish playing are 00:39:05.040 more likely to quit yeah and that that 00:39:08.079 just hit me in the face and I thought 00:39:10.079 wow okay this this is something that I 00:39:11.520 need to work on with my students can you 00:39:12.800 tell us a bit more about where this has 00:39:14.040 come from and and what suggestions you'd 00:39:15.520 have sure you know I I have to say you 00:39:18.920 know that's that's one experiment that 00:39:21.319 that looked at this so I you know I 00:39:23.160 wouldn't say I am absolutely certain at 00:39:25.880 this yep but the the the reason I sort 00:39:29.720 of you know latched on to that finding 00:39:32.040 and that study what was was this I you 00:39:37.040 know we all often have to ask ourselves 00:39:38.720 why why is anybody why are any of us 00:39:40.720 doing anything you know and I think you 00:39:44.280 know teaching music and learning music 00:39:46.359 is such there's such a mentorship 00:39:48.160 relationship you know it's like a master 00:39:50.119 Apprentice kind of thing and and I think 00:39:53.400 you know all of us who have had the 00:39:55.880 benefit of having wonderful teachers we 00:39:58.359 we do admire them and we do look up to 00:40:00.319 them and want to please them you know 00:40:02.440 and that kind of thing but I but I think 00:40:05.560 it's it's it's often the case that that 00:40:09.280 becomes the primary motivator for 00:40:12.040 students is making sure that their the 00:40:15.359 adults around them are happy with them 00:40:18.200 and I you know I I I get that I know how 00:40:21.040 that happens but I think that what it 00:40:24.640 what's required to be good at anything I 00:40:27.000 mean really good at it being good at 00:40:28.760 writing being good at you know painting 00:40:31.520 or playing the piano whereever it is and 00:40:34.240 individual has to be able to to to to 00:40:37.040 reinforce themselves and not just look 00:40:40.280 to other places to tell people how good 00:40:42.720 they are because you know you know you 00:40:44.560 think about how long you've been playing 00:40:45.640 playing the piano I think about how long 00:40:47.480 I've been playing music the reason I 00:40:49.800 love what I do is not because other 00:40:51.880 people tell me I'm good or because I win 00:40:54.480 something I mean people do tell me that 00:40:57.040 and I do win stuff but that's not why 00:40:58.400 I'm doing it that's just stuff that 00:40:59.760 happens because I'm good you know but 00:41:02.839 that would never be enough to motivate 00:41:05.400 me to do what I need to do to be really 00:41:08.040 good you know what I mean yes and I and 00:41:10.720 I think you know it's hard to get some 00:41:13.400 kids motivated to practice and and it's 00:41:15.319 easy to say well you know I I'll give 00:41:17.280 you this or I'll put a star on your 00:41:18.760 music and that kind of stuff that okay 00:41:20.680 fine I mean that stuff will get some 00:41:22.800 kids to do things but unless the kids 00:41:25.359 starts to take some personal pleasure in 00:41:28.280 their own accomplishment and they think 00:41:30.560 listen to what I just did that that was 00:41:32.280 spectacular you know I mean to 00:41:34.640 themselves then then then there's never 00:41:37.839 going to be enough of an impetus for 00:41:40.200 them to continue putting forth effort to 00:41:42.440 do what they need to do to be really 00:41:43.800 good right so yeah so there'll never be 00:41:46.319 enough stars or chocolates or whatever 00:41:47.839 it is or praise to keep them motivated 00:41:50.880 themselves and so this we're talking 00:41:52.319 motivation strategies here ar oh yeah 00:41:55.319 and and think you know I I mean when you 00:41:57.520 think about somebody I mean kids who are 00:42:01.359 you know almost literally addicted to a 00:42:04.480 video game and and you think you know 00:42:07.680 what no one's giving them anything for 00:42:10.240 that you know the there aren't you know 00:42:13.880 they may have some gold stars in the 00:42:15.319 game or something you know but I mean 00:42:17.000 there's no other person involved in this 00:42:19.520 they're just engaged in the game and and 00:42:22.680 and when they when they reach a new 00:42:24.800 level or they do whatever the game you 00:42:27.839 know whatever the game's goals are you 00:42:29.440 reach one of those goals it's like a big 00:42:31.000 deal because you reach a goal right but 00:42:33.559 but the there's there's a sense because 00:42:35.480 there's not an obvious you know human 00:42:37.440 involved controlling all all of this do 00:42:39.720 you think I did that you know I did that 00:42:42.800 and I'm I'm happy because I did that I'm 00:42:44.839 not happy because Mom likes it or be I 00:42:47.520 mean that's nice that Mom likes it you 00:42:49.200 know or that my teacher likes it but but 00:42:51.160 but I did that and and I like it enough 00:42:54.599 to make me want to do it some more 00:42:57.200 but if if if I never like it enough that 00:43:00.040 makes me want to do it some more and I 00:43:01.760 only like it enough that I have to get 00:43:03.520 some more stuff from somebody else 00:43:05.079 before I'm gonna do it some more I'm 00:43:06.520 never gonna persist at this so the 00:43:09.200 million-dollar question then how do we 00:43:12.319 convert the piano experience or any 00:43:14.520 instrument into the video game 00:43:16.200 experience are there are there any 00:43:18.000 tricks that you've learned about goal 00:43:19.760 setting or anything like that sure and 00:43:22.200 and it's and it's it's very much 00:43:24.280 connected to what we were just talking 00:43:25.920 about right uh earlier on in the podcast 00:43:28.760 and and that is setting goals that are 00:43:31.520 small 00:43:33.200 enough and and challenging 00:43:36.160 enough and doable enough that people 00:43:40.400 will work to accomplish you know I I've 00:43:42.599 started doing a thing when I did give 00:43:44.160 talks now I I I don't think I did this 00:43:45.680 when I was in Adela a couple couple 00:43:47.119 years ago but I I was just in uh I was 00:43:50.880 just giving the keynote at the Florida 00:43:53.000 mus music educators conference uh in 00:43:55.559 Tampa last month I don't know they 00:43:57.760 probably I don't know 2,000 people in 00:44:00.119 this big old crazy Hall you know and I 00:44:02.359 said here's what I want you to do we're 00:44:04.720 we're all gonna clap together once we're 00:44:08.040 just gonna clap once no you you did do 00:44:11.200 this that go go and explain it though 00:44:13.880 it's great yeah and you know and I got 00:44:15.839 all this room full of people and and and 00:44:18.640 I stopped them and said why are you 00:44:20.160 working so hard this this is this is a 00:44:22.440 stupid thing why why are you and and and 00:44:25.040 the features of it were 00:44:26.599 the goal was very clear each person in 00:44:29.640 that room was convinced that they could 00:44:31.000 do the goal and they were making 00:44:33.119 discriminations about when they got it 00:44:34.520 and when they did every learning 00:44:36.319 experience has to do that and every 00:44:38.599 every great video game does that you're 00:44:41.480 really clear about what the goal is 00:44:43.480 you're really clear about when you make 00:44:45.040 it and when you don't but you're 00:44:47.200 convinced that you're going to be able 00:44:48.160 to do it right so if you say you know 00:44:51.520 here's this sonata movement good luck 00:44:54.520 well I I don't know you know I don't 00:44:56.839 have a lot of confidence that I'm going 00:44:58.280 to be able to do that right but if if if 00:45:01.119 if you as a Pianist you know you're 00:45:03.720 you're teaching a jazz lesson and you 00:45:06.359 have this little cool turnaround in a 00:45:08.319 251 progression and I'm gonna teach you 00:45:10.119 to do this and we're just gonna do that 00:45:12.400 we're just gonna do this turnaround here 00:45:15.040 and and the and the kid actually learns 00:45:16.359 to do that around think that's really 00:45:18.559 cool you know I I got that and and you 00:45:21.680 don't you don't have to give me a pat on 00:45:23.319 the head or tell me you know I get a 00:45:25.079 gold start thing I'm just glad that I 00:45:26.559 can do that thing and I think that's 00:45:29.119 where the power of root teaching which 00:45:31.119 has become more and more popular 00:45:32.280 particularly with piano I don't know 00:45:33.400 about other instruments particularly in 00:45:35.359 those beginner first few months has 00:45:37.160 become uh a really important part of a 00:45:39.920 lot of teachers experience with their 00:45:41.440 students because bang you can just have 00:45:43.520 success they can sound cool and they're 00:45:45.680 winning very early on yeah and and and I 00:45:49.520 think you know I mean if you think about 00:45:52.079 the way we learn most of the things that 00:45:55.160 we learn 00:45:56.960 uh to do outside of school you know to 00:45:59.280 to ambulate to talk uh to manipulate 00:46:03.200 objects all that kind of stuff none of 00:46:06.680 that is done with explanations and 00:46:09.680 instructions it's all done by imitation 00:46:13.839 observation and you try to make you try 00:46:16.599 to do what this other person is doing 00:46:18.440 and and as you get better at noticing 00:46:20.920 and your teacher or parent or caregiver 00:46:23.640 helps you become better at noticing how 00:46:25.520 what I'm doing isn't quite like what 00:46:26.920 you're doing yet and maybe if you did 00:46:28.720 this it would look more like what I'm 00:46:29.880 doing that's how people learn to do 00:46:31.760 stuff you know and to say let's learn to 00:46:34.319 play the piano now look at this code up 00:46:36.920 here on the stand and we're gonna figure 00:46:39.240 out what all those dots mean I mean why 00:46:43.160 the argument that people make about why 00:46:44.680 you've got to do it that way damn it is 00:46:47.119 false you know I mean that if if you 00:46:49.040 don't start kids reading right away 00:46:51.559 they're they're never going to want to 00:46:52.599 learn to read that that is just nonsense 00:46:54.720 there is no evidence that that's the 00:46:56.319 case whatsoever now I'm not saying it's 00:46:58.599 not the case that some teacher who tried 00:47:00.760 to keep teach a kid by a road and now 00:47:03.200 the kid didn't want to to play music but 00:47:04.800 that's the teacher's fault it's not the 00:47:06.400 process's fault 00:47:08.520 right say that with love love no no it's 00:47:12.160 good it's no it's really good to hear 00:47:13.359 because uh I I've had a few people on 00:47:15.720 the podcast before when we've talked 00:47:17.079 about Road teaching my own uh beginner 00:47:19.359 teaching framework is very creative and 00:47:21.359 there's no reading for for months uh 00:47:23.839 it's all about just getting involved in 00:47:25.839 music copy play Sing improvise create 00:47:29.680 yeah that's the important stuff to me 00:47:31.319 and it sounds like you would tend to 00:47:32.680 agree oh yeah yeah well I 00:47:35.079 mean I heartily agree I I I I mean you 00:47:38.319 know if you think about what most people 00:47:41.280 imagine when you tell a kid you're GNA 00:47:44.119 learn to play the piano or you're gonna 00:47:46.319 learn to play a trumpet or the drums or 00:47:49.680 whatever what what they're imagining is 00:47:52.319 is actually playing the thing you know 00:47:55.079 and actually doing things that sound to 00:47:57.119 them like the music they already know 00:48:00.640 I'm not talking about popular music 00:48:01.880 versus I'm not talking about that at all 00:48:03.880 but sound like music there are phrases 00:48:05.920 there are gestures there are expressive 00:48:08.480 intentions that come across because of 00:48:10.119 what you do and and when you start with 00:48:12.440 that right when you start with what 00:48:14.720 music is for which is to convey things 00:48:17.800 to other human 00:48:18.960 beings well now You' now you've got them 00:48:21.960 right I I mean I I mean I and listen I I 00:48:25.400 give lot of talks for teachers in The 00:48:27.280 Sciences as well as in the Arts and you 00:48:30.160 know I walk into a lot of science 00:48:31.800 classrooms I see a lot of kids are busy 00:48:34.480 you they're active because somebody said 00:48:36.200 Active Learning is good okay fine but I 00:48:39.000 don't see anything in the room that 00:48:40.000 looks like science you know even though 00:48:42.079 it's a science classroom they're not 00:48:44.040 doing the things that scientists do that 00:48:46.319 make them love the fact that they're 00:48:47.559 scientists right they're doing stuff 00:48:49.880 they're following these procedures that 00:48:51.400 somebody else gave them to get to this 00:48:52.920 answer and somehow that's supposed to 00:48:54.839 teach them something that maybe it does 00:48:57.079 and maybe it doesn't but if if you start 00:49:00.440 to think about why why do I do this you 00:49:02.559 know why do I play the piano think well 00:49:05.400 this is why I play the piano so why 00:49:06.839 shouldn't I create as many experiences I 00:49:08.559 can so my students get to do that and 00:49:11.200 not assuming they have to suffer for 00:49:13.599 many 00:49:15.079 years to get there yeah and if they can 00:49:17.960 stick it out baby then they'll get to do 00:49:20.280 something you know beautiful in the end 00:49:22.720 yeah uh Bob it's a a great great note to 00:49:26.160 finish up on I did want to mention uh 00:49:28.040 you've got a fantastic book out there 00:49:29.760 it's called intelligent music teaching 00:49:32.000 uh in that book do you cover similar 00:49:33.839 things to what we've been talking about 00:49:34.960 today I do yeah I I I mean I you know 00:49:38.440 that I I wrote that as a collection of 00:49:40.480 essays uh for a class that I was 00:49:43.799 teaching and I I I I sort of thought 00:49:46.520 about well what what would I like my 00:49:49.319 students to think about when they're 00:49:51.119 organizing their own teaching and what 00:49:52.799 they're what they're doing when they're 00:49:54.400 planning in uh in in instruction for 00:49:56.920 their own students and uh intelligent 00:49:59.000 music teaching it's been out it's hard 00:50:00.400 for me to believe it's it's about 18 00:50:02.599 years old now it's gone through I don't 00:50:04.280 know this his 20th printing or something 00:50:06.559 that's just crazy I never imagin you 00:50:08.240 know it's still a very popular book 00:50:09.839 which makes me happy uh and and I and I 00:50:12.880 think you know many 00:50:14.480 teachers who have gone through pedagogy 00:50:17.480 instruction you know if you look about 00:50:19.400 what what most pedagogy is about it's 00:50:22.559 really about they talk about repertoire 00:50:24.480 and sequencing of repertoire you know 00:50:26.119 you do these pieces first and then this 00:50:27.920 is this is going to prepare you for this 00:50:29.200 set and that's kind of the way it goes 00:50:31.400 and this book isn't about any of that 00:50:33.400 it's really about how human beings 00:50:35.559 interact with one another with the goal 00:50:37.920 of helping one of those human beings to 00:50:39.440 learn to do something new that's great 00:50:43.200 uh and I think that's available on 00:50:44.280 Amazon if people are interested it is 00:50:46.240 yeah yeah fantastic and where can people 00:50:48.000 find out more about you and uh the 00:50:49.760 lectures and workshops and things that 00:50:51.559 you're involved in great well I I I have 00:50:53.880 a a a center for Music Learning here at 00:50:56.480 the University of Texas at Austin and uh 00:50:58.480 if you just Google Center for Music 00:50:59.799 Learning you'll you'll find that there 00:51:01.440 are a lot of materials there a lot of it 00:51:03.559 just free things to look at there's a 00:51:05.960 wonderful uh section of the site called 00:51:08.079 the nature of expertise where there are 00:51:09.760 videos of really superb uh artist level 00:51:13.960 teachers teaching students uh and one of 00:51:16.559 those artists is uh Nita true so all the 00:51:19.400 N true fans out there can watch Nita 00:51:21.319 teaching her own students and it's a 00:51:22.880 different thing right because when you 00:51:23.960 watch a Master Class you know the 00:51:25.960 relationship's a little bit odd because 00:51:27.520 teachers know the stent and vice versa 00:51:29.079 but this is like these people working 00:51:30.440 with their own students and you kind of 00:51:31.760 see that uh they they let me invade 00:51:34.319 their privacy for a couple of weeks 00:51:36.760 so Cent mus learning yeah it's I mean 00:51:40.720 watching other teachers teach I think is 00:51:42.119 one of the best things to do which is 00:51:43.520 why I enjoyed watching you on stage and 00:51:45.920 uh why we've got lots of videos in in 00:51:47.799 our membership as well about with other 00:51:49.559 teachers teaching I think it's a great 00:51:50.960 way to learn so Bob thank you so much 00:51:52.880 for your time I know to Sunday afternoon 00:51:54.200 and you've very kindly given it to to us 00:51:55.880 uh it's been fantastic to connect with 00:51:57.280 you thanks you bet it's been a real 00:51:58.640

great little 00:52:24.280 ideas that you can take away and try out 00:52:27.160 and as you heard I've tried a number of 00:52:29.079 his ideas that I've got at previous 00:52:30.559 conferences where

00:04:01.200 think it was two years ago now because 00:04:02.840 we've got our next one coming up middle 00:04:04.079 of this year and look I thoroughly 00:04:05.680 enjoyed all your sessions you did a 00:04:07.319 couple of Keynotes and you also did 00:04:08.959 something that I love doing when I 00:04:10.319 present workshops which is actually 00:04:11.920 teach students live so I wondered what 00:04:15.680 what do you hope uh teachers get when 00:04:17.639 they see you in action on the stage 00:04:19.519 teaching another student what are some 00:04:21.040 of the things that you hope they pick 00:04:23.080 up well you know I I've been thinking 00:04:25.520 over the past couple years in particular 00:04:27.759 about the idea of how important noticing 00:04:31.120 is not only as on the part of the 00:04:33.520 teacher but helping students and 00:04:35.520 Learners learn to notice what's going on 00:04:38.479 as well and uh you know I I think often 00:04:41.400 when people work with students who are 00:04:43.680 working on whatever skills they're 00:04:45.240 trying to master uh the the chunks of 00:04:49.280 material that they work on at any given 00:04:51.479 moment are so large and have so many 00:04:54.120 parts to them it's very difficult 00:04:55.960 oftentimes for both teacher and student 00:04:58.759 to really know notice the Small Things 00:05:01.800 uh that are taking place and you know I 00:05:03.320 mean it's it I'm sure this is such a 00:05:06.479 hacking phrase anymore you know but it's 00:05:08.000 the little things that make things great 00:05:10.440 you know and I think lots of times 00:05:12.800 especially you know people who are 00:05:14.160 impatient and trying to get through 00:05:15.360 things fast and trying to cover a lot of 00:05:17.080 material in a short period of time it's 00:05:19.479 easy to overlook the small features of 00:05:22.120 whatever is you're working on that 00:05:23.720 really lead to something being refined 00:05:26.520 and 00:05:27.400 beautiful yeah I I agree that was one 00:05:29.720 thing that I really did pick up was the 00:05:31.919 uh care and attention with which you 00:05:34.840 gave every little bit of a students's 00:05:37.600 work and whereas I tend to work much 00:05:40.560 more on bigger picture things with 00:05:41.800 students and gloss over those little 00:05:44.039 details sometimes which I'm sure many 00:05:45.639 teachers do you the point you made was 00:05:48.400 actually going into depth on one thing 00:05:50.759 and getting it beautiful and perfect and 00:05:53.360 how the student would like it to be S to 00:05:55.720 sound that was the thing that you really 00:05:57.520 focused on which is what stuck with me 00:05:59.840 actually um and I think you had you had 00:06:01.960 a mantra of making little things great 00:06:04.600 versus making a lot of things better so 00:06:07.840 tell us about this Mantra of 00:06:10.360 yours well you know I actually that that 00:06:13.280 that Mantra comes from the human brain 00:06:15.840 actually you know I mean if you think 00:06:17.800 about what's required to learn anything 00:06:21.479 about a skill I mean the kind of memory 00:06:23.440 that that we refer to as procedural 00:06:25.680 memories memories for how to do things 00:06:28.080 the part of your brain that that stores 00:06:29.800 those memories and activates those 00:06:31.240 memories is not amenable to verbal 00:06:34.759 instruction you know and and we know 00:06:36.680 this about everything we try to do you 00:06:38.120 know we we can't just talk ourselves 00:06:40.319 into playing more evenly or you know 00:06:43.440 more quickly or whatever we have to do 00:06:45.039 ourselves into that you know yeah and 00:06:47.639 and I think one of the things that 00:06:48.800 happens is you think what would what 00:06:51.039 would signal the brain that this is 00:06:53.000 something that it should store or update 00:06:55.599 right and the more you're trying to do 00:06:58.080 at one time the 00:07:00.599 more confusing it is about what about 00:07:04.360 any practice trial is something to be 00:07:06.800 retained and and I think the other thing 00:07:08.599 is too you know when when 00:07:10.479 we're reinforced by the accomplishment 00:07:13.120 of a goal that reinforcement even makes 00:07:16.759 it more likely that we what whatever we 00:07:18.840 just did is going to become a lasting 00:07:20.720 part of our memory that's going to be 00:07:22.000 retrievable in the future and actually 00:07:24.879 to to just get better at something I 00:07:26.879 mean you're moving in the right 00:07:27.800 direction I mean certainly that this 00:07:29.479 there's something reinforcing about that 00:07:30.639 if you recognize your own progress but 00:07:32.639 when you really do it when all the parts 00:07:34.800 of your body are functioning the way 00:07:36.840 they're supposed to and the sound that 00:07:38.479 you're going for actually comes out the 00:07:40.520 way you intended it to come out that 00:07:43.039 creates a lasting memory in a way that 00:07:45.639 just you know small bits of progress 00:07:48.120 over a wide landscape of goals just 00:07:51.000 doesn't do right so you're actually 00:07:52.919 saying that we can tell our brains and 00:07:55.400 therefore our students brains what to 00:07:58.199 store and remember and ingrain better if 00:08:02.159 we focus down on sing simple single 00:08:04.840 things yeah and and this is not to take 00:08:07.440 away from the value in looking at Big 00:08:10.240 Picture things as well you know I I mean 00:08:12.400 what's what's interesting to my 00:08:13.840 colleagues and and me and we've been 00:08:16.080 looking at a lot of people who are 00:08:18.400 really experts in their discipline not 00:08:20.599 just in music but in other areas as well 00:08:21.960 and looking at how they practice and 00:08:24.159 when we talk to and observe really 00:08:27.159 artist level performers 00:08:29.800 um they they do have a big picture goal 00:08:32.719 in mind I mean there the the expressive 00:08:36.000 capacity whether it's playing the piano 00:08:38.080 or playing the guitar or whatever the 00:08:39.440 instrument happens to be they they are 00:08:41.799 expressive intentions sort of Define 00:08:44.839 what the physical goals need to be right 00:08:47.240 because if I'm going to make this this 00:08:49.080 line sound beautiful and languid and 00:08:51.920 calm well there are certain things that 00:08:53.800 have to happen physically to pull that 00:08:55.360 off right but to only working on the 00:08:58.040 physical things and not having also in 00:09:00.320 your mind what that expressive goal is I 00:09:03.680 think often takes away from uh the 00:09:07.959 ability to prioritize okay where should 00:09:10.320 I devote that attention to small things 00:09:13.120 because I don't really have an idea of 00:09:14.519 the big picture of what I'm going for 00:09:16.279 yeah that makes sense and so what kind 00:09:18.640 of language do you recommend teachers 00:09:20.720 use in order to distill and and try and 00:09:23.920 get students to really focus on one 00:09:26.120 single thing so student plays a line 00:09:28.360 what what do we say at end because we 00:09:30.120 often get that wrong I put my hand up 00:09:31.839 and say oh that was great every time 00:09:34.000 it's like that was really not great yeah 00:09:36.079 yeah yeah what Lang what's your 00:09:38.000 suggestion there well well I I I don't 00:09:40.360 think it has to do necessarily with what 00:09:42.519 we say but in another way I think it has 00:09:45.040 to do with what we ask in terms of what 00:09:47.959 we ask our students about what they do 00:09:49.720 you know I I I find that you know what 00:09:52.839 typically happens in school and this 00:09:54.399 isn't just a music thing this is a 00:09:55.480 school thing I'm a teacher I ask you to 00:09:57.440 do something you do it and I tell you 00:09:59.320 how you how you did and we go on the 00:10:00.640 next thing you know that's kind of like 00:10:01.959 the the drill that's not an effective 00:10:04.760 way to learn and if you think about how 00:10:06.600 how people how all of us learn in 00:10:09.200 informal settings that's so we're not in 00:10:11.120 school that we're not being taught we're 00:10:13.320 just kind of learning something whether 00:10:14.800 it's you know how to play a game on our 00:10:17.600 phone or how to find a find our way in a 00:10:20.360 new city or something like that there 00:10:22.760 there are certain features of that 00:10:23.959 learning that are really important and 00:10:26.480 and one of them is being cognizant of 00:10:29.839 our own error making I mean I think what 00:10:32.920 happens often times when we're teachers 00:10:35.079 we we we hear what's going on and often 00:10:36.880 we hear more about what's going on than 00:10:38.519 our students do so we're quick to inform 00:10:40.959 them by telling them what's happening 00:10:42.839 and what they need to be paying 00:10:43.760 attention to but I think what what what 00:10:45.880 what advantages a lot of Young Learners 00:10:47.519 and older Learners too for that 00:10:49.200 matter is by teachers asking students 00:10:52.760 about what they hear and what they feel 00:10:54.920 what what they're doing now all of us 00:10:56.959 have had plenty of students if we say 00:10:58.440 well would just think about that student 00:11:00.399 say well I don't 00:11:01.959 know you know I mean so but but but I 00:11:05.000 have a really good solution to that 00:11:07.079 problem and that is to ask students to 00:11:09.600 play things more than one time and ask 00:11:12.600 them to compare and explain how they 00:11:15.440 were different because none of us is 00:11:17.680 really capable of doing two things in a 00:11:19.560 row that are absolutely identical so 00:11:22.200 when we when we do you know a small 00:11:24.120 phrase or or something we have somebody 00:11:25.880 play that we say could you do that like 00:11:27.760 three times and tell me how those three 00:11:30.000 times are different well now what you've 00:11:31.800 done is you've switched on a listening 00:11:34.360 mode in the student that often isn't 00:11:37.040 there because they're in a doing mode 00:11:38.399 you know I'm I'm pushing I'm making sure 00:11:41.360 my foot's on the pedal do doing but I'm 00:11:43.120 not really listening to what I'm doing 00:11:44.880 and to make judgments to getting 00:11:46.639 students to make judgments about what 00:11:48.120 they do because of course that's what we 00:11:49.240 want them to do when they practice right 00:11:51.040 but if when they're in the lesson we're 00:11:52.560 making all the judgments and we're doing 00:11:54.240 all the explaining and we're doing all 00:11:55.920 the feedback about what's going on and 00:11:57.360 not really inviting them into that 00:11:59.880 process then I think we we miss a lot of 00:12:03.440 opportunities to change the way students 00:12:05.880 think about what they do you know 00:12:07.600 there's a really interesting uh 00:12:09.480 philosopher who teaches a tus named 00:12:11.200 Daniel Dennis he's written a lot of 00:12:12.600 things about Ai and and different kind 00:12:14.519 kind of things but I I was on a 00:12:16.760 conference program with him last summer 00:12:18.399 and and he was able to he came up with 00:12:20.720 this succinct phrase that expresses 00:12:22.760 something that I've talked about for a 00:12:23.920 long time and it's a difference between 00:12:26.079 between competence and comprehension 00:12:29.880 uh and it's really interesting a lot of 00:12:32.079 what we do in school we teach people to 00:12:34.480 be competent we teach students how to do 00:12:36.399 certain things I'm just talking about 00:12:37.519 physical things I'm talking about you 00:12:38.519 know 00:12:39.519 mathematical equations that kind St but 00:12:42.800 it's possible to be competent and not 00:12:44.519 really know what you're doing I mean 00:12:46.079 it's possible to get the right answer 00:12:48.240 and not really understand what you're 00:12:49.760 what you're what what you're doing and 00:12:51.560 and to me that's the great joy of 00:12:54.720 teaching is not just affecting the way 00:12:57.680 somebody behaves 00:12:59.560 but affecting the way they think about 00:13:01.279 what how how they behave you know which 00:13:02.959 is which is a a subtly but importantly 00:13:05.320 different thing absolutely you mentioned 00:13:08.320 the University was it toughs or 00:13:09.920 something that TS T tuu FTS in Boston 00:13:14.199 right toughs okay and the name of the 00:13:15.920 person because I know people love 00:13:17.120 researching Dan Daniel dennet d n NE TT 00:13:21.839 fantastic his most his his his most 00:13:24.360 recent book is called from bacteria to 00:13:27.000 Bach and Back Again so well got be 00:13:30.839 captured with the title alone EXA right 00:13:33.440 you know yeah so just going back one 00:13:36.600 step but I think one key takeaway that 00:13:38.800 teachers could try with their students 00:13:40.360 from as a result of listening to this 00:13:41.920 would be that idea of uh rather than 00:13:44.519 just jumping in and giving a response 00:13:47.000 one yes we could just ask them questions 00:13:49.279 about how they played things but as we 00:13:51.279 all know sometimes they're too worried 00:13:53.199 about playing to be listening to 00:13:54.639 anything they're doing and I remember 00:13:56.279 asking my student once I said after 00:13:58.759 afterwards ah so how how how' that go 00:14:01.759 can you give you a mark give yourself a 00:14:03.000 mark out of 10 uh and he's he's like no 00:14:06.079 I don't know and I said you were you 00:14:07.920 actually listening to what you're doing 00:14:09.079 and he said no I don't think so yeah 00:14:11.959 right exactly so your solution here is 00:14:14.399 to actually say rather than rather than 00:14:16.519 that actually upfront say okay I would 00:14:18.800 like you to actually play this phrase 00:14:20.720 three times in a row uh with a pause 00:14:23.000 between each and I want you to at the 00:14:25.920 end of that I'd like you to compare how 00:14:27.440 they went what are some of the 00:14:28.320 differences between them yeah and what 00:14:30.920 and what's really interesting to me 00:14:32.600 about that Tim is that students who are 00:14:35.000 normally very reticent to say anything 00:14:37.079 about what they're doing are much more 00:14:39.160 forthcoming when asked to compare 00:14:41.480 multiple iterations of the same thing 00:14:43.920 you know it's it's like you know if 00:14:46.560 you're sitting in a room full of people 00:14:47.639 and you point to some person say what do 00:14:49.279 you think about that shirt well I don't 00:14:51.560 know what I don't know what am I 00:14:52.639 supposed to say I mean what color it is 00:14:54.040 or whether it fits I you know I don't 00:14:55.560 know but if you say look at that shirt 00:14:57.240 and look at that shirt and tell me how 00:14:59.360 they're different well now I've got all 00:15:01.079 kinds of things to say right so that 00:15:03.839 that comparative judgment is and I want 00:15:06.000 to add one more thing about the asking 00:15:07.360 questions thing and I've been on this 00:15:09.399 kick now for about a a year and a half 00:15:12.000 I'm I'm very fond of it I I may be too 00:15:13.839 fond of it but I but I I think it really 00:15:15.639 has some some Merit and that is you know 00:15:17.839 when we ask people to comment on what 00:15:20.079 they do I think a natural tendency or at 00:15:23.480 least a tendency that's been ingrained 00:15:25.480 in people throughout school is to 00:15:27.800 express things in terms of an evaluative 00:15:30.120 judgment so we say well tell me what you 00:15:32.120 liked and what you didn't like about 00:15:33.199 what just happened you know tell me what 00:15:34.480 was positive what was negative about 00:15:35.639 what you just heard I mean that kind of 00:15:37.079 thing and I've I've you know in a way 00:15:40.639 that I'm sure many of my students find 00:15:42.279 annoying try to expunge that way of 00:15:44.759 asking questions from their language and 00:15:46.800 asking the question said what did you 00:15:48.319 notice about what just 00:15:50.000 happened I don't want you to tell me 00:15:51.639 whether it's good or bad we like that I 00:15:53.279 I don't care I just want to know what 00:15:54.759 you noticed and what's interesting to me 00:15:57.160 and I I I'm actually doing two two 00:15:58.839 experiments about this now but I don't 00:15:59.959 have the data yet but I'll tell you how 00:16:01.639 I want the data to come out right is is 00:16:04.759 that when people are are asked what they 00:16:07.800 notice without having to make an 00:16:09.279 evaluative Judgment at the front end you 00:16:11.600 know I'm not going to tell you whether 00:16:12.639 you liked it or whether you thought it 00:16:13.519 was good just what did you notice that 00:16:16.000 people are actually more forthcoming 00:16:17.639 right they they actually have more to 00:16:19.079 say because that you've taken out the 00:16:20.959 idea that you have to evaluate this and 00:16:23.399 rate it before you can say anything you 00:16:25.839 know and of course most of us are 00:16:27.160 loathed to say especially about some 00:16:28.720 else's performance well that was really 00:16:30.519 terrible you the scale of one to 10 that 00:16:32.240 was a two so but when you start saying 00:16:34.199 well you know I noticed that that that 00:16:35.920 the [ __ ] at the end it it's maybe it's 00:16:38.519 slowed down more than than I would have 00:16:40.360 slowed down well now okay I'm just 00:16:42.440 describing what I see in here I'm not 00:16:44.240 I'm not making evaluations I'm just 00:16:45.600 describing what I what I what I see in 00:16:47.600 here and I find that many young teachers 00:16:50.600 who because of just their social 00:16:52.279 practice in typical social interactions 00:16:54.199 aren't used to giving negative feedback 00:16:56.399 to their friends unless they're angry 00:16:58.519 you know that that being able to just 00:17:00.360 describe what you see and hear many 00:17:03.040 people are more comfortable talking 00:17:05.640 about what needs to be called attention 00:17:07.240 to just because they're not making an 00:17:08.679 evaluative 00:17:09.760 judgment and uh so suppose we could do 00:17:12.839 that uh for ourselves as well in our own 00:17:15.400 teaching even uh after a lesson what did 00:17:18.439 I notice happened to that lesson 00:17:19.919 particularly when things went 00:17:20.720 particularly well or or badly perhaps 00:17:23.160 but I also think yeah just just throwing 00:17:24.520 that question out there that makes a lot 00:17:25.599 of sense another great tip that we could 00:17:27.439 all try straight away what did you 00:17:29.520 notice about that first four bars that 00:17:32.559 you you've been working so hard on what 00:17:34.039 did you notice about it today I like it 00:17:35.520 thank you rob that's great um now just 00:17:39.280 and I just wanted to reiterate too you 00:17:40.559 were talking about competence versus 00:17:43.039 comprehension and uh and I in my own 00:17:46.120 teaching one of the things that I really 00:17:48.559 love doing with students is diving into 00:17:50.480 the chords and the harmony of any pretty 00:17:52.280 much any work that they're learning 00:17:53.840 because to me again they could play all 00:17:56.280 of that read the music do what the 00:17:58.720 composer says on the page but to 00:18:00.840 actually understand that actually this 00:18:02.440 is a 12 BBL structure or this is just 00:18:04.760 moving between 1 and four and five and 00:18:06.480 oh there's a Cadence at the end and how 00:18:08.159 that works that sort of thing can be 00:18:10.080 really pulled apart by looking into 00:18:11.520 things like Harmony are there any other 00:18:14.120 examples of that kind of more 00:18:16.200 comprehension based activities that 00:18:18.600 you've seen work well I you know I think 00:18:21.559 a lot of that has to do I mean often and 00:18:24.240 this is this is true in universities and 00:18:26.000 conservatories too you know people take 00:18:28.400 Theory class that's over there you know 00:18:30.520 and then they go take their performance 00:18:32.640 lessons and you know they take a music 00:18:34.080 history class and very seldom or less Le 00:18:38.240 should does all that stuff get put 00:18:39.559 together right I you know when when when 00:18:43.600 people are approaching a new piece of 00:18:45.360 music there there's actually actually 00:18:47.559 value in knowing where this music came 00:18:49.799 from and what other music was in in in 00:18:54.720 Vogue at the time and what people were 00:18:56.400 listening to and what came before this 00:18:58.159 and what was sort of unusual about this 00:19:00.640 piece that a composer hadn't written 00:19:02.799 before or and so so that now becomes 00:19:06.280 part of being an intelligent Music Maker 00:19:09.000 right is that you know things like that 00:19:10.600 and I think the same thing can be said 00:19:11.919 for the structure of the piece too I 00:19:13.480 mean like you say you know what the 00:19:15.760 harmonic structure is you know what a a 00:19:20.000 a a more rapid harmonic Rhythm does to 00:19:23.640 the feeling of a piece that a slower 00:19:25.440 harmonic Rhythm wouldn't do and to be 00:19:27.720 able to think about music in those terms 00:19:30.840 I I I I think when when when students 00:19:33.280 start to see that those things inform 00:19:36.080 your musical decisionmaking you know why 00:19:38.480 would you take more time there and not 00:19:40.520 just well I feel it you know I mean okay 00:19:42.720 fine but I but I mean are there are 00:19:44.520 there reasons why you should do 00:19:46.760 something you know why why you should 00:19:48.200 take more time or or change the the 00:19:50.880 loudness level that you're playing 00:19:52.080 something like that that's related to 00:19:54.400 the structure of the music and and and 00:19:57.320 to me when you invite students into all 00:19:59.679 of that it it it makes playing a musical 00:20:03.080 instrument all that more interesting I 00:20:04.880 I'm not just you know this isn't some 00:20:06.559 calisthenic exercise that I'm doing you 00:20:08.840 know I'm I actually have an 00:20:11.080 understanding of music that the average 00:20:12.760 person doesn't have and that's what 00:20:14.760 leads me to make decisions about what I 00:20:16.480 do 00:20:17.280 musically and making connections as you 00:20:19.400 say so so important for deepening the 00:20:21.559 understanding but also just making it 00:20:22.919 relevant for students too why am I 00:20:25.039 studying this you know history over here 00:20:27.559 and Theory let's yeah put all together 00:20:29.880 yeah I totally agree well and I you know 00:20:32.039 and I think it's I mean to me it's it's 00:20:34.520 cooler to know what's going on than not 00:20:37.200 and I think all the people who say you 00:20:38.679 know I'm kind of bored with this you 00:20:40.679 know the reason they're bored is because 00:20:42.320 it's not connected to anything you know 00:20:44.200 I do this thing you know I'm writing out 00:20:46.039 these scales and modes and yeah fine you 00:20:48.200 know but there's not it's not really 00:20:49.960 connected to the things that I listen to 00:20:52.360 the things that I'm trying to do on my 00:20:54.200 own on my on my instrument and that 00:20:57.080 connectedness is what makes makes it 00:20:58.520 actually engaging and 00:21:00.679 motivating you talk a lot about the 00:21:02.640 brain in your books and presentations as 00:21:04.559 well and and you mentioned before 00:21:05.840 retrieval I think was one of the words 00:21:07.360 you used and I've heard that used before 00:21:09.480 in uh practice in regard to uh breaking 00:21:13.559 up your practice into smaller segments 00:21:15.679 having breaks from it and coming back 00:21:17.200 and having to pull that knowledge back 00:21:18.799 out of your brain makes things stronger 00:21:21.159 um I don't know if I've summarize that 00:21:22.480 very well but can you tell us more about 00:21:24.760 uh that importance for us as teachers 00:21:27.120 when we're working improving students 00:21:29.000 practice Yeah well you know I I I I I 00:21:32.640 have a good short example that kind of 00:21:34.679 makes this it has to do with like 00:21:35.880 memorizing music I mean everybody you 00:21:37.720 know especially pianist that's sort of 00:21:39.360 an expectation sometimes that piano 00:21:40.720 gonna memorize their music Pro all that 00:21:42.760 kind of thing and that's the bane of 00:21:44.880 many people's existence because it's you 00:21:46.400 know intimidating and people forget and 00:21:48.559 oh my God and all that kind of stuff but 00:21:50.400 here's the thing in fact just talk about 00:21:51.960 my undergraduate class about this a 00:21:53.520 couple weeks ago so I had them do this 00:21:55.720 thing and I asked them to write down the 00:21:57.120 sequence of this that we were playing 00:21:59.120 soprano recorders in my class and I had 00:22:00.880 introduced them to some things and we 00:22:02.200 were playing together and I asked him to 00:22:03.400 write down the sequence of what we had 00:22:04.679 just done and that was on a Friday when 00:22:07.240 they came back on Monday I asked them to 00:22:10.480 get out piece of paper and see if they 00:22:12.559 could remember the sequence and write it 00:22:14.200 down again and then I asked the question 00:22:17.360 if I wanted you to remember this next 00:22:20.400 Friday would it be better to do what we 00:22:22.600 did today and have you try to remember 00:22:24.200 what happened last Friday or to do what 00:22:26.240 we did last Friday again today 00:22:28.840 and the intuitive answer would bew be 00:22:31.000 better just to do it again but actually 00:22:33.200 that's not what we be better what would 00:22:34.640 be better is trying to remember it and 00:22:37.360 that would make the memory the 00:22:38.760 subsequent Friday better now that's a 00:22:41.120 non-intuitive thing because you think 00:22:42.559 boy just keep doing this and a more I do 00:22:44.480 it damn it it's gonna get in there and 00:22:45.919 then I'll be actually that's not what 00:22:47.320 happens because what you're not 00:22:48.960 practicing is getting it out of your 00:22:51.720 memory and that's what retrieval 00:22:53.600 practice is all about right it's not 00:22:55.799 about how stuff gets in I mean that's 00:22:58.799 not trivial OB obviously but the big 00:23:01.360 deal is how do you practice getting it 00:23:03.559 out how do you practice remembering and 00:23:06.279 recalling things because that's going to 00:23:09.039 determine how memorable things are in 00:23:10.640 the future so you were asking about 00:23:12.000 breaking up your practice into smaller 00:23:13.919 chunks I mean what one of the things 00:23:15.520 that's interesting about that if if if 00:23:17.600 you practice for an hour in a day and 00:23:20.440 let's say you're working on one 00:23:21.559 particular thing for that hour by the 00:23:24.600 end of that hour if if you're practicing 00:23:26.640 well you're probably doing pretty well 00:23:28.279 with this 00:23:29.279 thing and most of us misperceive that 00:23:32.760 how we're doing at the end of the hour 00:23:34.720 is now how we do it all the time right 00:23:37.480 not recognizing that it took us an hour 00:23:39.640 to get to that right so if I practiced 00:23:43.679 like that not only am I taking an hour 00:23:46.919 to ramp up to whatever is my goal is and 00:23:50.000 not recognize that it takes me an hour 00:23:51.520 to get there I'm now overestimating how 00:23:54.600 well I know this right because at the 00:23:57.039 end of an hour it's pretty good you 00:23:59.200 right so if I break that up into three 00:24:01.120 20 minute things throughout the day at 00:24:03.520 the end of 20 minutes you know I get it 00:24:05.320 wherever I get it and when I come back 00:24:07.520 then for the next 20 minutes I forgot 00:24:10.799 some of what happened in the 20 minutes 00:24:12.600 that I practiced before and I have to 00:24:14.679 retrieve that again right and that 00:24:17.120 happens again in the third 20 minutes so 00:24:19.320 what I'm practicing in all of those 00:24:20.799 times that little scalop learning thing 00:24:22.679 it's going like this you know I I I 00:24:24.520 learn something I get pretty good and 00:24:26.399 then I step away from it and I forget 00:24:28.279 some of that and I come back and I have 00:24:29.799 to recall it again that's what's 00:24:32.440 actually making that memory going to 00:24:34.039 persist longer into the future than it 00:24:36.640 will if I just spend you know hours at a 00:24:38.720 time just banging on the same thing 00:24:40.760 right has the research been done on this 00:24:43.120 uh Bob yeah a ton right 00:24:47.600 great yeah I mean I mean the thing is 00:24:50.679 you know we talk a lot about so-called 00:24:53.679 muscle memory you know and I and really 00:24:57.840 I don't know what people actually mean 00:24:59.159 by that but I think what they mean by 00:25:00.640 that is somehow our motor system is 00:25:02.240 remembering this in a way that we can't 00:25:04.720 consciously uh access you know of course 00:25:07.640 it's not in our muscles it's all in our 00:25:09.600 brain right so so the memory isn't 00:25:11.799 really in our muscles but but but our 00:25:13.480 motor system can run out a sequence of 00:25:15.520 things that happens pretty regularly and 00:25:18.000 do it pretty 00:25:19.240 reliably until we don't and then we 00:25:22.559 realize we can't access it right because 00:25:24.080 I'm in the middle of this thing and now 00:25:26.039 for whatever reason I forgot 00:25:28.480 and I don't have the sweep and the 00:25:30.919 momentum of doing the movement that's 00:25:33.240 allowing my fingers just to go on their 00:25:35.799 own now I have to really remember was 00:25:37.600 that an A 00:25:38.840 flat and now I'm screwed right I I I I 00:25:43.000 really haven't known for a long time 00:25:44.880 whether it's an A flat I just been doing 00:25:46.679 this thing and I know it sounds right 00:25:48.080 and whatever you know we all yeah so so 00:25:51.880 I think you know to to be to put 00:25:54.440 yourself in situations where you have to 00:25:58.240 work harder to do what you're trying to 00:26:01.039 do and yet accomplish goals I I mean 00:26:04.440 that that's the thing I think everybody 00:26:06.320 who's trying to you know help people 00:26:08.039 learn better said well what's a what 00:26:10.200 what's a way to make this 00:26:11.799 easier and and by definition making it 00:26:14.559 easier means you weren't learn it as 00:26:16.120 well there's a wonderful phrase uh 00:26:18.240 there's a there there's a psychologist 00:26:19.720 at UCLA named Robert Bork V VJ r k and 00:26:23.960 he and his wife Elizabeth have done just 00:26:26.120 a tremendous amount of research about 00:26:28.360 learning and he and he has this phrase 00:26:30.120 that he came up with there a lovely 00:26:31.360 phrase and he calls it desirable 00:26:33.679 difficulty right you want to create 00:26:35.919 situations that are desirably difficult 00:26:38.360 because surmounting that difficulty will 00:26:41.320 actually make what you do more memorable 00:26:43.039 in the future my music staff is the 00:26:45.279 easiest and most efficient way to run 00:26:47.279 your music teaching business this 00:26:49.279 complete

it's 00:28:04.799 the perfect tool to navigate your studio 00:28:06.559 through the busy back to school 00:28:09.039 season and I think uh when we was 00:28:11.720 talking about practice as well one thing 00:28:13.640 that I picked up from watching you in 00:28:14.840 action was the number of times you got 00:28:16.880 students to repeat things going over 00:28:19.159 things more doing more of the same and 00:28:21.760 even if it was right the first time well 00:28:23.559 let's do it again and at the end you 00:28:25.919 said let's do it again and let's do it 00:28:28.039 another time and it was almost I hadn't 00:28:30.720 quite seen that much repetition happen 00:28:33.039 particularly in a lesson perhaps in our 00:28:34.440 own practice but yeah I think that was 00:28:36.679 Again part of modeling what you want 00:28:38.480 them to do at home right yeah yeah I 00:28:40.960 mean I I I see lessons as an opportunity 00:28:44.320 to practice my 00:28:46.399 students so I it's as if they're the 00:28:49.799 instrument playing the instrument and 00:28:52.039 I'm practicing them so I asked myself 00:28:55.080 after I get work with a student to do 00:28:56.360 something and that student did it once 00:28:57.840 and I I often ask this of my students 00:29:00.039 you know we're watching a video 00:29:00.960 recording of their of a lesson they've 00:29:02.799 taught they get to a point plate and a 00:29:04.640 student does something and I stop the 00:29:06.640 video I say okay so how much you willing 00:29:08.559 to bet that that student's going to do 00:29:11.360 it again just like they did it this time 00:29:13.240 you know and often it's like nothing 00:29:15.720 okay so why are you moving on then why 00:29:18.399 you going on right I mean and so so I 00:29:21.000 always ask the question of myself this 00:29:23.519 gets back to the noticing thing when 00:29:24.960 somebody does something correctly are 00:29:26.320 they noticing 00:29:28.080 what's going on 00:29:30.240 sufficiently that they actually would 00:29:32.559 when I'm no longer in their presence and 00:29:34.279 they're practicing on their own that 00:29:35.880 they will continue to notice the things 00:29:37.600 that are the central features of 00:29:39.919 whatever it is they're trying to 00:29:40.919 accomplish you know and I will say one 00:29:44.679 thing excuse me for 00:29:45.880 interrupting you know often what what I 00:29:48.279 think gets annoying to people if they're 00:29:51.120 not used to repeating a lot is you know 00:29:54.159 when we say we'll do it one more time 00:29:55.360 and they do it one more time we say well 00:29:56.840 let's let's do it another time do I I I 00:29:59.799 I just replace one more time with some 00:30:01.799 number other than one you know let's do 00:30:04.640 that six six six six more times and you 00:30:07.279 know students were think wow six that's 00:30:08.919 a lot I mean it's gonna take 90 seconds 00:30:10.559 for God's sake you know I me but but I 00:30:13.440 think people are so unused to that my my 00:30:16.279 colleague here Lori Scott who's one of 00:30:18.000 the best Suzuki teachers I've ever seen 00:30:20.080 seen in my life we have this little kid 00:30:22.240 come us and say we're gonna do this a 00:30:23.559 hundred times today that kid gets really 00:30:25.000 big I wow 100 times it takes minutes you 00:30:27.919 know because it's some little thing that 00:30:29.399 you do 100 times and but and I I think 00:30:32.279 we you know we think we do something 00:30:34.600 twice and we think three times oh my God 00:30:36.919 that was a lot that's nothing and when 00:30:39.360 we look at people who are expert 00:30:41.279 practicers I mean people artist level 00:30:43.640 performers there's there's never one 00:30:46.080 more time I mean there are always mult 00:30:48.600 many more times 00:30:50.399 yeah you you also uh used a quote that I 00:30:53.840 wrote down that said don't accept 00:30:55.720 anything less than the kid is capable of 00:30:57.960 all the student is capable of and I 00:31:00.039 think many times I think it's very easy 00:31:02.080 as teachers you know we've got a very 00:31:03.760 short amount of time generally uh we've 00:31:05.880 got lots of repertoire to cover and we 00:31:07.240 still want to do some improvising and we 00:31:08.639 want to do the oral skills and all that 00:31:10.440 yeah and so we do accept less than we 00:31:13.760 know that student is capable of so how 00:31:15.880 do we how do we take that time or 00:31:18.320 convince ourselves of the importance of 00:31:19.840 taking the time to get them to repeat 00:31:21.639 things many times and and to have those 00:31:23.559 discussions with them when we have such 00:31:25.240 little time yeah well I mean I I WR I 00:31:28.639 wrote an article once I don't know where 00:31:29.960 this was I remember where it was it a 00:31:32.639 long time ago the article was called to 00:31:34.440 too little time too much stuff you know 00:31:36.960 and I it's it times a zero some game so 00:31:41.000 if you're gonna do more of something you 00:31:42.519 have to do less of something else and I 00:31:44.440 think 00:31:45.440 we not just in music but but in schools 00:31:48.159 in 00:31:48.840 general make the unfortunate decision to 00:31:51.840 think well I can't I have to do all of 00:31:53.679 this you know I and I have to do all 00:31:56.320 this all the time 00:31:58.200 and actually we we don't you know I I 00:32:00.559 give a talk for probably probably the 00:32:02.399 last 25 years here at Texas I've been 00:32:04.880 here a very long time I I give the I 00:32:07.720 give the opening talk on teaching to the 00:32:09.559 new faculty I mean not just the music 00:32:11.000 school the whole the new faculty on our 00:32:13.840 campus Teach as well yeah oh yeah yeah 00:32:17.039 yeah so these are all faculty who are 00:32:18.840 you know I me I mean probably we hire I 00:32:21.200 don't know 120 150 faculty every every 00:32:25.440 year and so you know the president comes 00:32:27.279 and welcomes them to the university and 00:32:28.480 then I give a talk about teaching and 00:32:30.399 and and one of the things that uh that I 00:32:33.000 say during that talk because some of 00:32:34.880 these people are they just came out of a 00:32:36.760 post this is their first faculty 00:32:38.279 position and other people have been on a 00:32:39.679 faculty before and they're moving to UT 00:32:41.320 and that kind of thing but all the 00:32:43.120 younger faculty you know I say look 00:32:44.880 here's the thing you probably started 00:32:46.799 working on your syllabus and everything 00:32:48.039 put the content it look at the content 00:32:50.440 in your 00:32:51.320 syllabus take two-thirds of it and toss 00:32:54.600 it out you know like what do you you 00:32:58.080 crazy yeah I mean I mean I'm I'm 00:33:00.480 teaching first semester chemistry and my 00:33:02.639 department chair is teaching second 00:33:04.039 semester chemistry so if my student gets 00:33:06.559 a second semester and she doesn't know 00:33:08.639 something and the and my department 00:33:10.440 chair says who you take first semester 00:33:12.039 with and it's me you know then what and 00:33:14.200 what I assure them all is you know no 00:33:15.799 matter what you teaching first semester 00:33:17.279 that's gonna happen anyway so free 00:33:19.279 yourself from that burden of thinking 00:33:21.679 that if you cover all this stuff it's 00:33:23.000 going to be all in your students heads 00:33:24.559 because it's not and so well and what 00:33:27.480 you can do instead is think about how 00:33:30.480 can I focus on what are the essential 00:33:34.720 features of artistry or chemistry or 00:33:39.200 whatever it is and do those things so 00:33:42.600 often and in so many different contexts 00:33:45.080 that becomes what people think this 00:33:47.760 whole deal is about right so I mean if 00:33:50.399 you think about any kind of pianistic 00:33:52.399 skills I mean you certainly want to have 00:33:54.039 facility but what are you really 00:33:55.399 thinking about you're talking about 00:33:56.320 evenness of timing evenness of tone 00:33:59.559 connectedness of pitches whether you're 00:34:01.159 playing Legato or staccato there's a 00:34:03.399 sense of connectivity to what you're 00:34:04.720 doing you know okay you you can do that 00:34:08.399 all the time on on a lot of different 00:34:10.918 pieces right but if you're spending the 00:34:12.918 majority of your time just getting 00:34:15.239 through the notes just getting to where 00:34:17.159 you can you know get to from the 00:34:19.119 beginning to the end without stopping 00:34:20.520 you know and the metronomes on eight you 00:34:22.879 know because you can't play anywhere 00:34:24.800 close to 00:34:25.879 Tempo never going to get that sense of 00:34:28.119 that you know the student isn't going to 00:34:29.560 think the most important thing is this 00:34:31.679 little connection between those two 00:34:33.000 pitches right there to go from the G to 00:34:34.560 the a does that really sound like this 00:34:36.639 thing that happens I tell when you know 00:34:38.719 both both of my grandchildren when they 00:34:40.000 start playing 00:34:41.359 piano I I I would never teach anybody 00:34:44.280 piano because I'm I'm a I'm a I'll put 00:34:46.440 it this way I'm an enthusiastic pianist 00:34:48.639 so uh but but but what I would do when 00:34:51.719 it was time when they were old enough to 00:34:53.520 put their hand on a keyboard and strong 00:34:55.040 enough to push down a key I would just 00:34:57.520 put my right hand on on the piano and 00:34:59.880 put their hand an octave higher than 00:35:01.400 mine and I would do something with like 00:35:04.599 two or three pitches and ask them to 00:35:06.440 imitate it but notice we're only playing 00:35:09.280 two or three pitches so what I'm asking 00:35:11.480 to imitate is the 00:35:13.720 inflection I I I'm asking them to 00:35:18.960 go and then my little grandchild will go 00:35:21.040 you know be I said does that sound like 00:35:22.880 mine listen to mine 00:35:24.280 again you know and after and we're doing 00:35:26.680 this little tiny thing and when she got 00:35:29.200 to where she could actually go beat up 00:35:31.200 it's just like me that was like wow look 00:35:33.720 at that you know spectacular you know 00:35:36.960 and the thing is when that becomes the 00:35:38.640 goal right when you're really trying to 00:35:41.079 make something that's truly artistic and 00:35:44.200 expressive and beautiful then you can do 00:35:46.320 little things like that and take joy in 00:35:48.800 those little accomplishments you know 00:35:50.560 but if you're blowing through repertoire 00:35:53.240 because somebody told you you have to 00:35:54.800 you know and you never really Master 00:35:58.800 anything I'm not surprised that students 00:36:01.240 eventually say look I'm I'm done with 00:36:02.880 piano you know I I want to go play 00:36:04.760 soccer or what you know whatever they 00:36:06.040 want to do because it's not this isn't 00:36:07.920 gratifying to me you know I mean we we 00:36:10.640 like to do things that we find rewarding 00:36:13.920 and rewarding has to include a sense of 00:36:17.800 personal accomplishment you 00:36:20.000 know I was thinking too you we were 00:36:22.359 talking earlier on about comparison 00:36:23.839 getting a student to play something a 00:36:25.119 few times and compare them but as you've 00:36:27.359 mentioned too another great opportunity 00:36:29.200 is for us to play something and for them 00:36:31.680 to play something and ask them to 00:36:33.040 compare what was 00:36:34.560 different yeah I know I know you know I 00:36:38.000 I talked to a number of teachers who say 00:36:39.280 well I don't want to you know model too 00:36:40.640 much for my student because I want them 00:36:41.880 to have their own you 00:36:43.640 know play for your students I mean you 00:36:46.640 think about how often does a kid get to 00:36:49.599 sit next to a highly skilled pianist and 00:36:52.359 hear a piano played beautifully while 00:36:55.160 they're sitting right there I mean it's 00:36:57.720 spectacular you know and I I you know my 00:37:01.119 my thought is always I I want to play 00:37:03.200 for my students enough that they think 00:37:06.040 about boy I want to sound like that and 00:37:08.920 and because I'm right here and they're 00:37:10.240 right there you know I can convincingly 00:37:12.160 say I I can teach you to sound like that 00:37:14.319 you know you have to do some things to 00:37:16.119 get there but I can teach you to sound 00:37:17.800 just like that but rather than just sort 00:37:20.079 of saying that I can actually 00:37:21.800 demonstrate that by modeling myself 00:37:25.079 things that they're fully capable of 00:37:26.680 doing in a relatively short period of 00:37:28.160 time you know I remember having that 00:37:29.880 experience when I was studying for my 00:37:31.160 own performance diploma and watching 00:37:33.599 just watching sitting next to my teacher 00:37:35.160 performed these Works without just sight 00:37:37.319 reading the things I'm struggling at and 00:37:39.800 they were just beautiful and it did it 00:37:42.400 uh it really has such meaning to see 00:37:44.720 that and experience that yeah yeah it's 00:37:47.359 just I I mean it's a it's a it's a 00:37:49.440 lovely thing but you know I find the 00:37:50.760 same thing my undergraduate students 00:37:53.200 here are undergraduate students who are 00:37:54.800 going to teach in public schools and 00:37:56.000 teach Orchestra band and those kind 00:37:57.920 things I mean we we have to push them 00:38:01.000 because it's not common practice in the 00:38:03.680 US when you're a band director and 00:38:05.640 Orchestra director you don't play your 00:38:07.359 instrument you know you stand up there 00:38:08.640 with a baton and you talk and wave your 00:38:10.800 arms and stuff and I kind of spent all 00:38:12.760 these years learning to play the damn 00:38:13.960 trumpet play the trumpet you know I I 00:38:16.440 mean don't don't sit there talking to 00:38:18.319 people about what a phrase should sound 00:38:19.599 like just play it y I think we can we 00:38:22.640 can all shut our mouths more and play 00:38:25.440 more can't exactly sure we're all 00:38:28.240 Shockers for that as am I 00:38:30.760 yeah inevitable part of being a human 00:38:33.280 being that's true I remember doing uh 00:38:35.599 trying a silent lesson once that was an 00:38:37.520 incredibly challenging experience I 00:38:39.160 don't know if you've ever tried it or 00:38:40.280 with your oh yeah yeah sure just just to 00:38:43.040 actually not say a word unbelievably 00:38:45.240 difficult but but a really great 00:38:47.440 experience to look back 00:38:49.400 on um just a couple more questions Bob 00:38:53.440 um I I wrote down a quote when you were 00:38:55.880 speaking uh that has always resonated 00:38:58.920 and stuck with me and you said something 00:39:00.599 like kids who always look at their 00:39:03.240 teacher when they finish playing are 00:39:05.040 more likely to quit yeah and that that 00:39:08.079 just hit me in the face and I thought 00:39:10.079 wow okay this this is something that I 00:39:11.520 need to work on with my students can you 00:39:12.800 tell us a bit more about where this has 00:39:14.040 come from and and what suggestions you'd 00:39:15.520 have sure you know I I have to say you 00:39:18.920 know that's that's one experiment that 00:39:21.319 that looked at this so I you know I 00:39:23.160 wouldn't say I am absolutely certain at 00:39:25.880 this yep but the the the reason I sort 00:39:29.720 of you know latched on to that finding 00:39:32.040 and that study what was was this I you 00:39:37.040 know we all often have to ask ourselves 00:39:38.720 why why is anybody why are any of us 00:39:40.720 doing anything you know and I think you 00:39:44.280 know teaching music and learning music 00:39:46.359 is such there's such a mentorship 00:39:48.160 relationship you know it's like a master 00:39:50.119 Apprentice kind of thing and and I think 00:39:53.400 you know all of us who have had the 00:39:55.880 benefit of having wonderful teachers we 00:39:58.359 we do admire them and we do look up to 00:40:00.319 them and want to please them you know 00:40:02.440 and that kind of thing but I but I think 00:40:05.560 it's it's it's often the case that that 00:40:09.280 becomes the primary motivator for 00:40:12.040 students is making sure that their the 00:40:15.359 adults around them are happy with them 00:40:18.200 and I you know I I I get that I know how 00:40:21.040 that happens but I think that what it 00:40:24.640 what's required to be good at anything I 00:40:27.000 mean really good at it being good at 00:40:28.760 writing being good at you know painting 00:40:31.520 or playing the piano whereever it is and 00:40:34.240 individual has to be able to to to to 00:40:37.040 reinforce themselves and not just look 00:40:40.280 to other places to tell people how good 00:40:42.720 they are because you know you know you 00:40:44.560 think about how long you've been playing 00:40:45.640 playing the piano I think about how long 00:40:47.480 I've been playing music the reason I 00:40:49.800 love what I do is not because other 00:40:51.880 people tell me I'm good or because I win 00:40:54.480 something I mean people do tell me that 00:40:57.040 and I do win stuff but that's not why 00:40:58.400 I'm doing it that's just stuff that 00:40:59.760 happens because I'm good you know but 00:41:02.839 that would never be enough to motivate 00:41:05.400 me to do what I need to do to be really 00:41:08.040 good you know what I mean yes and I and 00:41:10.720 I think you know it's hard to get some 00:41:13.400 kids motivated to practice and and it's 00:41:15.319 easy to say well you know I I'll give 00:41:17.280 you this or I'll put a star on your 00:41:18.760 music and that kind of stuff that okay 00:41:20.680 fine I mean that stuff will get some 00:41:22.800 kids to do things but unless the kids 00:41:25.359 starts to take some personal pleasure in 00:41:28.280 their own accomplishment and they think 00:41:30.560 listen to what I just did that that was 00:41:32.280 spectacular you know I mean to 00:41:34.640 themselves then then then there's never 00:41:37.839 going to be enough of an impetus for 00:41:40.200 them to continue putting forth effort to 00:41:42.440 do what they need to do to be really 00:41:43.800 good right so yeah so there'll never be 00:41:46.319 enough stars or chocolates or whatever 00:41:47.839 it is or praise to keep them motivated 00:41:50.880 themselves and so this we're talking 00:41:52.319 motivation strategies here ar oh yeah 00:41:55.319 and and think you know I I mean when you 00:41:57.520 think about somebody I mean kids who are 00:42:01.359 you know almost literally addicted to a 00:42:04.480 video game and and you think you know 00:42:07.680 what no one's giving them anything for 00:42:10.240 that you know the there aren't you know 00:42:13.880 they may have some gold stars in the 00:42:15.319 game or something you know but I mean 00:42:17.000 there's no other person involved in this 00:42:19.520 they're just engaged in the game and and 00:42:22.680 and when they when they reach a new 00:42:24.800 level or they do whatever the game you 00:42:27.839 know whatever the game's goals are you 00:42:29.440 reach one of those goals it's like a big 00:42:31.000 deal because you reach a goal right but 00:42:33.559 but the there's there's a sense because 00:42:35.480 there's not an obvious you know human 00:42:37.440 involved controlling all all of this do 00:42:39.720 you think I did that you know I did that 00:42:42.800 and I'm I'm happy because I did that I'm 00:42:44.839 not happy because Mom likes it or be I 00:42:47.520 mean that's nice that Mom likes it you 00:42:49.200 know or that my teacher likes it but but 00:42:51.160 but I did that and and I like it enough 00:42:54.599 to make me want to do it some more 00:42:57.200 but if if if I never like it enough that 00:43:00.040 makes me want to do it some more and I 00:43:01.760 only like it enough that I have to get 00:43:03.520 some more stuff from somebody else 00:43:05.079 before I'm gonna do it some more I'm 00:43:06.520 never gonna persist at this so the 00:43:09.200 million-dollar question then how do we 00:43:12.319 convert the piano experience or any 00:43:14.520 instrument into the video game 00:43:16.200 experience are there are there any 00:43:18.000 tricks that you've learned about goal 00:43:19.760 setting or anything like that sure and 00:43:22.200 and it's and it's it's very much 00:43:24.280 connected to what we were just talking 00:43:25.920 about right uh earlier on in the podcast 00:43:28.760 and and that is setting goals that are 00:43:31.520 small 00:43:33.200 enough and and challenging 00:43:36.160 enough and doable enough that people 00:43:40.400 will work to accomplish you know I I've 00:43:42.599 started doing a thing when I did give 00:43:44.160 talks now I I I don't think I did this 00:43:45.680 when I was in Adela a couple couple 00:43:47.119 years ago but I I was just in uh I was 00:43:50.880 just giving the keynote at the Florida 00:43:53.000 mus music educators conference uh in 00:43:55.559 Tampa last month I don't know they 00:43:57.760 probably I don't know 2,000 people in 00:44:00.119 this big old crazy Hall you know and I 00:44:02.359 said here's what I want you to do we're 00:44:04.720 we're all gonna clap together once we're 00:44:08.040 just gonna clap once no you you did do 00:44:11.200 this that go go and explain it though 00:44:13.880 it's great yeah and you know and I got 00:44:15.839 all this room full of people and and and 00:44:18.640 I stopped them and said why are you 00:44:20.160 working so hard this this is this is a 00:44:22.440 stupid thing why why are you and and and 00:44:25.040 the features of it were 00:44:26.599 the goal was very clear each person in 00:44:29.640 that room was convinced that they could 00:44:31.000 do the goal and they were making 00:44:33.119 discriminations about when they got it 00:44:34.520 and when they did every learning 00:44:36.319 experience has to do that and every 00:44:38.599 every great video game does that you're 00:44:41.480 really clear about what the goal is 00:44:43.480 you're really clear about when you make 00:44:45.040 it and when you don't but you're 00:44:47.200 convinced that you're going to be able 00:44:48.160 to do it right so if you say you know 00:44:51.520 here's this sonata movement good luck 00:44:54.520 well I I don't know you know I don't 00:44:56.839 have a lot of confidence that I'm going 00:44:58.280 to be able to do that right but if if if 00:45:01.119 if you as a Pianist you know you're 00:45:03.720 you're teaching a jazz lesson and you 00:45:06.359 have this little cool turnaround in a 00:45:08.319 251 progression and I'm gonna teach you 00:45:10.119 to do this and we're just gonna do that 00:45:12.400 we're just gonna do this turnaround here 00:45:15.040 and and the and the kid actually learns 00:45:16.359 to do that around think that's really 00:45:18.559 cool you know I I got that and and you 00:45:21.680 don't you don't have to give me a pat on 00:45:23.319 the head or tell me you know I get a 00:45:25.079 gold start thing I'm just glad that I 00:45:26.559 can do that thing and I think that's 00:45:29.119 where the power of root teaching which 00:45:31.119 has become more and more popular 00:45:32.280 particularly with piano I don't know 00:45:33.400 about other instruments particularly in 00:45:35.359 those beginner first few months has 00:45:37.160 become uh a really important part of a 00:45:39.920 lot of teachers experience with their 00:45:41.440 students because bang you can just have 00:45:43.520 success they can sound cool and they're 00:45:45.680 winning very early on yeah and and and I 00:45:49.520 think you know I mean if you think about 00:45:52.079 the way we learn most of the things that 00:45:55.160 we learn 00:45:56.960 uh to do outside of school you know to 00:45:59.280 to ambulate to talk uh to manipulate 00:46:03.200 objects all that kind of stuff none of 00:46:06.680 that is done with explanations and 00:46:09.680 instructions it's all done by imitation 00:46:13.839 observation and you try to make you try 00:46:16.599 to do what this other person is doing 00:46:18.440 and and as you get better at noticing 00:46:20.920 and your teacher or parent or caregiver 00:46:23.640 helps you become better at noticing how 00:46:25.520 what I'm doing isn't quite like what 00:46:26.920 you're doing yet and maybe if you did 00:46:28.720 this it would look more like what I'm 00:46:29.880 doing that's how people learn to do 00:46:31.760 stuff you know and to say let's learn to 00:46:34.319 play the piano now look at this code up 00:46:36.920 here on the stand and we're gonna figure 00:46:39.240 out what all those dots mean I mean why 00:46:43.160 the argument that people make about why 00:46:44.680 you've got to do it that way damn it is 00:46:47.119 false you know I mean that if if you 00:46:49.040 don't start kids reading right away 00:46:51.559 they're they're never going to want to 00:46:52.599 learn to read that that is just nonsense 00:46:54.720 there is no evidence that that's the 00:46:56.319 case whatsoever now I'm not saying it's 00:46:58.599 not the case that some teacher who tried 00:47:00.760 to keep teach a kid by a road and now 00:47:03.200 the kid didn't want to to play music but 00:47:04.800 that's the teacher's fault it's not the 00:47:06.400 process's fault 00:47:08.520 right say that with love love no no it's 00:47:12.160 good it's no it's really good to hear 00:47:13.359 because uh I I've had a few people on 00:47:15.720 the podcast before when we've talked 00:47:17.079 about Road teaching my own uh beginner 00:47:19.359 teaching framework is very creative and 00:47:21.359 there's no reading for for months uh 00:47:23.839 it's all about just getting involved in 00:47:25.839 music copy play Sing improvise create 00:47:29.680 yeah that's the important stuff to me 00:47:31.319 and it sounds like you would tend to 00:47:32.680 agree oh yeah yeah well I 00:47:35.079 mean I heartily agree I I I I mean you 00:47:38.319 know if you think about what most people 00:47:41.280 imagine when you tell a kid you're GNA 00:47:44.119 learn to play the piano or you're gonna 00:47:46.319 learn to play a trumpet or the drums or 00:47:49.680 whatever what what they're imagining is 00:47:52.319 is actually playing the thing you know 00:47:55.079 and actually doing things that sound to 00:47:57.119 them like the music they already know 00:48:00.640 I'm not talking about popular music 00:48:01.880 versus I'm not talking about that at all 00:48:03.880 but sound like music there are phrases 00:48:05.920 there are gestures there are expressive 00:48:08.480 intentions that come across because of 00:48:10.119 what you do and and when you start with 00:48:12.440 that right when you start with what 00:48:14.720 music is for which is to convey things 00:48:17.800 to other human 00:48:18.960 beings well now You' now you've got them 00:48:21.960 right I I mean I I mean I and listen I I 00:48:25.400 give lot of talks for teachers in The 00:48:27.280 Sciences as well as in the Arts and you 00:48:30.160 know I walk into a lot of science 00:48:31.800 classrooms I see a lot of kids are busy 00:48:34.480 you they're active because somebody said 00:48:36.200 Active Learning is good okay fine but I 00:48:39.000 don't see anything in the room that 00:48:40.000 looks like science you know even though 00:48:42.079 it's a science classroom they're not 00:48:44.040 doing the things that scientists do that 00:48:46.319 make them love the fact that they're 00:48:47.559 scientists right they're doing stuff 00:48:49.880 they're following these procedures that 00:48:51.400 somebody else gave them to get to this 00:48:52.920 answer and somehow that's supposed to 00:48:54.839 teach them something that maybe it does 00:48:57.079 and maybe it doesn't but if if you start 00:49:00.440 to think about why why do I do this you 00:49:02.559 know why do I play the piano think well 00:49:05.400 this is why I play the piano so why 00:49:06.839 shouldn't I create as many experiences I 00:49:08.559 can so my students get to do that and 00:49:11.200 not assuming they have to suffer for 00:49:13.599 many 00:49:15.079 years to get there yeah and if they can 00:49:17.960 stick it out baby then they'll get to do 00:49:20.280 something you know beautiful in the end 00:49:22.720 yeah uh Bob it's a a great great note to 00:49:26.160 finish up on I did want to mention uh 00:49:28.040 you've got a fantastic book out there 00:49:29.760 it's called intelligent music teaching 00:49:32.000 uh in that book do you cover similar 00:49:33.839 things to what we've been talking about 00:49:34.960 today I do yeah I I I mean I you know 00:49:38.440 that I I wrote that as a collection of 00:49:40.480 essays uh for a class that I was 00:49:43.799 teaching and I I I I sort of thought 00:49:46.520 about well what what would I like my 00:49:49.319 students to think about when they're 00:49:51.119 organizing their own teaching and what 00:49:52.799 they're what they're doing when they're 00:49:54.400 planning in uh in in instruction for 00:49:56.920 their own students and uh intelligent 00:49:59.000 music teaching it's been out it's hard 00:50:00.400 for me to believe it's it's about 18 00:50:02.599 years old now it's gone through I don't 00:50:04.280 know this his 20th printing or something 00:50:06.559 that's just crazy I never imagin you 00:50:08.240 know it's still a very popular book 00:50:09.839 which makes me happy uh and and I and I 00:50:12.880 think you know many 00:50:14.480 teachers who have gone through pedagogy 00:50:17.480 instruction you know if you look about 00:50:19.400 what what most pedagogy is about it's 00:50:22.559 really about they talk about repertoire 00:50:24.480 and sequencing of repertoire you know 00:50:26.119 you do these pieces first and then this 00:50:27.920 is this is going to prepare you for this 00:50:29.200 set and that's kind of the way it goes 00:50:31.400 and this book isn't about any of that 00:50:33.400 it's really about how human beings 00:50:35.559 interact with one another with the goal 00:50:37.920 of helping one of those human beings to 00:50:39.440 learn to do something new that's great 00:50:43.200 uh and I think that's available on 00:50:44.280 Amazon if people are interested it is 00:50:46.240 yeah yeah fantastic and where can people 00:50:48.000 find out more about you and uh the 00:50:49.760 lectures and workshops and things that 00:50:51.559 you're involved in great well I I I have 00:50:53.880 a a a center for Music Learning here at 00:50:56.480 the University of Texas at Austin and uh 00:50:58.480 if you just Google Center for Music 00:50:59.799 Learning you'll you'll find that there 00:51:01.440 are a lot of materials there a lot of it 00:51:03.559 just free things to look at there's a 00:51:05.960 wonderful uh section of the site called 00:51:08.079 the nature of expertise where there are 00:51:09.760 videos of really superb uh artist level 00:51:13.960 teachers teaching students uh and one of 00:51:16.559 those artists is uh Nita true so all the 00:51:19.400 N true fans out there can watch Nita 00:51:21.319 teaching her own students and it's a 00:51:22.880 different thing right because when you 00:51:23.960 watch a Master Class you know the 00:51:25.960 relationship's a little bit odd because 00:51:27.520 teachers know the stent and vice versa 00:51:29.079 but this is like these people working 00:51:30.440 with their own students and you kind of 00:51:31.760 see that uh they they let me invade 00:51:34.319 their privacy for a couple of weeks 00:51:36.760 so Cent mus learning yeah it's I mean 00:51:40.720 watching other teachers teach I think is 00:51:42.119 one of the best things to do which is 00:51:43.520 why I enjoyed watching you on stage and 00:51:45.920 uh why we've got lots of videos in in 00:51:47.799 our membership as well about with other 00:51:49.559 teachers teaching I think it's a great 00:51:50.960 way to learn so Bob thank you so much 00:51:52.880 for your time I know to Sunday afternoon 00:51:54.200 and you've very kindly given it to to us 00:51:55.880 uh it's been fantastic to connect with 00:51:57.280 you thanks you bet it's been a real 00:51:58.640

great little 00:52:24.280 ideas that you can take away and try out 00:52:27.160 and as you heard I've tried a number of 00:52:29.079 his ideas that I've got at previous 00:52:30.559 conferences where

00:02:22.480 told him i try not to blow it uh uh this 00:02:24.720 is a wonderful series and i i want to 00:02:26.239 commend uh mcmaster for initiating 00:02:28.560 something like this to sort of provoke 00:02:30.000 thought which i hope i will do with all 00:02:31.760 of you today i want to ask before i 00:02:32.800 start there are many cables that i could 00:02:34.239 be wearing but i want to make sure that 00:02:35.040 everyone back and hear me without a 00:02:36.000 microphone is that okay good great um 00:02:38.560 this instruction is meant for you uh so 00:02:40.959 i know this may be a little chaotic and 00:02:42.400 i'm going to take the risk anyway if 00:02:44.160 you're sitting next to only people you 00:02:45.440 know i'd like you to stand up and shift 00:02:47.200 in your row so you're next to someone 00:02:48.560 that you've not yet met so all you while 00:02:50.400 you stand up and do that right now 00:02:52.800 okay thank you um 00:02:54.959 that didn't take as long as i thought um 00:02:58.000 now i'm going to give you an assignment 00:02:58.879 to do for just a minute but before i do 00:03:00.480 that i'd like to play a short video 00:03:03.200 with some music on it because i'm a 00:03:04.239 music guy and i have to acknowledge all 00:03:05.680 my colleagues in the faculty arts and 00:03:06.879 thank you for initiating all this have 00:03:08.319 everybody coming up here uh for those of 00:03:10.000 you who are interested in the music that 00:03:10.879 i was playing uh while you were coming 00:03:12.319 into the room today uh that was a 00:03:13.519 wonderful composer singer bass player 00:03:15.440 named esperanza spalding i often 00:03:17.519 introduce her to crowds who don't know 00:03:18.480 her because one of her great 00:03:19.440 contributions to music is several years 00:03:21.200 ago she beat out justin bieber for best 00:03:23.120 new artist at the grammys so i thought 00:03:24.480 she deserves a shout out 00:03:28.959 i walk into many classrooms or watch 00:03:30.480 video recordings of many classrooms not 00:03:32.080 just in music in the sciences in the 00:03:33.840 humanities and i see students doing 00:03:35.920 things that bear only a faint 00:03:37.760 resemblance to what the discipline is 00:03:40.159 actually for 00:03:41.440 there's really not a focus on what the 00:03:42.959 thing that we're studying is really 00:03:44.560 about and i'll talk more about that as 00:03:46.239 we go along today but i just want to say 00:03:48.000 that these kinds of experiences the 00:03:49.680 experiences that start with a clear 00:03:51.680 focus about what is this for now when i 00:03:54.159 say what is this for i don't mean how do 00:03:55.599 you make money with it because i often 00:03:57.040 have students ask me or have my 00:03:58.480 colleagues tell me the student asked 00:03:59.519 them you know what am i ever going to 00:04:00.480 use this well 00:04:02.000 that's a that's a terrible rationale for 00:04:03.439 studying anything in college and often 00:04:04.720 when i have a student tell me i'm 00:04:05.599 wearing this thing when am i ever going 00:04:06.400 to use that i often have students did 00:04:07.519 you go to did you go to a movie last 00:04:08.879 week and often they say well yeah i did 00:04:10.000 i thought are you ever going to use that 00:04:11.439 right i mean you go to a movie because 00:04:12.799 there's something interesting about it 00:04:13.760 or or enlightening about it or at least 00:04:15.599 entertaining about it right 00:04:17.358 but when we think about how we plan 00:04:18.880 things in higher education and in 00:04:20.160 primary secondary education as well i 00:04:22.000 think a question that isn't asked often 00:04:23.520 enough or thought about clearly and 00:04:24.800 deeply enough is what is the thing that 00:04:26.880 we're trying to accomplish with the 00:04:28.400 people with whom we work whether they're 00:04:29.840 young children adults people in business 00:04:32.160 who are training employees whatever it 00:04:33.440 happens to be what is the thing that 00:04:34.800 we're actually trying to bring about in 00:04:35.919 the way that people think i mean 00:04:38.000 everyone knows if you look at curricula 00:04:39.840 in higher education or even in high 00:04:41.600 school secondary school primary primary 00:04:43.199 school almost all the courses are named 00:04:45.520 by the content of the course so this 00:04:47.680 course is about genetics this course is 00:04:50.000 about biological sciences this course is 00:04:51.680 about the history of music from 1750 to 00:04:53.440 the present day whatever the thing 00:04:54.400 happens to be but of course the goal 00:04:56.400 is much more than just conveying the 00:04:58.720 learners information about the content 00:05:01.120 that the course title describes i mean 00:05:03.520 what we're trying to do at texas now and 00:05:04.639 what i'm also trying to do at coburn is 00:05:06.080 acknowledge the fact that what education 00:05:08.160 is for is shaping thinking is teaching 00:05:10.720 people to think effectively and reason 00:05:12.400 effectively and communicate effectively 00:05:13.919 with other human beings right it's not 00:05:15.520 about the content and everyone in this 00:05:17.360 room who is an expert at anything knows 00:05:19.199 that your expertise is not the fact that 00:05:21.039 you know a lot of stuff now you do know 00:05:22.400 a lot of stuff 00:05:23.440 but the expertise comes from what you do 00:05:24.880 with the stuff you know right it's how 00:05:26.400 you use what you know to accomplish 00:05:28.000 things to solve problems to create new 00:05:29.600 things and that's the real purpose of 00:05:32.160 studying anything whatever it happens to 00:05:33.600 be it's not about the content again i'll 00:05:34.960 come to that again in just a few minutes 00:05:36.560 um we're all very fortunate to have this 00:05:38.400 three pounds of goo in our heads i don't 00:05:39.840 know if anybody can control the lights 00:05:40.960 in this room but if these front lights 00:05:42.080 could be a little dimmer i think people 00:05:43.120 are probably these slides a little 00:05:43.919 better um 00:05:45.520 this is uh 00:05:46.560 a typical human brain this is this is 00:05:47.840 not life-size by the way this is bigger 00:05:49.039 than uh 00:05:50.000 um but what's remarkable about this 00:05:51.919 thing most complicated machine in the 00:05:54.080 known universe upwards of a hundred 00:05:56.000 billion neurons in a typical human brain 00:05:57.600 and that doesn't count all the 00:05:58.800 astrocytes estrogen all the other 00:06:00.080 support cells that are in a typical 100 00:06:01.919 billion neurons that make upwards of 100 00:06:04.160 trillion connections with each other now 00:06:05.360 those are unimaginably large numbers as 00:06:07.120 our brains evolved we did not evolve to 00:06:08.800 deal with numbers that large i mean we 00:06:10.080 evolved to think that there's nothing 00:06:11.120 there there's something there there are 00:06:12.319 a couple things there there's a lot of 00:06:13.360 stuff there that's as sophisticated as 00:06:14.560 our intuitive number sense gets so the 00:06:16.160 idea of 100 billion neurons make 100 00:06:17.919 trillion connections not within our 00:06:19.520 scope of being able to think about in an 00:06:21.199 intuitive way but one thing's remarkable 00:06:22.960 about what brains do is they do two 00:06:24.240 things really well and one is they 00:06:25.919 recognize patterns in environmental 00:06:27.520 stimuli so as we kind of look around the 00:06:29.199 world right now we look around the room 00:06:30.800 we see patterns right our brains are 00:06:32.639 looking for patterns in fact our brains 00:06:33.919 are so good at finding patterns we find 00:06:35.360 patterns even when there are no patterns 00:06:36.880 right we can look at a cloud and say 00:06:38.160 look at that look at that antelope well 00:06:39.520 it's not an antelope it's a cloud so why 00:06:40.880 do we see an antelope there because our 00:06:41.919 brains are looking for ways to connect 00:06:43.199 that shape into something that we 00:06:44.560 already recognize and that brings up the 00:06:46.000 second thing that brains do really well 00:06:47.199 right is they form associations between 00:06:49.919 various stimuli and ideas that are 00:06:51.840 already in our head and those 00:06:53.199 associations we'd like to think are 00:06:54.800 always based on logical reasoning but 00:06:56.160 actually most of the associations are 00:06:57.120 based primarily on temporal proximity 00:06:59.840 that is things that happen near to each 00:07:01.199 other tend to become associated over 00:07:02.560 time and one of the important things to 00:07:03.919 think about for all of us who are 00:07:04.880 teachers and all of us who are learners 00:07:06.000 got other law students in here too is 00:07:07.680 how do we optimize the extent to which 00:07:09.840 we connect different ideas that we have 00:07:11.759 in our heads for a long time up the 00:07:13.440 middle of the last century actually the 00:07:14.800 prevailing wisdom in psychology the 00:07:16.240 brain sort of worked like recorders you 00:07:17.360 woke up the morning report the record 00:07:18.639 button goes on you experience things 00:07:20.160 gets written on the tape right you go to 00:07:21.520 sleep pause button goes on you want to 00:07:23.280 wake up the next day you want to 00:07:24.080 remember what happened two o'clock the 00:07:24.880 day before you rewind to take the two 00:07:25.919 o'clock play two o'clock there's two 00:07:26.880 o'clock today before that's a terrible 00:07:28.080 metaphor for organic brains for a lot of 00:07:30.240 reasons not the least of which is the 00:07:31.759 tape in your head isn't blank 00:07:33.520 there's stuff already in there and what 00:07:35.360 your brains are trying to do when you 00:07:36.240 experience something new is figure out 00:07:37.840 how does what's happening right now 00:07:39.440 relate to the stuff that's already in my 00:07:40.880 mind whether you're doing that 00:07:42.319 volitionally or just non-consciously 00:07:44.000 that's happening all the time so 00:07:45.440 everyone who's in this room right now is 00:07:47.039 experiencing this moment differently 00:07:49.120 from the person sitting next to you not 00:07:50.720 just because you're in a different place 00:07:52.160 and so you have a different visual 00:07:53.039 perspective and a different auditory 00:07:54.000 perspective but because you have 00:07:55.199 different experiences that you bring to 00:07:56.479 this moment and those experiences color 00:07:58.400 what's happening right now not only that 00:08:00.240 when all of you leave this room today 00:08:01.680 what happens to you after this 90 00:08:03.280 minutes is going to also affect what you 00:08:04.800 remember of right now so memory is not a 00:08:07.120 static thing when you're working on your 00:08:08.400 computer another metaphor that we often 00:08:09.759 use to think about organic memories and 00:08:11.680 you press the save command what your 00:08:13.120 computer does looks for a blank space on 00:08:14.240 the drive there with blank spaces again 00:08:16.000 writes what you just saved which means 00:08:17.520 binary switches flip from one to zero 00:08:18.960 zero to one in some configuration that 00:08:20.240 represents what you just intended to 00:08:21.360 save puts an address on it so the next 00:08:22.720 time you go to your computer and you 00:08:23.680 click on that address it'll go look for 00:08:25.199 that information it'll read off what you 00:08:26.960 saved the day before the week before the 00:08:28.160 month before and barring some 00:08:29.120 malfunction or disaster to your computer 00:08:31.440 what you wrote yesterday will be 00:08:32.719 precisely what you wrote before right if 00:08:35.360 you click on the icon today it'll be 00:08:36.399 just what you wrote yesterday or last 00:08:37.599 week or last month and what's on the 00:08:39.919 drive already when you save the new 00:08:41.519 thing has no effect on the new stuff 00:08:43.440 that you save and anything you save 00:08:45.200 subsequent to that thing that you saved 00:08:46.640 will have no effect on what you just 00:08:47.680 saved again borrowing some malfunction 00:08:49.200 now again organic frames don't work 00:08:50.560 anything like that memory is a 00:08:52.000 tremendously dynamic thing and we ignore 00:08:54.959 that at our apparel yet when you look at 00:08:56.800 most educational experiences that we 00:08:58.000 plan for learners again at every level 00:08:59.360 of expertise we tend to ignore the idea 00:09:01.600 that everyone is walking into the room 00:09:03.040 with a different set of experiences and 00:09:05.200 because of that we'll experience what 00:09:06.640 they're experiencing differently from 00:09:07.920 other people in the room and all of you 00:09:09.839 who have sat in a class which some of 00:09:11.120 you probably did today right know that 00:09:12.640 the experiences you're having are 00:09:13.600 different from your classmates those of 00:09:14.720 you who have taught a class wonder with 00:09:16.320 some mystery why that one student seems 00:09:18.080 so fascinated by what you're doing and 00:09:19.360 another student seems to be such a 00:09:20.480 miscreant we can't get him to put this 00:09:22.000 newspaper down now that may be based on 00:09:24.320 some you know inherent flaws or 00:09:25.920 advantages that some people have but i 00:09:27.440 would argue that much of it has to do 00:09:28.399 with the fact that we teach in a way 00:09:30.399 that presumes that all learners come 00:09:32.399 into the room relatively similarly 00:09:34.480 and then all of them learn in similar 00:09:36.240 ways and at similar rates and that we 00:09:38.560 when we evaluate them they'll all learn 00:09:40.000 at the right time and that when they 00:09:41.839 leave the room they're going to retain 00:09:42.800 pretty much what we imparted to them all 00:09:44.720 of which is demonstrably untrue uh and i 00:09:47.040 want to talk about that a little bit now 00:09:48.240 in more detail i mean obviously as we're 00:09:50.240 sort of walking around the world and 00:09:51.200 experiencing things that we experience 00:09:52.880 all that stuff in the natural world has 00:09:54.640 to be encoded in some way that it can be 00:09:56.320 stored in this electrochemical mass of 00:09:58.640 cells right so there's some encoding 00:10:00.160 process that has to take place we hope 00:10:01.920 that what gets in there is going to stay 00:10:03.519 in there over a long period of time but 00:10:05.040 i invite you to think about the fact 00:10:06.480 that we forget most of what we 00:10:08.399 experience 00:10:09.440 the current wisdom and psychology 00:10:10.880 suggests that what we consider the 00:10:11.839 psychological present what i mean by 00:10:13.200 that is like what now is for us is a 00:10:15.360 window of about three seconds in 00:10:16.480 duration so now lasts about three 00:10:18.240 seconds and now that now becomes then 00:10:19.920 and there's a new now and it happens so 00:10:21.440 in a typical waking day not of an 00:10:23.120 undergraduate because i know you guys 00:10:23.920 don't sleep but in a typical waking day 00:10:26.000 uh a a an an adult who gets a full night 00:10:28.320 of sleep will experience 20 000 now 00:10:30.959 most of which are completely forgotten 00:10:33.200 and you have to think that's probably a 00:10:34.399 good thing as i was walking from my 00:10:36.000 hotel over to campus today i could not 00:10:37.839 possibly recount the people that i 00:10:39.440 passed or describe most of the buildings 00:10:41.519 that i walked past i can't even remember 00:10:42.720 the street names right now part of that 00:10:43.920 has to do with my storage capacity as an 00:10:45.200 aging adult is diminishing but that's 00:10:46.320 another story 00:10:47.519 but there's no advantage to my 00:10:48.720 remembering those things right so you 00:10:50.560 have to ask the question as a teacher as 00:10:52.000 a learner what would motivate my brain 00:10:54.240 to expend the biological energy to 00:10:56.240 actually form a memory 00:10:57.920 i tell you what won't do that what 00:10:59.600 you're doing right now 00:11:01.680 i promise you there's a little truth in 00:11:02.720 advertising here i'm sorry patrick to 00:11:03.760 say this right right up front none of 00:11:04.880 you is going to learn anything from me 00:11:06.000 today at least not while you're in this 00:11:07.600 room and the reason is right now none of 00:11:09.760 you is busy enough to be learning 00:11:11.440 anything now what's interesting this is 00:11:13.680 considered a learning environment in 00:11:14.880 many institutions 00:11:16.399 in fact at texas we have lecture halls 00:11:18.160 just like this and we're so committed to 00:11:19.440 the idea we bolt the chairs to the floor 00:11:23.200 right but i have to tell you this is 00:11:24.560 this is a lousy learning environment 00:11:26.399 right because basically it presumes that 00:11:28.480 the way you're going to learn is by 00:11:30.079 watching what i do and listening to what 00:11:31.600 i say and look at the stuff that i put 00:11:33.040 up on this on the screen 00:11:34.720 what a ridiculous idea i mean given the 00:11:37.040 evidence that we have that that's not 00:11:38.000 the case right now that brings me to my 00:11:40.480 next thing which is why i ask you to sit 00:11:42.000 next to somebody that you've not yet met 00:11:43.040 i'm gonna ask you to do a task that for 00:11:44.160 me so if you have something to write 00:11:44.959 with would you take out something to 00:11:45.839 write with and if you're generous and 00:11:46.959 someone sitting next to you who looks 00:11:47.839 sort of confused give them something to 00:11:49.200 write with 00:11:52.240 okay i have a brief task for you now 00:11:56.560 by the way all of you sharing your 00:11:57.760 materials thank you very much 00:12:02.560 i assume all of you who are 00:12:03.440 undergraduates who are majoring in 00:12:04.480 something 00:12:06.000 and of course all of your faculty have 00:12:07.360 majored in something and have things 00:12:08.399 that you've committed your lives to what 00:12:09.680 i'd like you to do is take three minutes 00:12:11.600 and write down what you think to be the 00:12:13.279 three most interesting and far-reaching 00:12:15.680 ideas in your discipline 00:12:18.079 the three most interesting and 00:12:19.680 far-reaching ideas in your discipline 00:12:22.240 right three minutes and i'll come back 00:12:23.600 and get you in a minute 00:12:25.839 now i'd like you to take the most 00:12:27.120 interesting of those three ideas 00:12:29.279 and in about three minutes explain it to 00:12:31.360 the person sitting next to you 00:12:33.040 and if you're the person on the 00:12:34.480 listening end of the first part of this 00:12:35.600 conversation your task is to ask at 00:12:37.760 least two penetrating questions of the 00:12:39.440 person who's explaining this to you 00:12:41.120 right and then after about five minutes 00:12:43.519 i'm gonna ask you to switch and the 00:12:45.360 listener becomes the speaker and the 00:12:46.560 speaker becomes a listener and the other 00:12:48.160 person has the responsibility of asking 00:12:49.440 a couple of penetrating questions okay 00:12:50.880 so uh so i don't have to scream when 00:12:52.480 it's time to stop when it's time to 00:12:53.760 switch i'll stand up on the stage and 00:12:55.200 when it's time to stop i'll stay up on 00:12:56.160 the stage again so right now get to work 00:12:59.600 thank you i want to tell you what just 00:13:01.680 happened is the best thing will happen 00:13:02.720 this whole talk 00:13:05.519 and that should happen every day in 00:13:07.600 every class and all of you who are 00:13:09.360 explaining your ideas even ideas that 00:13:11.200 you think you know and understand really 00:13:12.560 well i would suggest have them modified 00:13:14.560 slightly by having to explain them to 00:13:15.839 somebody else not just because you want 00:13:16.959 to say them out loud not because you had 00:13:17.839 to put them into words but because 00:13:19.200 another person is looking at you and 00:13:21.040 looking like they're confused or they 00:13:22.639 get it or they want more or stop talking 00:13:25.040 to me or whatever their expression 00:13:26.000 happens to be and all of that is 00:13:28.000 influencing how you're interpreting the 00:13:29.360 information that you have in your head 00:13:30.720 now 00:13:31.680 we think that we do this all the time i 00:13:33.120 mean those of us in the hallowed halls 00:13:35.120 of academy you know we go to meetings 00:13:36.480 and we talk to people and we have these 00:13:37.440 conversations all the time but actually 00:13:39.120 this kind of conversational aspect of 00:13:41.040 learning and thinking has to be 00:13:42.720 practiced right i mean some of you are 00:13:44.240 better at this than others some of you 00:13:45.120 thought you know i've been sitting in 00:13:46.320 this class now i've been this major i've 00:13:47.360 taken four classes in this i've never 00:13:48.720 tried to explain this to another person 00:13:50.000 before i've just answered things on a 00:13:51.519 test 00:13:52.720 now 00:13:53.600 why is that 00:13:54.720 i mean not because there aren't 00:13:55.680 opportunities or opportunities are 00:13:56.800 different but again it gets back to the 00:13:58.560 idea that the notion is that i know 00:14:00.240 stuff you don't know stuff you're going 00:14:01.920 to come into my class i'm going to tell 00:14:03.199 you stuff then you'll know it then i'll 00:14:04.639 ask you what i told you you'll tell it 00:14:05.680 to me to prove that you know it and then 00:14:07.040 i'll give you an email walk out of the 00:14:08.079 room right except that's a terrible 00:14:10.480 model for learning because actually if 00:14:13.199 we have people experience anything new 00:14:14.959 whatever the discipline happens to be 00:14:16.480 and what we ask them to do is only the 00:14:17.920 things that we've explicitly shown them 00:14:19.120 how to do 00:14:20.160 it's possible for people to do something 00:14:21.519 that gives the appearance that they 00:14:22.800 understand when they actually understand 00:14:24.079 or understand anything 00:14:25.360 i mean one of i mean all of you who are 00:14:26.800 good students in this room by whatever 00:14:28.160 you know your parents or maybe calls a 00:14:29.199 good student know that one of the 00:14:30.959 hallmarks of being a good student is 00:14:32.560 compliance 00:14:34.399 right is following instructions and 00:14:36.079 making sure you listen carefully and 00:14:37.519 write down exactly what was said and 00:14:39.040 remember it 00:14:40.240 right but i'd like to suggest that well 00:14:42.320 that's that's certainly you know not a 00:14:44.000 bad thing but if you really want to 00:14:46.240 understand something and if a teacher or 00:14:48.000 a faculty wants you to understand 00:14:49.279 something then we're never really going 00:14:51.040 to know the extent to which you 00:14:51.839 understand it until we ask you to do 00:14:53.199 things that we've not explicitly shown 00:14:54.399 you how to do and that's what i want to 00:14:56.079 talk about next so we talked about 00:14:57.680 encoding storage the retrieval part of 00:14:59.920 course all of us have learned lots of 00:15:01.120 stuff at least we thought we learned and 00:15:02.959 now we can't recall it at all right 00:15:05.120 because we learned it in a very specific 00:15:06.560 context that had very specific cues and 00:15:08.720 all those cues are now gone and you know 00:15:10.320 one of the best day-to-day examples of 00:15:12.000 this whenever you see somebody that you 00:15:13.279 know i mean you don't know them well but 00:15:14.399 you know them enough to know their name 00:15:15.760 and then you encounter them in an 00:15:17.279 environment where you don't usually 00:15:18.560 encounter them you're in another city 00:15:20.240 and you see somebody you and their name 00:15:22.000 escapes you 00:15:23.120 why is that because their name is bound 00:15:25.040 to the context in which you experience 00:15:26.560 them most of the times when you 00:15:27.600 experience them and now the context is 00:15:28.800 different so now the memory is different 00:15:31.600 so if you think about what we're doing 00:15:32.720 when we're trying to learn something new 00:15:34.320 and we're learning to think better or 00:15:35.680 more effectively or whatever it happens 00:15:36.800 to be 00:15:37.760 context matters so how do we create 00:15:39.920 experiences so the retrieval likelihood 00:15:42.079 is increased and it has to do with what 00:15:44.240 kinds of experiences people have at the 00:15:45.600 time of encoding 00:15:47.040 uh often in the past couple years i've 00:15:48.240 been speaking to medical school faculty 00:15:49.680 and medical medical schools in the u.s 00:15:51.279 are some of the best worst examples of 00:15:53.759 non-interactive learning right you go to 00:15:55.759 your virology lecture and you have your 00:15:56.880 big biology book and you read about your 00:15:58.079 book or you go to violence or worse you 00:15:59.360 don't go to the variety lecture you just 00:16:00.560 watch the video online and you memorize 00:16:02.639 all that stuff so when you take your 00:16:03.600 boards you pass the biology thing and we 00:16:05.279 jam all this virology into your head 00:16:06.560 during your biology semester with a 00:16:07.759 thought in mind that when you're on in 00:16:09.279 your residency and you're on rounds and 00:16:10.560 a patient presents with a certain 00:16:11.839 combination of symptoms you know back in 00:16:13.279 your mind pull out your virology stuff 00:16:15.040 and bring it together to make some 00:16:16.560 diagnosis this patient brains don't work 00:16:18.320 anything like that 00:16:19.759 so you have to ask the question when 00:16:21.040 we're trying to put stuff in whether 00:16:22.480 it's into our own mind or somebody 00:16:23.519 else's mind right how many opportunities 00:16:25.519 are we providing for people to practice 00:16:27.519 getting it out 00:16:28.959 and i'll say it again or putting enough 00:16:30.320 putting it in how many opportunities 00:16:31.600 you're trying to people practice getting 00:16:32.720 it out 00:16:33.920 because we know now let me show you a 00:16:35.360 beautiful photograph now you know in 00:16:37.279 biology you know we know about the 00:16:38.240 genome and the biome and the proteome 00:16:39.920 and now in in neuroscience neuroscience 00:16:41.759 felt like it was getting shaded so 00:16:42.800 generous times a connectome and what 00:16:44.240 this beautiful photograph is is uh 00:16:46.480 neuronal pathways of axons that was 00:16:48.560 recorded with diffusion tension tensor 00:16:50.240 imaging which shows how axons connect 00:16:52.240 different parts of the brain to one 00:16:53.759 another which is a fascinating thing 00:16:54.800 because all this stuff is operating in 00:16:57.199 different parts of the brain that are 00:16:58.880 highly interconnected and actually 00:17:01.120 memories are distributed widely through 00:17:03.279 parts of the brain right a memory 00:17:04.799 doesn't live in one place every memory 00:17:06.480 that we have perhaps has a visual 00:17:08.079 component it has an auditory component 00:17:09.280 it may have a tactile component it may 00:17:10.480 have some other connections to some 00:17:11.839 other aspects of experiences or our 00:17:13.439 memories and all of that 00:17:15.439 this distribution needs to be 00:17:16.640 reconnected each time we recall a memory 00:17:19.199 so retrieving what we know requires as 00:17:21.359 much practice 00:17:22.559 as rehearsing what we know in a very 00:17:24.400 specific way and the more varied those 00:17:26.880 practice opportunities are the greater 00:17:28.480 the likelihood that the things that we 00:17:29.840 learn will be advantageously retrievable 00:17:31.440 at some point uh in the future 00:17:33.679 um 00:17:34.799 i i have the privilege of working at one 00:17:36.400 of the largest research universities on 00:17:37.919 the planet earth and not only that we 00:17:39.679 have one hell of a football team and uh 00:17:41.679 at least in some years we do but uh 00:17:43.840 a as you probably know if you watch uh 00:17:46.000 ncaa sports on television uh all 00:17:48.480 universities have little 10-second 00:17:50.480 snippets of advertising to tout how cool 00:17:52.799 the university is and how much everybody 00:17:54.000 should want to go to school there and 00:17:55.280 i'm going to show you one that i pulled 00:17:56.640 off the web uh about 10 years ago 00:17:58.160 unfortunately we don't show it more but 00:17:59.600 uh you'll appreciate it when i when i 00:18:01.760 show to you you can probably tell from 00:18:02.799 my accent i'm not from texas uh but i've 00:18:04.960 been there for very long time and i've 00:18:06.080 grown very fond of the place it has a 00:18:07.760 lovely oddness to it that's really 00:18:09.200 attractive um and i don't say anything 00:18:10.880 else about this ad i'm just going to 00:18:11.760 show you the ad and we'll talk about why 00:18:13.520 i love texas after you see this end 00:18:20.480 we don't claim to be able to change the 00:18:22.400 world 00:18:25.919 we just change people 00:18:29.760 and then they change the world 00:18:37.679 we're texas 00:18:40.240 we got steel guitar walter cronkite you 00:18:42.080 know breakfast tacos is fantastic uh 00:18:44.559 now i i just love the audacity of that 00:18:46.320 ad you know we just change people they 00:18:48.000 come here we just change them and they 00:18:49.280 gotta change the world now what this was 00:18:50.960 playing whenever i find myself in some 00:18:52.160 social gathering with the then president 00:18:53.200 and then provost i said you know that ad 00:18:54.240 we're playing now but we just change 00:18:55.200 people how do we know that 00:18:57.919 and how do we know we're changing the 00:18:58.960 way we're intending to change them and 00:19:00.400 of course the honest answer those both 00:19:01.360 those questions is we don't have any 00:19:02.240 idea right we bring into rooms like this 00:19:04.240 and we do stuff at them and then 00:19:05.679 everyone's trying to ask you to do stuff 00:19:06.960 and we let you leave assuming that we've 00:19:08.720 changed you and you've been changing 00:19:09.760 some fundamental way right all evidence 00:19:11.760 to the contrary sometimes so 00:19:13.840 if you're going to change somebody 00:19:15.600 they got to be a lot busier than you are 00:19:17.600 right now 00:19:18.799 right right now listening is seen to be 00:19:21.679 a learning activity listening is just 00:19:23.760 listening 00:19:24.720 if any of you learns anything from my 00:19:26.320 talk today the learning will start when 00:19:28.480 you're outside of this room and either 00:19:30.240 you recall something or something comes 00:19:31.440 up in a discussion and you start to talk 00:19:32.960 about it with somebody else or you start 00:19:34.000 to think well what would i do with a 00:19:35.120 syllabus given what i and you started 00:19:37.039 that's when the learning will start this 00:19:38.320 isn't the learning part 00:19:39.840 and typically because we're well 00:19:41.120 intended as teachers what we want to do 00:19:43.200 is set people up so carefully that when 00:19:45.200 they actually start doing something 00:19:46.480 we've gotten them ready to do it 00:19:48.640 thinking that the more ready-getting we 00:19:50.559 do the better they'll do it when they 00:19:52.160 actually when we actually give them a 00:19:53.039 chance to try and what i'd like to 00:19:54.640 suggest to you is just the opposite is 00:19:56.080 true that all the getting ready stuff is 00:19:58.720 missing one important feature of 00:20:00.240 learning and that is a learner's 00:20:02.160 generating activity 00:20:03.760 from which they gain 00:20:05.360 information from their own behavior 00:20:07.760 now we like to think and anyone who's 00:20:09.039 raised children thinks this all the time 00:20:10.720 i i want to protect my children from 00:20:12.320 hurt you know i don't i don't want them 00:20:14.080 to experience a sad moment in life right 00:20:16.000 i want to set them up and when our 00:20:17.120 daughter was dating it was the worst 00:20:18.480 period of my life 00:20:20.240 but but through all that time right i 00:20:21.919 think if i just set them up carefully 00:20:23.280 enough nothing will go wrong 00:20:25.600 and what i want to leave you with today 00:20:26.559 is one of my main points if nothing goes 00:20:28.400 wrong 00:20:29.200 it's unlikely you're going to learn 00:20:30.159 anything 00:20:31.520 that the nature of learning 00:20:33.440 is confronting dissonances between what 00:20:35.200 you either expect to have happen or what 00:20:36.400 you'd like to have happen and the 00:20:37.520 reality that you confront and resolving 00:20:39.760 those dissonances is what motivates a 00:20:41.520 brain to expend its biological energy to 00:20:43.120 actually form a memory or refine memory 00:20:45.840 so learning requires much more doing on 00:20:47.760 the part of the learner which is not a 00:20:48.960 new idea except typically the way we 00:20:51.520 characterize learning on the part of a 00:20:52.880 learner is having somebody go away and 00:20:54.320 write a paper or take a test or do a lab 00:20:56.960 experiment or those kinds of kinds of 00:20:58.480 things but if we set people up carefully 00:21:00.320 enough right we unfortunately set them 00:21:02.880 up in a way that the student especially 00:21:04.320 a good student learns i'm going to do 00:21:05.919 this without making many mistakes 00:21:08.640 i mean any of us who've ever supervised 00:21:09.919 a doctoral student knows the frustration 00:21:11.600 when the doctor is trying to work on 00:21:12.720 their dissertation looking to us like we 00:21:14.960 already know what's supposed to happen 00:21:16.000 if we just tell them they would just do 00:21:17.360 it right and to finally realize i don't 00:21:20.240 know how to do your dissertation if i 00:21:21.679 knew how to do it it wouldn't be worth a 00:21:22.960 dissertation right because then somebody 00:21:24.799 already figured it out right you're 00:21:25.919 trying to figure out i'm trying to 00:21:26.720 figure it out and that lack of direction 00:21:29.200 many students see as highly frustrating 00:21:31.200 and why would they not because all 00:21:32.960 through school i am the confusion 00:21:34.799 eliminator 00:21:36.000 right if i see a student who looks 00:21:37.360 confused and they have this look at my 00:21:38.400 face like oh look at this i mean i'm a 00:21:40.240 nice human being i want to come 00:21:41.440 unconfuse you that's my tendency so let 00:21:43.280 me explain it to you and think about 00:21:44.240 i've explained it to you now you're 00:21:45.120 smiling at me and i'm happy because 00:21:46.240 you're happy with me and now i think you 00:21:47.360 understand this except the only problem 00:21:48.720 is you didn't learn anything 00:21:50.480 right best comment i ever heard from one 00:21:51.760 of my former graduate students she was 00:21:53.039 teaching a piano class for non-majors 00:21:54.799 that was full of football players which 00:21:55.760 is fantastic and she was is this little 00:21:57.360 woman from from north carolina she's 00:21:58.720 just like this tall and so when she was 00:22:00.240 standing next to a piano and one of her 00:22:01.840 classes one of her students was sitting 00:22:03.039 at the piano they were at eye level you 00:22:04.080 know so so she's watching this guy try 00:22:05.760 to work out a finger into some little 00:22:06.880 naughty passage you know and so after 00:22:08.720 club is a great frustration she looks at 00:22:10.159 my students and says you know if you 00:22:11.039 were a good teacher you'd show me how to 00:22:12.159 do this and my student said yes i know 00:22:14.159 but because i'm an excellent teacher i'm 00:22:15.520 going to wait a few minutes while you 00:22:16.400 figure it out 00:22:17.679 now i thought that's astute right now 00:22:20.159 she said that 00:22:21.440 with the informed confidence that 00:22:22.880 actually he could figure it out 00:22:24.799 right just throw people into the weeds 00:22:26.400 and say good luck it'll be good for you 00:22:27.760 that's just mean right but 00:22:30.080 but the idea that most learners have in 00:22:32.000 school is confusion is something to be 00:22:33.840 avoided 00:22:35.280 right and the reason i go to school is 00:22:36.960 to eliminate my confusions 00:22:38.960 but all of us who work at research 00:22:40.799 institutions know 00:22:42.080 you know the government pays this 00:22:43.039 exorbitant salaries to be confused most 00:22:44.559 of the time 00:22:45.840 right i mean that's why we do what we're 00:22:47.760 doing because it's confusing and i don't 00:22:49.120 know the answer and that confusion is 00:22:50.640 not something to be avoided that's how i 00:22:52.240 figure out the answer is by working 00:22:54.080 through my confusions but if i as a 00:22:56.000 teacher i'm a person who's actually 00:22:57.520 working through your confusions with you 00:22:59.280 or for you you have an entirely 00:23:00.799 different experience in the room now if 00:23:03.039 if i had four hours to talk today 00:23:04.480 instead of just an hour and a half 00:23:06.480 i would say a lot about how wedded this 00:23:08.159 is to the idea of how we evaluate 00:23:10.080 students progress in a class right 00:23:12.240 because being asked to do things that 00:23:13.280 you've not explicitly shown been shown 00:23:14.960 how to do is understandably daunting 00:23:17.120 right because usually in a class if you 00:23:18.480 understand how to do something your 00:23:19.600 grades going down 00:23:21.280 and instead 00:23:22.400 to be in a place where it's valued to 00:23:24.559 not quite understand this but being able 00:23:26.480 to have strategies that allow you to 00:23:27.679 work through it even if you don't get to 00:23:29.200 the right answer but you have some 00:23:30.320 things that you know how to do to point 00:23:32.080 you toward the right answer that's a 00:23:33.440 different kind of assessment which again 00:23:34.640 i want to talk about we'll get to that 00:23:35.679 just a minute um 00:23:37.360 this is my favorite phrase i ever made 00:23:38.960 up uh i i think every learning 00:23:41.600 experience whether you're a teacher 00:23:42.720 planning a class or an institution 00:23:44.320 planning a curriculum or a degree should 00:23:46.080 start with that with a clear vivid 00:23:48.720 crystalline image of students as 00:23:50.720 accomplished learners and by that i mean 00:23:52.720 when we're finished with students and 00:23:54.559 they're finished with us what do we want 00:23:56.240 them to be like 00:23:57.760 now i choose my verbs very carefully i 00:23:59.520 i'm not using the lingo of curriculum it 00:24:01.200 says what do we want them to know and be 00:24:02.159 able to do what do we want them to be 00:24:03.679 like 00:24:04.720 because no one be able to do ignores 00:24:06.320 that there's an attitudinal component to 00:24:07.600 being successful in a discipline 00:24:09.520 right i mean if i want to be a bench 00:24:10.960 scientist and every time i set up an 00:24:12.240 experiment it doesn't work i want to 00:24:13.200 start throwing equipment across the room 00:24:14.400 i'm not going to be a very successful 00:24:15.360 bench scientist because most experiments 00:24:16.799 don't work now for many students that is 00:24:19.840 a bizarre thing to recognize because 00:24:22.159 when they were in biology lab they only 00:24:24.000 got credit if the experiment worked 00:24:26.640 right i mean we have labs all over our 00:24:28.559 campus where students come in they're 00:24:30.000 freshman biology majors or chemistry 00:24:31.360 majors or whatever and you do this thing 00:24:33.360 and if it doesn't come out right you 00:24:34.400 don't get credit now how is that an 00:24:35.520 experiment you know it's like a cake 00:24:37.200 recipe you know water water didn't turn 00:24:39.039 blue only half credit for chemistry 00:24:40.480 right i mean that's not why any of us 00:24:42.159 who do research do research right it's 00:24:43.840 because we don't know how it's going to 00:24:44.960 come out and part of being successful in 00:24:48.159 conducting inquiry like that is having 00:24:50.320 an attitude that allows you to deal with 00:24:52.240 the ambiguity and uncertainty of not 00:24:54.559 necessarily knowing what the right 00:24:55.600 answer is right but unfortunately we 00:24:57.840 inadvertently but very systematically 00:24:59.360 and often very successfully teach 00:25:01.120 students that not knowing what the 00:25:02.080 answer is is something to escape and 00:25:03.679 avoid at every opportunity so i just 00:25:06.400 wrote down adjectives that describe my 00:25:07.679 favorite students i would love rooms 00:25:08.720 full of people like this but i reject 00:25:09.919 out of hand the notion that babies come 00:25:11.200 from the factory like that right i mean 00:25:13.200 people learn to be 00:25:14.480 attentive 00:25:16.000 or they don't 00:25:17.360 and they learn to be meticulous about 00:25:18.720 the way they think or they don't 00:25:20.960 and they learn to be thoughtful not just 00:25:22.240 consider it thoughtful but thinking 00:25:23.279 thoughtful or they don't and the extent 00:25:24.640 to which any individual any of us in 00:25:26.159 this room and including all of us in 00:25:27.200 this room exhibits any of those 00:25:28.480 behaviors 00:25:29.600 varies depending on the environment in 00:25:30.960 which we find ourselves 00:25:32.400 right i mean there's some places we go 00:25:33.600 and we are 00:25:34.799 just really into it and focused and 00:25:36.720 listening hard 00:25:38.240 and other places it's really hard to 00:25:39.600 stay awake so it can't just be something 00:25:42.000 inherent in us 00:25:43.520 right there have to be things about the 00:25:44.880 environments that make it easier or 00:25:46.480 harder to demonstrate any one of those 00:25:48.320 charac one of those characteristics and 00:25:49.919 if you made up a list you'd probably 00:25:51.039 have your own set of characteristics and 00:25:52.159 not mine 00:25:53.200 but one thing i want to talk about from 00:25:54.320 the beginning is how do we make this 00:25:55.840 happen in a classroom right how do we 00:25:57.679 set this up in such a way that classes 00:25:59.520 facilitate the kinds of thinking and 00:26:01.200 puzzling and muddling that i'm talking 00:26:02.559 about 00:26:03.600 and you know when i first went to texas 00:26:05.919 i was i was asked to be on some 00:26:06.960 committee 00:26:07.919 for the state that was trying to plan 00:26:09.600 how they were going to evaluate primary 00:26:10.799 and secondary school teachers in texas 00:26:11.919 and i know anything about texas i just 00:26:12.880 got to text up a nice way to meet people 00:26:14.240 but it was one of these ridiculous 00:26:15.279 governmental committees that like 30 00:26:16.480 people on it is nowhere to get anything 00:26:17.440 done just ridiculous you know and uh so 00:26:19.679 we're talking about what what to do and 00:26:20.799 again i was obviously from out of state 00:26:22.640 and uh i said well you know it's like 00:26:24.640 1985 or 86. i said you know there are a 00:26:26.880 bunch of states united states have 00:26:27.840 actually kind of tackled this problem 00:26:28.799 before maybe we should get their 00:26:30.080 documents and look at them as a starting 00:26:31.440 place for our document in texas not 00:26:32.799 forgetting where i just moved 00:26:34.559 and uh after i suggested that it was a 00:26:36.080 long pause whenever we looked at the 00:26:37.039 floor a lot and the chair of the 00:26:38.080 committee looked at me and said 00:26:39.840 other states 00:26:41.919 like you know why would we consult that 00:26:43.279 so anyway i i i prevailed upon them to 00:26:45.840 allow me to do this and i and i looked 00:26:47.600 at all these evaluation systems of 00:26:48.960 evaluating teaching and what struck me 00:26:50.320 was how alike they all are which 00:26:51.520 shouldn't have been so surprising and 00:26:52.720 basically when teachers are evaluated 00:26:53.919 probably on the on the master campus too 00:26:55.919 that's the stuff that gets evaluated now 00:26:56.880 the language might be different or the 00:26:57.840 configuration but basically when you 00:26:58.799 evaluate teaching that's what that that 00:27:00.320 what what what you evaluate now of those 00:27:02.480 six things that are up there which thing 00:27:03.679 do you think is the least attention when 00:27:05.440 teachers are evaluated what do you think 00:27:06.799 gets the least attention i won't make 00:27:08.720 you guys out of it it's the first one 00:27:11.679 right now a lot of people think learning 00:27:12.880 environment no not instagram yourself 00:27:14.960 you have a degree in math okay check now 00:27:16.159 let's go look at your learning 00:27:16.720 environment now i want to do something 00:27:18.320 undergraduates a little truth in 00:27:19.279 advertising here it's possible to go 00:27:21.200 through a fine institution like mcmaster 00:27:23.279 pass all your classes you can make very 00:27:24.720 good grades maybe even have gold cords 00:27:26.320 around your regalia when you walk across 00:27:27.440 the stage 00:27:28.400 and not really understand your subject 00:27:29.440 matter very deeply 00:27:31.039 right now 00:27:32.480 that's worth thinking about not just in 00:27:34.080 terms of your own education but thinking 00:27:36.400 about what kinds of experiences are 00:27:37.679 required for me to actually know where 00:27:40.320 the gaps are in my own understanding 00:27:42.240 right and that's the task and this is 00:27:43.600 making the understanding so what i mean 00:27:44.960 by knowledge matter first of all is is 00:27:46.960 understanding the discipline from 00:27:47.919 outside your expertise so i was asking 00:27:49.120 you to talk to one another about things 00:27:50.320 that are interesting and important about 00:27:51.120 your subject matter practicing doing 00:27:52.480 that changes the way you think about 00:27:54.320 what's important about your discipline 00:27:55.440 what always strikes me when i ask 00:27:56.799 audiences like this to write down the 00:27:58.159 three most important and far-reaching 00:27:59.520 aspects of this one is how many people 00:28:00.960 don't have them at the ready 00:28:02.799 because my thought is what are you 00:28:03.840 thinking about then 00:28:05.039 right well i got this little trivial 00:28:06.559 thing that i've been spending time on 00:28:07.360 this completely disconnected from the 00:28:08.240 main idea because everybody who's an 00:28:09.440 expert at everything in this room knows 00:28:11.200 the more you learn about a discipline 00:28:12.399 the more you realize that this one's 00:28:13.440 really based on a very small number of 00:28:14.640 very fundamental ideas right now as a 00:28:17.279 novice you see a new discipline and you 00:28:18.559 see this morass of data you think my god 00:28:20.799 how can i possibly remember all that 00:28:22.240 stuff and you watch a really learned 00:28:24.000 person a discipline give a lecture with 00:28:25.200 no notes and they're calling references 00:28:26.480 out of the air and think my god how 00:28:27.760 could you remember that i couldn't 00:28:28.720 possibly remember that and the answer to 00:28:30.399 that is you're right you couldn't 00:28:31.200 possibly remember that but it has 00:28:32.640 nothing to do with the inherent 00:28:33.440 limitations of your memory store the 00:28:35.120 reason that person can remember all that 00:28:36.480 stuff and you seemingly can't is because 00:28:38.399 that person's information is organized 00:28:40.399 in memory entirely different from yours 00:28:42.799 and that organization is based on very 00:28:44.960 fundamental ideas that permeate the 00:28:47.600 discipline whatever this one happens to 00:28:48.799 be so 00:28:50.720 if you think about what you're teaching 00:28:51.600 in a class and what you're learning in a 00:28:52.799 class is everything really focused on 00:28:54.640 the fundamental structure of the subject 00:28:56.159 and what i mean by the first thing broad 00:28:57.840 underlying persons are intellectually 00:28:58.880 interesting i think that speaks for 00:28:59.679 itself intellectually introducing and 00:29:01.600 functionally valuable and my 00:29:02.399 functionality i don't think you can make 00:29:03.440 money with it necessarily i mean you can 00:29:04.799 think with it 00:29:06.080 right to know 00:29:08.080 the date that rousseau died 00:29:10.399 could be an interesting date or it could 00:29:12.320 be absolutely trivial depending on what 00:29:14.080 it's connected to 00:29:15.440 now if the only thing i ask you as your 00:29:17.039 teacher is to tell me the date and 00:29:18.960 that's as far as you can go with it why 00:29:20.320 would i expect you to think that's at 00:29:21.440 all interesting 00:29:22.960 right and often that's what happens when 00:29:24.720 we evaluate learners right we don't go 00:29:26.480 all the way to the application of the 00:29:27.840 thing that we're learning the part that 00:29:28.960 actually makes what you're learning 00:29:30.000 interesting and meaningful we just go up 00:29:31.679 to the starting point with the idea in 00:29:32.799 mind let's just get the dates in your 00:29:34.240 memory and then in a couple years we'll 00:29:36.080 pull those out 00:29:37.279 right and see how they connect to the 00:29:39.039 culture in europe during that time well 00:29:40.559 you know what a couple years from now 00:29:41.600 that's going to be gone 00:29:43.360 and it's gone because it's disconnected 00:29:44.960 to the other things that are already in 00:29:45.919 your head okay um 00:29:48.240 you know i i see some people in the 00:29:50.080 audience are my age and 00:29:51.919 younger uh but people were my age or my 00:29:53.760 contemporaries here you might remember 00:29:54.960 when we were first introduced to desktop 00:29:56.960 computing 00:29:57.919 uh and how cool that was you know in in 00:30:00.240 the in the late 70s early 80s that you 00:30:02.000 could actually have a computer on your 00:30:04.240 desk i mean it was just so cool you know 00:30:06.320 and i remember getting my first computer 00:30:07.600 was in the box somebody delivered to my 00:30:08.640 desk 00:30:09.520 in my office and i opened it up i was so 00:30:10.880 excited you know and i pulled out the 00:30:12.080 manual for the thing which is like that 00:30:13.679 thick you know 00:30:14.880 and i turn the manual and it says 00:30:16.320 setting up your computer and it says 00:30:17.919 step one boot the 00:30:20.840 system it's 00:30:22.640 it's in the box you know 00:30:24.640 right now now what what well-intentioned 00:30:27.279 human being would write as step one 00:30:30.240 boot the system 00:30:31.520 well i tell you who somebody for whom 00:30:33.440 booting the system is his first 00:30:35.120 conscious thought when he works on his 00:30:36.720 computer 00:30:37.840 and of course the cpu needs to be 00:30:39.520 plugged into the monitor and of course 00:30:41.279 the floppy disk goes in with the notch 00:30:42.640 on the right and of course it's supposed 00:30:43.840 to be making that sound when you close 00:30:45.200 the little thing 00:30:46.159 unless you don't know any of that right 00:30:48.080 and then this is just mysterious 00:30:50.480 right now if you ask yourself the 00:30:52.080 question right whatever the subject 00:30:53.120 matter happens to be what does somebody 00:30:54.480 actually need to know and do to 00:30:56.880 understand what's really important about 00:30:58.080 the subject matter often we think well 00:31:00.000 i've got to get them through all this 00:31:00.960 preliminary stuff first and then we'll 00:31:03.039 get to the interesting stuff and the 00:31:04.399 person who wrote the booth the system 00:31:05.520 thing probably thought let's just get 00:31:06.640 right to it 00:31:07.760 except i don't i don't know that the 00:31:09.200 floppy disk needs to be in the computer 00:31:11.039 you know i don't know that the keyboard 00:31:12.320 plugs in there i didn't know there's a 00:31:14.000 separate on switch for the monitor right 00:31:16.000 so all of those things that i don't know 00:31:17.520 now keep me from having any opportunity 00:31:19.440 to get into whatever i'm trying to do 00:31:20.640 and trying to learn even though i'm 00:31:21.520 motivated to do that 00:31:23.120 um 00:31:25.120 i have a way to make this all more 00:31:26.559 succinct if you think about those six 00:31:28.159 things where those six things really 00:31:29.840 aren't six things there's only four 00:31:31.200 because the three that i have 00:31:31.919 highlighted are actually one thing or 00:31:33.360 potentially one thing right what what 00:31:35.840 what are the 00:31:37.120 under the underlying fundamental 00:31:38.480 principles of the discipline 00:31:40.159 those should make those should become 00:31:41.679 the goals of instruction practicing 00:31:43.200 those fundamental online and the only 00:31:45.200 way we'll know whether we've 00:31:46.000 accomplished what we set out to do with 00:31:47.840 learners is by evaluating whether or not 00:31:50.159 they can actually apply those things 00:31:51.360 that we've taught them in ways that 00:31:52.480 we've not explicitly shown them how to 00:31:53.519 do 00:31:54.799 and all of that starts with the 00:31:56.320 assessment all that starts by defining a 00:31:58.559 priori this is how i know somebody will 00:32:00.799 be able to 00:32:01.840 this is how i'll know that somebody 00:32:02.799 understands this thing what i'm teaching 00:32:04.080 them to do because they will behave this 00:32:05.600 way under these circumstances 00:32:07.600 um 00:32:08.640 i've shown this slide a long time but it 00:32:09.679 always is a hit uh i brought some data 00:32:11.440 from a typical freshman learner at the 00:32:12.880 university of texas at austin amount 00:32:14.240 learned is on the 00:32:15.679 y-axis one semester of time is going 00:32:17.200 across the axis 00:32:24.960 yeah there's midterms uh there's fine 00:32:27.279 final exams now 00:32:29.360 now there's there's a lot wrong with 00:32:30.559 that picture right not the least of 00:32:32.080 which is when you're right here and it's 00:32:33.760 two o'clock in the morning 00:32:35.440 and the test is at eight 00:32:37.039 and you're out of coffee and there's 00:32:38.240 just a few no-dose crumbs in the bottom 00:32:39.600 of your jar and you got two more 00:32:41.039 chapters to read and you turn the page 00:32:42.880 and it says for further interest turn to 00:32:44.720 appendix d you don't think well my let 00:32:46.559 me just take a moment and see what's in 00:32:47.679 i i don't have time for that right i 00:32:49.360 gotta i got this thing not 00:32:51.360 right 00:32:52.240 now that's part of what's wrong with it 00:32:53.440 the other thing is wrong with it is 00:32:54.799 there are such infrequent opportunities 00:32:56.480 to practice 00:32:57.760 using the information in various 00:32:59.440 contexts 00:33:00.559 right so the likelihood of its being 00:33:02.080 retrievable over the long term 00:33:03.440 advantageously is really really really 00:33:05.279 really really really really low 00:33:07.519 right now if you think about most 00:33:09.039 assessments 00:33:10.480 in higher education certainly they tend 00:33:12.000 to be 00:33:12.799 really high in magnitude really low in 00:33:14.320 frequency right they don't happen very 00:33:16.240 often and when they happen they matter a 00:33:17.519 ton 00:33:18.720 now how do you fix that well one thing 00:33:21.279 is 00:33:22.080 you have to flatten out this curve right 00:33:24.559 that there are things that are happening 00:33:25.760 all the time not any one of which 00:33:27.919 requires you know beautiful performance 00:33:30.880 so you can be messy and muddle and 00:33:33.279 confused in ways that teach you 00:33:35.200 something 00:33:36.159 right one of my favorite phrases that i 00:33:37.600 made up last year uh because i was 00:33:39.360 trying to talk to some group about 00:33:40.320 confusion and how good confusion was but 00:33:41.919 not just confusion of itself but 00:33:43.279 strategic confusion 00:33:44.960 you know i as your teacher 00:33:46.799 create strategic confusions for you 00:33:49.039 right that one right there and i want to 00:33:50.640 tell you if you want a model if you're a 00:33:52.080 faculty member you're thinking i've 00:33:52.960 never thought about this before how can 00:33:54.080 i get a model for that uh 00:33:56.480 go to the app store look at the most 00:33:58.320 popular video games on the app store and 00:34:00.480 buy one 00:34:01.919 right 00:34:02.720 i mean i'm 59 years old 00:34:05.200 i sit on airplanes 00:34:07.600 flipping birds out of a slingshot 00:34:10.159 to kill little green pigs who are trying 00:34:11.839 to steal the bird's eggs now what is 00:34:13.359 wrong with me you know that that would 00:34:15.199 motivate me to do that and by the way 00:34:16.639 i've been doing this for years you know 00:34:18.320 now why is that because you know the 00:34:19.760 authors of angry birds understand how 00:34:21.520 human beings learn 00:34:23.280 so what happens in the beginning of 00:34:24.239 angry birds right there's one bird one 00:34:26.399 pig all right almost no matter what you 00:34:28.480 do you could sneeze on the thing it'll 00:34:29.679 kill the pig right great but then now 00:34:32.079 now there's now there are more pigs and 00:34:33.918 then after a while one pig's under a 00:34:35.359 piece of wood 00:34:36.800 and now there's a different bird that 00:34:38.159 does a different thing 00:34:39.520 and all of this is strategically 00:34:41.440 introduced in a way that creates 00:34:43.839 challenges for challenges for me that 00:34:45.359 are inherently unsolvable 00:34:47.599 immediately 00:34:48.639 but they're solvable in the relative 00:34:50.159 near term 00:34:52.000 now to make this happen right 00:34:55.280 you got to do that 00:34:56.719 there have to be strategically organized 00:34:59.040 challenges that are not immediately 00:35:00.640 solvable but solvable in the relative 00:35:02.400 near term i mean i don't know what this 00:35:04.000 is what the statistic is in canada but 00:35:05.359 in the in the u.s over 50 of people who 00:35:08.079 finish all their courses and pass their 00:35:09.280 comprehensive exams never finish their 00:35:11.200 their just their dissertations and why 00:35:12.560 is that well where's the approximation 00:35:14.880 of that you know you're giving doing 00:35:17.599 assignments blow your mind into a 20 00:35:18.880 page paper here and there and then 00:35:20.000 somebody says okay go discover something 00:35:21.760 bring something back when you got 00:35:22.480 something to show me 00:35:23.680 you know how do i do that 00:35:25.680 right so again if we really want to set 00:35:27.440 people up in such a way that they're 00:35:28.480 able to apply what they know in ways 00:35:29.920 that are meaningful and manageable and 00:35:32.320 not discouraging that's something that 00:35:33.920 has to be practiced all on the way 00:35:35.200 because again there's an attitudinal 00:35:36.320 component to developing expertise right 00:35:38.000 it's not just knowing stuff is do you 00:35:39.520 have the right attitude about that when 00:35:40.720 you're confused how do you feel about 00:35:42.400 that what do you do in this in it when 00:35:44.240 you're in a state of confusion right how 00:35:45.920 do you adapt to the circumstances that 00:35:47.440 you're confronted with all those 00:35:48.320 questions that you could say more than i 00:35:49.839 can 00:35:50.560 um 00:35:51.280 okay so now you were watching the 00:35:52.640 harvard mit people make in front of them 00:35:54.079 now we get to make fun of ourselves i'd 00:35:55.359 like everyone to solve for x in your 00:35:57.200 head go sitting out loud just solve this 00:35:59.119 equation for x 00:36:00.640 i'll give you about 15 seconds shouldn't 00:36:02.079 take more than that 00:36:05.280 okay you put your minute i i have to 00:36:07.280 make a little teaching moment here 00:36:08.320 they're like what like 200 people in 00:36:09.280 this room and like like three guys raise 00:36:11.440 their hand and it's it's like when 00:36:12.640 you're not in fourth grade now the 00:36:14.160 question i ask all the faculty is why 00:36:16.160 the hell don't you raise your hand and 00:36:17.520 the answer that is the same reason your 00:36:18.800 students don't raise your hand when you 00:36:19.680 ask a question 00:36:21.920 because 00:36:26.800 that was your favorite part of the talk 00:36:27.839 wasn't it 00:36:29.839 now think about that for a minute right 00:36:32.320 now i know many of you know how to do 00:36:33.760 this so so what's the problem well the 00:36:35.440 problem is what if you raise your hand 00:36:37.040 and i called on you and you said three 00:36:38.640 eighths and i said well actually it's 00:36:40.000 not three eighths you know then what 00:36:42.400 well then nothing except if you did 00:36:44.079 raise your hand and i did call on you 00:36:45.200 and you did say three eighths i said 00:36:46.079 well she's not three that would be the 00:36:47.200 defining event of this week 00:36:49.920 you know you'll be late in bed in the 00:36:51.119 dark on saturday night going god why'd i 00:36:52.640 raise my hand on monday right 00:36:54.480 now 00:36:55.280 that that is that is intensely perverse 00:36:57.440 reaction to that except it's 00:36:58.800 understandable you have a reaction 00:36:59.760 because that's what school has taught 00:37:00.880 you right when i when i first started 00:37:03.040 teaching teaching school in public 00:37:04.640 school i was naive enthusiastic and 00:37:07.040 stupid and i found out that the 00:37:08.480 elementary school next to the high 00:37:09.359 school campus where i was directing 00:37:10.320 orchestra band didn't have enough music 00:37:11.839 teacher hours for the kindergartners and 00:37:12.960 first graders to have music so again 00:37:14.240 being stupid enthusiastic i got a 00:37:15.599 planning period you know what i'm gonna 00:37:16.640 do with that so i volunteered two days a 00:37:18.079 week to go to elementary school and 00:37:19.280 teach music to kn1 kids right so the 00:37:21.119 music teacher had regular classrooms so 00:37:22.240 i had a cart an audio visual cart like 00:37:23.680 that one uh except it was green that uh 00:37:25.680 had a record player on it you remember 00:37:27.119 records like really big cds and uh and 00:37:28.640 so i rolled this card around and had a 00:37:30.240 guitar on it it's a rhythm instruments 00:37:31.359 and the kids will see me roll this room 00:37:32.400 and say oh god it's time for me to say 00:37:33.280 what do you want to say yeah let's sing 00:37:34.640 we'll listen to music yeah beethoven 00:37:35.839 yeah he's good 00:37:37.200 they they were uninhibitedly 00:37:38.800 undiscriminatingly positive about 00:37:40.000 anything i wanted to do 00:37:41.280 and i would pose a question say i want 00:37:42.960 someone to raise your hands oh 00:37:43.839 everybody's hanging up they know i was 00:37:44.720 gonna ask i don't care pick me you know 00:37:47.599 now 00:37:48.880 i've now been teaching long enough 00:37:50.720 that those same children 00:37:52.240 have grown to be young adults 00:37:55.280 and they've become my stressed 00:37:57.359 oppressed 00:37:59.520 great anxious 00:38:01.200 graduate students 00:38:02.640 and now i'm sitting around a seminar 00:38:03.599 table i say i like someone who talks 00:38:04.800 just a minute everybody looks at the 00:38:05.520 table 00:38:07.040 you know like taking notes like god 00:38:08.000 don't call on me i'm thinking what 00:38:09.119 happened to you what took that bright 00:38:10.800 open with it pick me i don't know what 00:38:12.079 the hell's going on let's try anyway you 00:38:13.599 know 00:38:14.480 what happened to you and the only 00:38:15.599 uncommon variable i can think ran 00:38:16.720 through all their past experiences they 00:38:17.839 all went to school 00:38:20.720 right and school took that and turned it 00:38:22.400 into well look out right and 00:38:25.119 very effectively very systematically 00:38:27.040 completely unintentionally 00:38:29.119 right i mean what do we tell you all the 00:38:30.480 time be creative but be sure you get 00:38:32.640 this one right 00:38:33.760 well that's not the way creativity works 00:38:35.359 right i mean okay anyway so we're back 00:38:37.040 to this again so somebody who raised 00:38:38.000 their hand would you raise your hand 00:38:38.800 again so i could would you tell me 00:38:40.079 answer three two three two three three 00:38:41.839 over two years after one and a half 00:38:43.200 right would you tell me your name 00:38:44.240 brandon brent 00:38:46.960 which is correct now unless brandon or 00:38:48.560 anybody else how did you get to that 00:38:49.839 from there 00:38:50.800 well multiply three over three four by 00:38:52.880 two 00:38:53.680 and why do you do that 00:38:55.920 yeah this is the universal symbol for 00:38:57.200 this equation yeah you do that right 00:38:59.200 okay so so brandon says correctly that 00:39:00.720 you do that to the to the thing on the 00:39:02.480 other side right and then you let you go 00:39:03.839 six over four or three or two and you're 00:39:04.880 reducing it one and now okay so here's 00:39:06.320 my question i would ask brandon and 00:39:07.359 everybody else if you've already 00:39:08.000 answered somebody else why do you why do 00:39:09.680 you do that why do you invert the 00:39:10.640 divisor 00:39:12.880 yeah crickets right okay now 00:39:14.960 i would say so so you don't feel bad for 00:39:16.720 the past i don't know 18 years i give 00:39:18.160 the opening talk on teaching for the 00:39:19.200 faculty of texas for the new faculty or 00:39:20.880 orientation techniques we probably hire 00:39:22.000 120 new faculty a year 00:39:23.599 and i put this slide up now i got 120 00:39:25.760 you know people with terminal degrees in 00:39:27.200 the audience and you know there's 00:39:28.079 somebody raise your hand and tell me 00:39:29.119 what the answer is and five guys raise 00:39:30.160 your hand they're all in the math 00:39:30.720 department uh 00:39:32.320 and and i asked him the same thing right 00:39:33.760 now brandon says right what why why do 00:39:35.599 you have to divide because that's what 00:39:36.640 you do to do it right now the best thing 00:39:38.800 i ever got i was in a room full of 00:39:39.760 fitness once i wrote this equation on 00:39:40.800 the board would say all that right and i 00:39:42.400 and i said why why do you invert the 00:39:43.440 divisor and this kid will realize if you 00:39:45.040 don't get it wrong 00:39:47.280 what better rationale does one need than 00:39:49.119 that right 00:39:50.880 now for all of you mathematically 00:39:52.240 inclined in here you recognize that the 00:39:53.760 rationale for inverting the divisor is 00:39:55.040 the only interesting thing about that 00:39:56.160 equation 00:39:57.920 right which is unlike the way 00:39:59.680 mathematicians think about numbers by 00:40:00.880 the way i mean this this symbol that 00:40:02.480 doesn't exist in any mathematics books 00:40:03.839 except in school right it's not the way 00:40:05.680 things work in real math right now the 00:40:07.839 thing to consider is this 00:40:09.280 if the goal of an institution is to get 00:40:10.720 rooms full of disparate people getting 00:40:12.640 the right answer for that one way to do 00:40:14.960 it is to put lots of questions just like 00:40:17.359 that with different numbers in them and 00:40:18.640 teach people to go invert and multiply 00:40:19.920 multiply multiply multiply and you'll 00:40:21.520 get everybody getting the right answer 00:40:23.599 without 00:40:24.400 any requirement that anybody knows what 00:40:25.520 they're doing 00:40:27.119 and in school we're really good at that 00:40:30.000 and students who are good at school are 00:40:31.520 really good at that 00:40:32.880 now i'm not saying that the things are 00:40:34.160 usually exclusive that if you can do 00:40:35.200 that you then you must not know what 00:40:36.640 you're doing i'm just saying it's 00:40:37.599 possible to not know what you're doing 00:40:39.599 right and and my argument today is it 00:40:41.599 shouldn't be possible to not know what 00:40:42.640 you're doing and still get the right 00:40:43.520 answer right but as long as i'm asking 00:40:45.440 you to do things that i've explicitly 00:40:46.560 shown you how to do and you've been 00:40:47.760 paying attention and you're motivated to 00:40:49.440 learn well why wouldn't you get the 00:40:50.720 right answer right but if i change my 00:40:53.520 goal and my goal is no longer to teach 00:40:55.119 you how to get the right answer it's 00:40:56.560 teaching you how to be optimally 00:40:57.920 confused 00:40:59.520 and to use your confusion in a way that 00:41:02.079 causes you to think differently about 00:41:03.520 the thing that you're doing that's a 00:41:04.880 whole different goal now 00:41:06.960 there's there's a downside for this for 00:41:08.240 faculty because as students you all know 00:41:10.079 i don't like being confused 00:41:12.000 and for somebody to say i'm going to 00:41:13.200 evaluate you by having you come in and 00:41:14.800 i'm going to ask you something i haven't 00:41:15.680 shown you how to do what's the student 00:41:16.800 say what the hell's wrong with you this 00:41:18.240 is school you're supposed to show me how 00:41:19.359 to do it and then i'll do it right so 00:41:21.440 this requires a shift in thinking on 00:41:23.359 everybody's part right but that only 00:41:25.839 works 00:41:27.040 if the way we evaluate and the way we 00:41:29.520 give credit isn't based solely on 00:41:32.079 getting the right answer that i've shown 00:41:33.040 you how to get okay and i well i don't 00:41:34.800 have time for that at all 00:41:36.160 um 00:41:37.040 okay so i so i i i have two thoughts uh 00:41:39.520 to kind of leave you with before we open 00:41:40.640 the floor for questions okay and one is 00:41:42.240 this as a teacher you're a learner too 00:41:45.200 i mean i'm doing a terrible job of 00:41:46.640 teaching today because i don't know you 00:41:48.480 all well enough to know what's going on 00:41:50.240 in your head 00:41:51.599 and if i'm going to teach you 00:41:52.319 effectively i need to know what you're 00:41:53.599 doing 00:41:54.480 what's your thinking 00:41:55.760 and so i have to provide opportunities 00:41:57.359 every day that reveal to you and to me 00:42:00.240 gaps in your thinking that might not be 00:42:01.680 visible 00:42:02.480 right anything well goodness you can't 00:42:03.839 do that in class of 200. of course you 00:42:05.040 can we just did it today 00:42:07.040 right because if you were in my class 00:42:08.400 today i would take up the things that 00:42:09.599 you wrote and i would look at them not 00:42:11.440 to grade i'd look at them just to get an 00:42:13.040 idea of where people's heads are in the 00:42:14.480 room 00:42:15.359 right and i might actually talk to a 00:42:17.839 particular person because i thought they 00:42:18.880 wrote something particularly insightful 00:42:20.160 on the thing i had them write for five 00:42:21.359 minutes that day or i might find 00:42:22.960 somebody else who's completely in the 00:42:24.000 weeds and go find them as well to 00:42:26.160 unweedify them and try to help them get 00:42:27.839 to a place where they understand this a 00:42:28.720 little bit better right but i can't do 00:42:30.880 that if i'm just talking and you're all 00:42:32.240 just sitting there because i don't know 00:42:33.680 enough about what you're doing so the 00:42:35.040 first central idea you're a learner too 00:42:37.040 and then the the bigger essential idea 00:42:38.960 is learning is error correction 00:42:40.960 and by error correction i don't mean 00:42:42.319 students making a mistake and my 00:42:43.520 correcting it i mean students making 00:42:45.200 mistakes and then working through their 00:42:46.640 own problems 00:42:48.000 right 00:42:48.720 so rather than my being the person who 00:42:50.079 solves it for you or for shows you or or 00:42:52.079 who shows you what you did wrong i'm the 00:42:53.520 person who has set up 00:42:55.520 experiences where you can be 00:42:56.640 advantageously confused 00:42:58.560 and muddle 00:43:00.160 because the model is where the learning 00:43:01.280 happens right we and we don't typically 00:43:02.720 value muddling uh many students see 00:43:05.359 muddling as a waste of time and again 00:43:07.599 they don't see that as a waste of time 00:43:08.560 because they inherently see it as a 00:43:09.599 waste of time we taught them to see it 00:43:11.200 as a waste of time because their 00:43:13.280 thinking coming into a learning 00:43:14.400 environment is i need to get from here 00:43:15.599 to the right answer as quickly and 00:43:16.720 efficiently as i possibly can and 00:43:18.160 learning is not efficient 00:43:19.839 learning is a mess 00:43:22.160 and all of us know if you've ever 00:43:23.599 written a book or conducted a good 00:43:24.880 experiment or written a grant that got 00:43:26.400 funded or whatever we know it's a mess 00:43:29.839 right it's not linear it's not clean 00:43:32.240 it's frustrating it's all those things 00:43:34.160 right but the way we teach learners to 00:43:36.160 develop those attitudes has to involve 00:43:38.160 their having approximations of those 00:43:39.920 experiences in the classes that they 00:43:41.760 take all the all the time except that 00:43:43.760 can't happen if we're only evaluating 00:43:45.280 them based on their known stuff right i 00:43:47.599 mean many of my colleagues ask questions 00:43:48.880 like you know on on a test tell me about 00:43:51.040 your most interesting failure at this 00:43:53.599 now most of us would think how could a 00:43:54.800 failure be interesting 00:43:56.160 well that that they're really 00:43:57.760 interesting if you actually cook them 00:43:59.040 right right but if failure means the 00:44:01.119 answer was supposed to be that and i 00:44:02.000 wrote that well it's not very 00:44:03.280 interesting right but if you think how 00:44:04.720 could i misconstrue the cause of seasons 00:44:07.119 on the earth as being distance when it 00:44:08.640 really isn't distance but the angle of 00:44:10.000 light waves striking the atmosphere now 00:44:11.760 i've got something interesting to talk 00:44:12.560 about right because now i have a reason 00:44:14.960 for my misconstrual because i do know 00:44:17.280 from my own experience that as i become 00:44:19.119 as i move closer to a heat source i feel 00:44:21.200 more of the heat 00:44:22.400 right but doing that with the earth with 00:44:24.560 the sun would be like 00:44:26.560 mine now taking two steps that way to a 00:44:28.800 heater that's in new jersey you know 00:44:30.880 it's not going to make any difference 00:44:32.480 but once you understand that you think 00:44:33.760 about the problem entirely differently 00:44:35.200 and enough experiences like that get you 00:44:36.960 to think about problems in general 00:44:38.560 entirely differently and i think any of 00:44:40.560 us who teach have that as an ultimate 00:44:42.319 goal we'd like people to be in a place 00:44:43.920 where confronting problems is not 00:44:45.839 something that stops you in your tracks 00:44:47.359 but something that prompts you to think 00:44:49.040 about things that you might not have 00:44:50.000 thought about before so becoming 00:44:51.440 comfortable with that idea that i don't 00:44:52.720 know the answer i don't know what to do 00:44:54.240 and now i've got to try out some things 00:44:55.359 and see what happens is an important 00:44:57.119 feature of every learning experience for 00:44:58.480 every learner at every age whatever that 00:45:00.079 happens to be 00:45:01.359 i can go on for days but i won't i'll 00:45:03.200 spare you uh and i was asked to leave 00:45:04.800 some type of questions and i see that we 00:45:05.839 have 14 minutes left so i will do that 00:45:07.280 if anybody has to be somewhere else i 00:45:08.480 won't be offended if you leave before 00:45:09.440 the questioning time uh but let me thank 00:45:11.520 uh 00:45:12.319 mcmaster university the president all 00:45:14.319 the people who've been involved in my 00:45:15.200 coming here staff faculty everybody 00:45:16.880 thank you so much and thank you for your 00:45:17.760 attention today thanks",

teaching professor elizabeth chateau 00:01:25.360 massey distinguished fellow in teacher 00:01:26.720 education and director of the center for 00:01:28.799 music learning 00:01:30.560 he also directs the psychology of 00:01:31.920 learning program at the coburn 00:01:33.200 conservatory of music in los angeles 00:01:35.920 the most recent of mtna's francis clark 00:01:38.079 keyboard pedagogy award 00:01:40.000 most recent recipient of that award dr 00:01:42.320 duke has directed 00:01:44.320 national research efforts under under 00:01:45.759 the sponsorship of such organizations as 00:01:47.920 the national piano foundation and the 00:01:49.759 international suzuki institute 00:01:52.159 his research on human learning and 00:01:53.680 behavior spans multiple disciplines 00:01:55.759 including motor skill learning cognitive 00:01:58.000 psychology and neuroscience 00:02:00.479 a former studio musician and public 00:02:02.320 school music teacher he has worked 00:02:04.159 closely with children at risk both in 00:02:06.240 the public schools and through the 00:02:07.840 juvenile justice system 00:02:09.919 please join me in welcoming robert duke 00:02:15.200 thank you so much thanks patrick 00:02:18.640 thank you it's so nice of you all to 00:02:19.840 come uh patrick told me this is the 00:02:21.360 largest crowd you've had for this and i 00:02:22.480 told him i try not to blow it uh uh this 00:02:24.720 is a wonderful series and i i want to 00:02:26.239 commend uh mcmaster for initiating 00:02:28.560 something like this to sort of provoke 00:02:30.000 thought which i hope i will do with all 00:02:31.760 of you today i want to ask before i 00:02:32.800 start there are many cables that i could 00:02:34.239 be wearing but i want to make sure that 00:02:35.040 everyone back and hear me without a 00:02:36.000 microphone is that okay good great um 00:02:38.560 this instruction is meant for you uh so 00:02:40.959 i know this may be a little chaotic and 00:02:42.400 i'm going to take the risk anyway if 00:02:44.160 you're sitting next to only people you 00:02:45.440 know i'd like you to stand up and shift 00:02:47.200 in your row so you're next to someone 00:02:48.560 that you've not yet met so all you while 00:02:50.400 you stand up and do that right now 00:02:52.800 okay thank you um 00:02:54.959 that didn't take as long as i thought um 00:02:58.000 now i'm going to give you an assignment 00:02:58.879 to do for just a minute but before i do 00:03:00.480 that i'd like to play a short video 00:03:03.200 with some music on it because i'm a 00:03:04.239 music guy and i have to acknowledge all 00:03:05.680 my colleagues in the faculty arts and 00:03:06.879 thank you for initiating all this have 00:03:08.319 everybody coming up here uh for those of 00:03:10.000 you who are interested in the music that 00:03:10.879 i was playing uh while you were coming 00:03:12.319 into the room today uh that was a 00:03:13.519 wonderful composer singer bass player 00:03:15.440 named esperanza spalding i often 00:03:17.519 introduce her to crowds who don't know 00:03:18.480 her because one of her great 00:03:19.440 contributions to music is several years 00:03:21.200 ago she beat out justin bieber for best 00:03:23.120 new artist at the grammys so i thought 00:03:24.480 she deserves a shout out 00:03:28.959 i walk into many classrooms or watch 00:03:30.480 video recordings of many classrooms not 00:03:32.080 just in music in the sciences in the 00:03:33.840 humanities and i see students doing 00:03:35.920 things that bear only a faint 00:03:37.760 resemblance to what the discipline is 00:03:40.159 actually for 00:03:41.440 there's really not a focus on what the 00:03:42.959 thing that we're studying is really 00:03:44.560 about and i'll talk more about that as 00:03:46.239 we go along today but i just want to say 00:03:48.000 that these kinds of experiences the 00:03:49.680 experiences that start with a clear 00:03:51.680 focus about what is this for now when i 00:03:54.159 say what is this for i don't mean how do 00:03:55.599 you make money with it because i often 00:03:57.040 have students ask me or have my 00:03:58.480 colleagues tell me the student asked 00:03:59.519 them you know what am i ever going to 00:04:00.480 use this well 00:04:02.000 that's a that's a terrible rationale for 00:04:03.439 studying anything in college and often 00:04:04.720 when i have a student tell me i'm 00:04:05.599 wearing this thing when am i ever going 00:04:06.400 to use that i often have students did 00:04:07.519 you go to did you go to a movie last 00:04:08.879 week and often they say well yeah i did 00:04:10.000 i thought are you ever going to use that 00:04:11.439 right i mean you go to a movie because 00:04:12.799 there's something interesting about it 00:04:13.760 or or enlightening about it or at least 00:04:15.599 entertaining about it right 00:04:17.358 but when we think about how we plan 00:04:18.880 things in higher education and in 00:04:20.160 primary secondary education as well i 00:04:22.000 think a question that isn't asked often 00:04:23.520 enough or thought about clearly and 00:04:24.800 deeply enough is what is the thing that 00:04:26.880 we're trying to accomplish with the 00:04:28.400 people with whom we work whether they're 00:04:29.840 young children adults people in business 00:04:32.160 who are training employees whatever it 00:04:33.440 happens to be what is the thing that 00:04:34.800 we're actually trying to bring about in 00:04:35.919 the way that people think i mean 00:04:38.000 everyone knows if you look at curricula 00:04:39.840 in higher education or even in high 00:04:41.600 school secondary school primary primary 00:04:43.199 school almost all the courses are named 00:04:45.520 by the content of the course so this 00:04:47.680 course is about genetics this course is 00:04:50.000 about biological sciences this course is 00:04:51.680 about the history of music from 1750 to 00:04:53.440 the present day whatever the thing 00:04:54.400 happens to be but of course the goal 00:04:56.400 is much more than just conveying the 00:04:58.720 learners information about the content 00:05:01.120 that the course title describes i mean 00:05:03.520 what we're trying to do at texas now and 00:05:04.639 what i'm also trying to do at coburn is 00:05:06.080 acknowledge the fact that what education 00:05:08.160 is for is shaping thinking is teaching 00:05:10.720 people to think effectively and reason 00:05:12.400 effectively and communicate effectively 00:05:13.919 with other human beings right it's not 00:05:15.520 about the content and everyone in this 00:05:17.360 room who is an expert at anything knows 00:05:19.199 that your expertise is not the fact that 00:05:21.039 you know a lot of stuff now you do know 00:05:22.400 a lot of stuff 00:05:23.440 but the expertise comes from what you do 00:05:24.880 with the stuff you know right it's how 00:05:26.400 you use what you know to accomplish 00:05:28.000 things to solve problems to create new 00:05:29.600 things and that's the real purpose of 00:05:32.160 studying anything whatever it happens to 00:05:33.600 be it's not about the content again i'll 00:05:34.960 come to that again in just a few minutes 00:05:36.560 um we're all very fortunate to have this 00:05:38.400 three pounds of goo in our heads i don't 00:05:39.840 know if anybody can control the lights 00:05:40.960 in this room but if these front lights 00:05:42.080 could be a little dimmer i think people 00:05:43.120 are probably these slides a little 00:05:43.919 better um 00:05:45.520 this is uh 00:05:46.560 a typical human brain this is this is 00:05:47.840 not life-size by the way this is bigger 00:05:49.039 than uh 00:05:50.000 um but what's remarkable about this 00:05:51.919 thing most complicated machine in the 00:05:54.080 known universe upwards of a hundred 00:05:56.000 billion neurons in a typical human brain 00:05:57.600 and that doesn't count all the 00:05:58.800 astrocytes estrogen all the other 00:06:00.080 support cells that are in a typical 100 00:06:01.919 billion neurons that make upwards of 100 00:06:04.160 trillion connections with each other now 00:06:05.360 those are unimaginably large numbers as 00:06:07.120 our brains evolved we did not evolve to 00:06:08.800 deal with numbers that large i mean we 00:06:10.080 evolved to think that there's nothing 00:06:11.120 there there's something there there are 00:06:12.319 a couple things there there's a lot of 00:06:13.360 stuff there that's as sophisticated as 00:06:14.560 our intuitive number sense gets so the 00:06:16.160 idea of 100 billion neurons make 100 00:06:17.919 trillion connections not within our 00:06:19.520 scope of being able to think about in an 00:06:21.199 intuitive way but one thing's remarkable 00:06:22.960 about what brains do is they do two 00:06:24.240 things really well and one is they 00:06:25.919 recognize patterns in environmental 00:06:27.520 stimuli so as we kind of look around the 00:06:29.199 world right now we look around the room 00:06:30.800 we see patterns right our brains are 00:06:32.639 looking for patterns in fact our brains 00:06:33.919 are so good at finding patterns we find 00:06:35.360 patterns even when there are no patterns 00:06:36.880 right we can look at a cloud and say 00:06:38.160 look at that look at that antelope well 00:06:39.520 it's not an antelope it's a cloud so why 00:06:40.880 do we see an antelope there because our 00:06:41.919 brains are looking for ways to connect 00:06:43.199 that shape into something that we 00:06:44.560 already recognize and that brings up the 00:06:46.000 second thing that brains do really well 00:06:47.199 right is they form associations between 00:06:49.919 various stimuli and ideas that are 00:06:51.840 already in our head and those 00:06:53.199 associations we'd like to think are 00:06:54.800 always based on logical reasoning but 00:06:56.160 actually most of the associations are 00:06:57.120 based primarily on temporal proximity 00:06:59.840 that is things that happen near to each 00:07:01.199 other tend to become associated over 00:07:02.560 time and one of the important things to 00:07:03.919 think about for all of us who are 00:07:04.880 teachers and all of us who are learners 00:07:06.000 got other law students in here too is 00:07:07.680 how do we optimize the extent to which 00:07:09.840 we connect different ideas that we have 00:07:11.759 in our heads for a long time up the 00:07:13.440 middle of the last century actually the 00:07:14.800 prevailing wisdom in psychology the 00:07:16.240 brain sort of worked like recorders you 00:07:17.360 woke up the morning report the record 00:07:18.639 button goes on you experience things 00:07:20.160 gets written on the tape right you go to 00:07:21.520 sleep pause button goes on you want to 00:07:23.280 wake up the next day you want to 00:07:24.080 remember what happened two o'clock the 00:07:24.880 day before you rewind to take the two 00:07:25.919 o'clock play two o'clock there's two 00:07:26.880 o'clock today before that's a terrible 00:07:28.080 metaphor for organic brains for a lot of 00:07:30.240 reasons not the least of which is the 00:07:31.759 tape in your head isn't blank 00:07:33.520 there's stuff already in there and what 00:07:35.360 your brains are trying to do when you 00:07:36.240 experience something new is figure out 00:07:37.840 how does what's happening right now 00:07:39.440 relate to the stuff that's already in my 00:07:40.880 mind whether you're doing that 00:07:42.319 volitionally or just non-consciously 00:07:44.000 that's happening all the time so 00:07:45.440 everyone who's in this room right now is 00:07:47.039 experiencing this moment differently 00:07:49.120 from the person sitting next to you not 00:07:50.720 just because you're in a different place 00:07:52.160 and so you have a different visual 00:07:53.039 perspective and a different auditory 00:07:54.000 perspective but because you have 00:07:55.199 different experiences that you bring to 00:07:56.479 this moment and those experiences color 00:07:58.400 what's happening right now not only that 00:08:00.240 when all of you leave this room today 00:08:01.680 what happens to you after this 90 00:08:03.280 minutes is going to also affect what you 00:08:04.800 remember of right now so memory is not a 00:08:07.120 static thing when you're working on your 00:08:08.400 computer another metaphor that we often 00:08:09.759 use to think about organic memories and 00:08:11.680 you press the save command what your 00:08:13.120 computer does looks for a blank space on 00:08:14.240 the drive there with blank spaces again 00:08:16.000 writes what you just saved which means 00:08:17.520 binary switches flip from one to zero 00:08:18.960 zero to one in some configuration that 00:08:20.240 represents what you just intended to 00:08:21.360 save puts an address on it so the next 00:08:22.720 time you go to your computer and you 00:08:23.680 click on that address it'll go look for 00:08:25.199 that information it'll read off what you 00:08:26.960 saved the day before the week before the 00:08:28.160 month before and barring some 00:08:29.120 malfunction or disaster to your computer 00:08:31.440 what you wrote yesterday will be 00:08:32.719 precisely what you wrote before right if 00:08:35.360 you click on the icon today it'll be 00:08:36.399 just what you wrote yesterday or last 00:08:37.599 week or last month and what's on the 00:08:39.919 drive already when you save the new 00:08:41.519 thing has no effect on the new stuff 00:08:43.440 that you save and anything you save 00:08:45.200 subsequent to that thing that you saved 00:08:46.640 will have no effect on what you just 00:08:47.680 saved again borrowing some malfunction 00:08:49.200 now again organic frames don't work 00:08:50.560 anything like that memory is a 00:08:52.000 tremendously dynamic thing and we ignore 00:08:54.959 that at our apparel yet when you look at 00:08:56.800 most educational experiences that we 00:08:58.000 plan for learners again at every level 00:08:59.360 of expertise we tend to ignore the idea 00:09:01.600 that everyone is walking into the room 00:09:03.040 with a different set of experiences and 00:09:05.200 because of that we'll experience what 00:09:06.640 they're experiencing differently from 00:09:07.920 other people in the room and all of you 00:09:09.839 who have sat in a class which some of 00:09:11.120 you probably did today right know that 00:09:12.640 the experiences you're having are 00:09:13.600 different from your classmates those of 00:09:14.720 you who have taught a class wonder with 00:09:16.320 some mystery why that one student seems 00:09:18.080 so fascinated by what you're doing and 00:09:19.360 another student seems to be such a 00:09:20.480 miscreant we can't get him to put this 00:09:22.000 newspaper down now that may be based on 00:09:24.320 some you know inherent flaws or 00:09:25.920 advantages that some people have but i 00:09:27.440 would argue that much of it has to do 00:09:28.399 with the fact that we teach in a way 00:09:30.399 that presumes that all learners come 00:09:32.399 into the room relatively similarly 00:09:34.480 and then all of them learn in similar 00:09:36.240 ways and at similar rates and that we 00:09:38.560 when we evaluate them they'll all learn 00:09:40.000 at the right time and that when they 00:09:41.839 leave the room they're going to retain 00:09:42.800 pretty much what we imparted to them all 00:09:44.720 of which is demonstrably untrue uh and i 00:09:47.040 want to talk about that a little bit now 00:09:48.240 in more detail i mean obviously as we're 00:09:50.240 sort of walking around the world and 00:09:51.200 experiencing things that we experience 00:09:52.880 all that stuff in the natural world has 00:09:54.640 to be encoded in some way that it can be 00:09:56.320 stored in this electrochemical mass of 00:09:58.640 cells right so there's some encoding 00:10:00.160 process that has to take place we hope 00:10:01.920 that what gets in there is going to stay 00:10:03.519 in there over a long period of time but 00:10:05.040 i invite you to think about the fact 00:10:06.480 that we forget most of what we 00:10:08.399 experience 00:10:09.440 the current wisdom and psychology 00:10:10.880 suggests that what we consider the 00:10:11.839 psychological present what i mean by 00:10:13.200 that is like what now is for us is a 00:10:15.360 window of about three seconds in 00:10:16.480 duration so now lasts about three 00:10:18.240 seconds and now that now becomes then 00:10:19.920 and there's a new now and it happens so 00:10:21.440 in a typical waking day not of an 00:10:23.120 undergraduate because i know you guys 00:10:23.920 don't sleep but in a typical waking day 00:10:26.000 uh a a an an adult who gets a full night 00:10:28.320 of sleep will experience 20 000 now 00:10:30.959 most of which are completely forgotten 00:10:33.200 and you have to think that's probably a 00:10:34.399 good thing as i was walking from my 00:10:36.000 hotel over to campus today i could not 00:10:37.839 possibly recount the people that i 00:10:39.440 passed or describe most of the buildings 00:10:41.519 that i walked past i can't even remember 00:10:42.720 the street names right now part of that 00:10:43.920 has to do with my storage capacity as an 00:10:45.200 aging adult is diminishing but that's 00:10:46.320 another story 00:10:47.519 but there's no advantage to my 00:10:48.720 remembering those things right so you 00:10:50.560 have to ask the question as a teacher as 00:10:52.000 a learner what would motivate my brain 00:10:54.240 to expend the biological energy to 00:10:56.240 actually form a memory 00:10:57.920 i tell you what won't do that what 00:10:59.600 you're doing right now 00:11:01.680 i promise you there's a little truth in 00:11:02.720 advertising here i'm sorry patrick to 00:11:03.760 say this right right up front none of 00:11:04.880 you is going to learn anything from me 00:11:06.000 today at least not while you're in this 00:11:07.600 room and the reason is right now none of 00:11:09.760 you is busy enough to be learning 00:11:11.440 anything now what's interesting this is 00:11:13.680 considered a learning environment in 00:11:14.880 many institutions 00:11:16.399 in fact at texas we have lecture halls 00:11:18.160 just like this and we're so committed to 00:11:19.440 the idea we bolt the chairs to the floor 00:11:23.200 right but i have to tell you this is 00:11:24.560 this is a lousy learning environment 00:11:26.399 right because basically it presumes that 00:11:28.480 the way you're going to learn is by 00:11:30.079 watching what i do and listening to what 00:11:31.600 i say and look at the stuff that i put 00:11:33.040 up on this on the screen 00:11:34.720 what a ridiculous idea i mean given the 00:11:37.040 evidence that we have that that's not 00:11:38.000 the case right now that brings me to my 00:11:40.480 next thing which is why i ask you to sit 00:11:42.000 next to somebody that you've not yet met 00:11:43.040 i'm gonna ask you to do a task that for 00:11:44.160 me so if you have something to write 00:11:44.959 with would you take out something to 00:11:45.839 write with and if you're generous and 00:11:46.959 someone sitting next to you who looks 00:11:47.839 sort of confused give them something to 00:11:49.200 write with 00:11:52.240 okay i have a brief task for you now 00:11:56.560 by the way all of you sharing your 00:11:57.760 materials thank you very much 00:12:02.560 i assume all of you who are 00:12:03.440 undergraduates who are majoring in 00:12:04.480 something 00:12:06.000 and of course all of your faculty have 00:12:07.360 majored in something and have things 00:12:08.399 that you've committed your lives to what 00:12:09.680 i'd like you to do is take three minutes 00:12:11.600 and write down what you think to be the 00:12:13.279 three most interesting and far-reaching 00:12:15.680 ideas in your discipline 00:12:18.079 the three most interesting and 00:12:19.680 far-reaching ideas in your discipline 00:12:22.240 right three minutes and i'll come back 00:12:23.600 and get you in a minute 00:12:25.839 now i'd like you to take the most 00:12:27.120 interesting of those three ideas 00:12:29.279 and in about three minutes explain it to 00:12:31.360 the person sitting next to you 00:12:33.040 and if you're the person on the 00:12:34.480 listening end of the first part of this 00:12:35.600 conversation your task is to ask at 00:12:37.760 least two penetrating questions of the 00:12:39.440 person who's explaining this to you 00:12:41.120 right and then after about five minutes 00:12:43.519 i'm gonna ask you to switch and the 00:12:45.360 listener becomes the speaker and the 00:12:46.560 speaker becomes a listener and the other 00:12:48.160 person has the responsibility of asking 00:12:49.440 a couple of penetrating questions okay 00:12:50.880 so uh so i don't have to scream when 00:12:52.480 it's time to stop when it's time to 00:12:53.760 switch i'll stand up on the stage and 00:12:55.200 when it's time to stop i'll stay up on 00:12:56.160 the stage again so right now get to work 00:12:59.600 thank you i want to tell you what just 00:13:01.680 happened is the best thing will happen 00:13:02.720 this whole talk 00:13:05.519 and that should happen every day in 00:13:07.600 every class and all of you who are 00:13:09.360 explaining your ideas even ideas that 00:13:11.200 you think you know and understand really 00:13:12.560 well i would suggest have them modified 00:13:14.560 slightly by having to explain them to 00:13:15.839 somebody else not just because you want 00:13:16.959 to say them out loud not because you had 00:13:17.839 to put them into words but because 00:13:19.200 another person is looking at you and 00:13:21.040 looking like they're confused or they 00:13:22.639 get it or they want more or stop talking 00:13:25.040 to me or whatever their expression 00:13:26.000 happens to be and all of that is 00:13:28.000 influencing how you're interpreting the 00:13:29.360 information that you have in your head 00:13:30.720 now 00:13:31.680 we think that we do this all the time i 00:13:33.120 mean those of us in the hallowed halls 00:13:35.120 of academy you know we go to meetings 00:13:36.480 and we talk to people and we have these 00:13:37.440 conversations all the time but actually 00:13:39.120 this kind of conversational aspect of 00:13:41.040 learning and thinking has to be 00:13:42.720 practiced right i mean some of you are 00:13:44.240 better at this than others some of you 00:13:45.120 thought you know i've been sitting in 00:13:46.320 this class now i've been this major i've 00:13:47.360 taken four classes in this i've never 00:13:48.720 tried to explain this to another person 00:13:50.000 before i've just answered things on a 00:13:51.519 test 00:13:52.720 now 00:13:53.600 why is that 00:13:54.720 i mean not because there aren't 00:13:55.680 opportunities or opportunities are 00:13:56.800 different but again it gets back to the 00:13:58.560 idea that the notion is that i know 00:14:00.240 stuff you don't know stuff you're going 00:14:01.920 to come into my class i'm going to tell 00:14:03.199 you stuff then you'll know it then i'll 00:14:04.639 ask you what i told you you'll tell it 00:14:05.680 to me to prove that you know it and then 00:14:07.040 i'll give you an email walk out of the 00:14:08.079 room right except that's a terrible 00:14:10.480 model for learning because actually if 00:14:13.199 we have people experience anything new 00:14:14.959 whatever the discipline happens to be 00:14:16.480 and what we ask them to do is only the 00:14:17.920 things that we've explicitly shown them 00:14:19.120 how to do 00:14:20.160 it's possible for people to do something 00:14:21.519 that gives the appearance that they 00:14:22.800 understand when they actually understand 00:14:24.079 or understand anything 00:14:25.360 i mean one of i mean all of you who are 00:14:26.800 good students in this room by whatever 00:14:28.160 you know your parents or maybe calls a 00:14:29.199 good student know that one of the 00:14:30.959 hallmarks of being a good student is 00:14:32.560 compliance 00:14:34.399 right is following instructions and 00:14:36.079 making sure you listen carefully and 00:14:37.519 write down exactly what was said and 00:14:39.040 remember it 00:14:40.240 right but i'd like to suggest that well 00:14:42.320 that's that's certainly you know not a 00:14:44.000 bad thing but if you really want to 00:14:46.240 understand something and if a teacher or 00:14:48.000 a faculty wants you to understand 00:14:49.279 something then we're never really going 00:14:51.040 to know the extent to which you 00:14:51.839 understand it until we ask you to do 00:14:53.199 things that we've not explicitly shown 00:14:54.399 you how to do and that's what i want to 00:14:56.079 talk about next so we talked about 00:14:57.680 encoding storage the retrieval part of 00:14:59.920 course all of us have learned lots of 00:15:01.120 stuff at least we thought we learned and 00:15:02.959 now we can't recall it at all right 00:15:05.120 because we learned it in a very specific 00:15:06.560 context that had very specific cues and 00:15:08.720 all those cues are now gone and you know 00:15:10.320 one of the best day-to-day examples of 00:15:12.000 this whenever you see somebody that you 00:15:13.279 know i mean you don't know them well but 00:15:14.399 you know them enough to know their name 00:15:15.760 and then you encounter them in an 00:15:17.279 environment where you don't usually 00:15:18.560 encounter them you're in another city 00:15:20.240 and you see somebody you and their name 00:15:22.000 escapes you 00:15:23.120 why is that because their name is bound 00:15:25.040 to the context in which you experience 00:15:26.560 them most of the times when you 00:15:27.600 experience them and now the context is 00:15:28.800 different so now the memory is different 00:15:31.600 so if you think about what we're doing 00:15:32.720 when we're trying to learn something new 00:15:34.320 and we're learning to think better or 00:15:35.680 more effectively or whatever it happens 00:15:36.800 to be 00:15:37.760 context matters so how do we create 00:15:39.920 experiences so the retrieval likelihood 00:15:42.079 is increased and it has to do with what 00:15:44.240 kinds of experiences people have at the 00:15:45.600 time of encoding 00:15:47.040 uh often in the past couple years i've 00:15:48.240 been speaking to medical school faculty 00:15:49.680 and medical medical schools in the u.s 00:15:51.279 are some of the best worst examples of 00:15:53.759 non-interactive learning right you go to 00:15:55.759 your virology lecture and you have your 00:15:56.880 big biology book and you read about your 00:15:58.079 book or you go to violence or worse you 00:15:59.360 don't go to the variety lecture you just 00:16:00.560 watch the video online and you memorize 00:16:02.639 all that stuff so when you take your 00:16:03.600 boards you pass the biology thing and we 00:16:05.279 jam all this virology into your head 00:16:06.560 during your biology semester with a 00:16:07.759 thought in mind that when you're on in 00:16:09.279 your residency and you're on rounds and 00:16:10.560 a patient presents with a certain 00:16:11.839 combination of symptoms you know back in 00:16:13.279 your mind pull out your virology stuff 00:16:15.040 and bring it together to make some 00:16:16.560 diagnosis this patient brains don't work 00:16:18.320 anything like that 00:16:19.759 so you have to ask the question when 00:16:21.040 we're trying to put stuff in whether 00:16:22.480 it's into our own mind or somebody 00:16:23.519 else's mind right how many opportunities 00:16:25.519 are we providing for people to practice 00:16:27.519 getting it out 00:16:28.959 and i'll say it again or putting enough 00:16:30.320 putting it in how many opportunities 00:16:31.600 you're trying to people practice getting 00:16:32.720 it out 00:16:33.920 because we know now let me show you a 00:16:35.360 beautiful photograph now you know in 00:16:37.279 biology you know we know about the 00:16:38.240 genome and the biome and the proteome 00:16:39.920 and now in in neuroscience neuroscience 00:16:41.759 felt like it was getting shaded so 00:16:42.800 generous times a connectome and what 00:16:44.240 this beautiful photograph is is uh 00:16:46.480 neuronal pathways of axons that was 00:16:48.560 recorded with diffusion tension tensor 00:16:50.240 imaging which shows how axons connect 00:16:52.240 different parts of the brain to one 00:16:53.759 another which is a fascinating thing 00:16:54.800 because all this stuff is operating in 00:16:57.199 different parts of the brain that are 00:16:58.880 highly interconnected and actually 00:17:01.120 memories are distributed widely through 00:17:03.279 parts of the brain right a memory 00:17:04.799 doesn't live in one place every memory 00:17:06.480 that we have perhaps has a visual 00:17:08.079 component it has an auditory component 00:17:09.280 it may have a tactile component it may 00:17:10.480 have some other connections to some 00:17:11.839 other aspects of experiences or our 00:17:13.439 memories and all of that 00:17:15.439 this distribution needs to be 00:17:16.640 reconnected each time we recall a memory 00:17:19.199 so retrieving what we know requires as 00:17:21.359 much practice 00:17:22.559 as rehearsing what we know in a very 00:17:24.400 specific way and the more varied those 00:17:26.880 practice opportunities are the greater 00:17:28.480 the likelihood that the things that we 00:17:29.840 learn will be advantageously retrievable 00:17:31.440 at some point uh in the future 00:17:33.679 um 00:17:34.799 i i have the privilege of working at one 00:17:36.400 of the largest research universities on 00:17:37.919 the planet earth and not only that we 00:17:39.679 have one hell of a football team and uh 00:17:41.679 at least in some years we do but uh 00:17:43.840 a as you probably know if you watch uh 00:17:46.000 ncaa sports on television uh all 00:17:48.480 universities have little 10-second 00:17:50.480 snippets of advertising to tout how cool 00:17:52.799 the university is and how much everybody 00:17:54.000 should want to go to school there and 00:17:55.280 i'm going to show you one that i pulled 00:17:56.640 off the web uh about 10 years ago 00:17:58.160 unfortunately we don't show it more but 00:17:59.600 uh you'll appreciate it when i when i 00:18:01.760 show to you you can probably tell from 00:18:02.799 my accent i'm not from texas uh but i've 00:18:04.960 been there for very long time and i've 00:18:06.080 grown very fond of the place it has a 00:18:07.760 lovely oddness to it that's really 00:18:09.200 attractive um and i don't say anything 00:18:10.880 else about this ad i'm just going to 00:18:11.760 show you the ad and we'll talk about why 00:18:13.520 i love texas after you see this end 00:18:20.480 we don't claim to be able to change the 00:18:22.400 world 00:18:25.919 we just change people 00:18:29.760 and then they change the world 00:18:37.679 we're texas 00:18:40.240 we got steel guitar walter cronkite you 00:18:42.080 know breakfast tacos is fantastic uh 00:18:44.559 now i i just love the audacity of that 00:18:46.320 ad you know we just change people they 00:18:48.000 come here we just change them and they 00:18:49.280 gotta change the world now what this was 00:18:50.960 playing whenever i find myself in some 00:18:52.160 social gathering with the then president 00:18:53.200 and then provost i said you know that ad 00:18:54.240 we're playing now but we just change 00:18:55.200 people how do we know that 00:18:57.919 and how do we know we're changing the 00:18:58.960 way we're intending to change them and 00:19:00.400 of course the honest answer those both 00:19:01.360 those questions is we don't have any 00:19:02.240 idea right we bring into rooms like this 00:19:04.240 and we do stuff at them and then 00:19:05.679 everyone's trying to ask you to do stuff 00:19:06.960 and we let you leave assuming that we've 00:19:08.720 changed you and you've been changing 00:19:09.760 some fundamental way right all evidence 00:19:11.760 to the contrary sometimes so 00:19:13.840 if you're going to change somebody 00:19:15.600 they got to be a lot busier than you are 00:19:17.600 right now 00:19:18.799 right right now listening is seen to be 00:19:21.679 a learning activity listening is just 00:19:23.760 listening 00:19:24.720 if any of you learns anything from my 00:19:26.320 talk today the learning will start when 00:19:28.480 you're outside of this room and either 00:19:30.240 you recall something or something comes 00:19:31.440 up in a discussion and you start to talk 00:19:32.960 about it with somebody else or you start 00:19:34.000 to think well what would i do with a 00:19:35.120 syllabus given what i and you started 00:19:37.039 that's when the learning will start this 00:19:38.320 isn't the learning part 00:19:39.840 and typically because we're well 00:19:41.120 intended as teachers what we want to do 00:19:43.200 is set people up so carefully that when 00:19:45.200 they actually start doing something 00:19:46.480 we've gotten them ready to do it 00:19:48.640 thinking that the more ready-getting we 00:19:50.559 do the better they'll do it when they 00:19:52.160 actually when we actually give them a 00:19:53.039 chance to try and what i'd like to 00:19:54.640 suggest to you is just the opposite is 00:19:56.080 true that all the getting ready stuff is 00:19:58.720 missing one important feature of 00:20:00.240 learning and that is a learner's 00:20:02.160 generating activity 00:20:03.760 from which they gain 00:20:05.360 information from their own behavior 00:20:07.760 now we like to think and anyone who's 00:20:09.039 raised children thinks this all the time 00:20:10.720 i i want to protect my children from 00:20:12.320 hurt you know i don't i don't want them 00:20:14.080 to experience a sad moment in life right 00:20:16.000 i want to set them up and when our 00:20:17.120 daughter was dating it was the worst 00:20:18.480 period of my life 00:20:20.240 but but through all that time right i 00:20:21.919 think if i just set them up carefully 00:20:23.280 enough nothing will go wrong 00:20:25.600 and what i want to leave you with today 00:20:26.559 is one of my main points if nothing goes 00:20:28.400 wrong 00:20:29.200 it's unlikely you're going to learn 00:20:30.159 anything 00:20:31.520 that the nature of learning 00:20:33.440 is confronting dissonances between what 00:20:35.200 you either expect to have happen or what 00:20:36.400 you'd like to have happen and the 00:20:37.520 reality that you confront and resolving 00:20:39.760 those dissonances is what motivates a 00:20:41.520 brain to expend its biological energy to 00:20:43.120 actually form a memory or refine memory 00:20:45.840 so learning requires much more doing on 00:20:47.760 the part of the learner which is not a 00:20:48.960 new idea except typically the way we 00:20:51.520 characterize learning on the part of a 00:20:52.880 learner is having somebody go away and 00:20:54.320 write a paper or take a test or do a lab 00:20:56.960 experiment or those kinds of kinds of 00:20:58.480 things but if we set people up carefully 00:21:00.320 enough right we unfortunately set them 00:21:02.880 up in a way that the student especially 00:21:04.320 a good student learns i'm going to do 00:21:05.919 this without making many mistakes 00:21:08.640 i mean any of us who've ever supervised 00:21:09.919 a doctoral student knows the frustration 00:21:11.600 when the doctor is trying to work on 00:21:12.720 their dissertation looking to us like we 00:21:14.960 already know what's supposed to happen 00:21:16.000 if we just tell them they would just do 00:21:17.360 it right and to finally realize i don't 00:21:20.240 know how to do your dissertation if i 00:21:21.679 knew how to do it it wouldn't be worth a 00:21:22.960 dissertation right because then somebody 00:21:24.799 already figured it out right you're 00:21:25.919 trying to figure out i'm trying to 00:21:26.720 figure it out and that lack of direction 00:21:29.200 many students see as highly frustrating 00:21:31.200 and why would they not because all 00:21:32.960 through school i am the confusion 00:21:34.799 eliminator 00:21:36.000 right if i see a student who looks 00:21:37.360 confused and they have this look at my 00:21:38.400 face like oh look at this i mean i'm a 00:21:40.240 nice human being i want to come 00:21:41.440 unconfuse you that's my tendency so let 00:21:43.280 me explain it to you and think about 00:21:44.240 i've explained it to you now you're 00:21:45.120 smiling at me and i'm happy because 00:21:46.240 you're happy with me and now i think you 00:21:47.360 understand this except the only problem 00:21:48.720 is you didn't learn anything 00:21:50.480 right best comment i ever heard from one 00:21:51.760 of my former graduate students she was 00:21:53.039 teaching a piano class for non-majors 00:21:54.799 that was full of football players which 00:21:55.760 is fantastic and she was is this little 00:21:57.360 woman from from north carolina she's 00:21:58.720 just like this tall and so when she was 00:22:00.240 standing next to a piano and one of her 00:22:01.840 classes one of her students was sitting 00:22:03.039 at the piano they were at eye level you 00:22:04.080 know so so she's watching this guy try 00:22:05.760 to work out a finger into some little 00:22:06.880 naughty passage you know and so after 00:22:08.720 club is a great frustration she looks at 00:22:10.159 my students and says you know if you 00:22:11.039 were a good teacher you'd show me how to 00:22:12.159 do this and my student said yes i know 00:22:14.159 but because i'm an excellent teacher i'm 00:22:15.520 going to wait a few minutes while you 00:22:16.400 figure it out 00:22:17.679 now i thought that's astute right now 00:22:20.159 she said that 00:22:21.440 with the informed confidence that 00:22:22.880 actually he could figure it out 00:22:24.799 right just throw people into the weeds 00:22:26.400 and say good luck it'll be good for you 00:22:27.760 that's just mean right but 00:22:30.080 but the idea that most learners have in 00:22:32.000 school is confusion is something to be 00:22:33.840 avoided 00:22:35.280 right and the reason i go to school is 00:22:36.960 to eliminate my confusions 00:22:38.960 but all of us who work at research 00:22:40.799 institutions know 00:22:42.080 you know the government pays this 00:22:43.039 exorbitant salaries to be confused most 00:22:44.559 of the time 00:22:45.840 right i mean that's why we do what we're 00:22:47.760 doing because it's confusing and i don't 00:22:49.120 know the answer and that confusion is 00:22:50.640 not something to be avoided that's how i 00:22:52.240 figure out the answer is by working 00:22:54.080 through my confusions but if i as a 00:22:56.000 teacher i'm a person who's actually 00:22:57.520 working through your confusions with you 00:22:59.280 or for you you have an entirely 00:23:00.799 different experience in the room now if 00:23:03.039 if i had four hours to talk today 00:23:04.480 instead of just an hour and a half 00:23:06.480 i would say a lot about how wedded this 00:23:08.159 is to the idea of how we evaluate 00:23:10.080 students progress in a class right 00:23:12.240 because being asked to do things that 00:23:13.280 you've not explicitly shown been shown 00:23:14.960 how to do is understandably daunting 00:23:17.120 right because usually in a class if you 00:23:18.480 understand how to do something your 00:23:19.600 grades going down 00:23:21.280 and instead 00:23:22.400 to be in a place where it's valued to 00:23:24.559 not quite understand this but being able 00:23:26.480 to have strategies that allow you to 00:23:27.679 work through it even if you don't get to 00:23:29.200 the right answer but you have some 00:23:30.320 things that you know how to do to point 00:23:32.080 you toward the right answer that's a 00:23:33.440 different kind of assessment which again 00:23:34.640 i want to talk about we'll get to that 00:23:35.679 just a minute um 00:23:37.360 this is my favorite phrase i ever made 00:23:38.960 up uh i i think every learning 00:23:41.600 experience whether you're a teacher 00:23:42.720 planning a class or an institution 00:23:44.320 planning a curriculum or a degree should 00:23:46.080 start with that with a clear vivid 00:23:48.720 crystalline image of students as 00:23:50.720 accomplished learners and by that i mean 00:23:52.720 when we're finished with students and 00:23:54.559 they're finished with us what do we want 00:23:56.240 them to be like 00:23:57.760 now i choose my verbs very carefully i 00:23:59.520 i'm not using the lingo of curriculum it 00:24:01.200 says what do we want them to know and be 00:24:02.159 able to do what do we want them to be 00:24:03.679 like 00:24:04.720 because no one be able to do ignores 00:24:06.320 that there's an attitudinal component to 00:24:07.600 being successful in a discipline 00:24:09.520 right i mean if i want to be a bench 00:24:10.960 scientist and every time i set up an 00:24:12.240 experiment it doesn't work i want to 00:24:13.200 start throwing equipment across the room 00:24:14.400 i'm not going to be a very successful 00:24:15.360 bench scientist because most experiments 00:24:16.799 don't work now for many students that is 00:24:19.840 a bizarre thing to recognize because 00:24:22.159 when they were in biology lab they only 00:24:24.000 got credit if the experiment worked 00:24:26.640 right i mean we have labs all over our 00:24:28.559 campus where students come in they're 00:24:30.000 freshman biology majors or chemistry 00:24:31.360 majors or whatever and you do this thing 00:24:33.360 and if it doesn't come out right you 00:24:34.400 don't get credit now how is that an 00:24:35.520 experiment you know it's like a cake 00:24:37.200 recipe you know water water didn't turn 00:24:39.039 blue only half credit for chemistry 00:24:40.480 right i mean that's not why any of us 00:24:42.159 who do research do research right it's 00:24:43.840 because we don't know how it's going to 00:24:44.960 come out and part of being successful in 00:24:48.159 conducting inquiry like that is having 00:24:50.320 an attitude that allows you to deal with 00:24:52.240 the ambiguity and uncertainty of not 00:24:54.559 necessarily knowing what the right 00:24:55.600 answer is right but unfortunately we 00:24:57.840 inadvertently but very systematically 00:24:59.360 and often very successfully teach 00:25:01.120 students that not knowing what the 00:25:02.080 answer is is something to escape and 00:25:03.679 avoid at every opportunity so i just 00:25:06.400 wrote down adjectives that describe my 00:25:07.679 favorite students i would love rooms 00:25:08.720 full of people like this but i reject 00:25:09.919 out of hand the notion that babies come 00:25:11.200 from the factory like that right i mean 00:25:13.200 people learn to be 00:25:14.480 attentive 00:25:16.000 or they don't 00:25:17.360 and they learn to be meticulous about 00:25:18.720 the way they think or they don't 00:25:20.960 and they learn to be thoughtful not just 00:25:22.240 consider it thoughtful but thinking 00:25:23.279 thoughtful or they don't and the extent 00:25:24.640 to which any individual any of us in 00:25:26.159 this room and including all of us in 00:25:27.200 this room exhibits any of those 00:25:28.480 behaviors 00:25:29.600 varies depending on the environment in 00:25:30.960 which we find ourselves 00:25:32.400 right i mean there's some places we go 00:25:33.600 and we are 00:25:34.799 just really into it and focused and 00:25:36.720 listening hard 00:25:38.240 and other places it's really hard to 00:25:39.600 stay awake so it can't just be something 00:25:42.000 inherent in us 00:25:43.520 right there have to be things about the 00:25:44.880 environments that make it easier or 00:25:46.480 harder to demonstrate any one of those 00:25:48.320 charac one of those characteristics and 00:25:49.919 if you made up a list you'd probably 00:25:51.039 have your own set of characteristics and 00:25:52.159 not mine 00:25:53.200 but one thing i want to talk about from 00:25:54.320 the beginning is how do we make this 00:25:55.840 happen in a classroom right how do we 00:25:57.679 set this up in such a way that classes 00:25:59.520 facilitate the kinds of thinking and 00:26:01.200 puzzling and muddling that i'm talking 00:26:02.559 about 00:26:03.600 and you know when i first went to texas 00:26:05.919 i was i was asked to be on some 00:26:06.960 committee 00:26:07.919 for the state that was trying to plan 00:26:09.600 how they were going to evaluate primary 00:26:10.799 and secondary school teachers in texas 00:26:11.919 and i know anything about texas i just 00:26:12.880 got to text up a nice way to meet people 00:26:14.240 but it was one of these ridiculous 00:26:15.279 governmental committees that like 30 00:26:16.480 people on it is nowhere to get anything 00:26:17.440 done just ridiculous you know and uh so 00:26:19.679 we're talking about what what to do and 00:26:20.799 again i was obviously from out of state 00:26:22.640 and uh i said well you know it's like 00:26:24.640 1985 or 86. i said you know there are a 00:26:26.880 bunch of states united states have 00:26:27.840 actually kind of tackled this problem 00:26:28.799 before maybe we should get their 00:26:30.080 documents and look at them as a starting 00:26:31.440 place for our document in texas not 00:26:32.799 forgetting where i just moved 00:26:34.559 and uh after i suggested that it was a 00:26:36.080 long pause whenever we looked at the 00:26:37.039 floor a lot and the chair of the 00:26:38.080 committee looked at me and said 00:26:39.840 other states 00:26:41.919 like you know why would we consult that 00:26:43.279 so anyway i i i prevailed upon them to 00:26:45.840 allow me to do this and i and i looked 00:26:47.600 at all these evaluation systems of 00:26:48.960 evaluating teaching and what struck me 00:26:50.320 was how alike they all are which 00:26:51.520 shouldn't have been so surprising and 00:26:52.720 basically when teachers are evaluated 00:26:53.919 probably on the on the master campus too 00:26:55.919 that's the stuff that gets evaluated now 00:26:56.880 the language might be different or the 00:26:57.840 configuration but basically when you 00:26:58.799 evaluate teaching that's what that that 00:27:00.320 what what what you evaluate now of those 00:27:02.480 six things that are up there which thing 00:27:03.679 do you think is the least attention when 00:27:05.440 teachers are evaluated what do you think 00:27:06.799 gets the least attention i won't make 00:27:08.720 you guys out of it it's the first one 00:27:11.679 right now a lot of people think learning 00:27:12.880 environment no not instagram yourself 00:27:14.960 you have a degree in math okay check now 00:27:16.159 let's go look at your learning 00:27:16.720 environment now i want to do something 00:27:18.320 undergraduates a little truth in 00:27:19.279 advertising here it's possible to go 00:27:21.200 through a fine institution like mcmaster 00:27:23.279 pass all your classes you can make very 00:27:24.720 good grades maybe even have gold cords 00:27:26.320 around your regalia when you walk across 00:27:27.440 the stage 00:27:28.400 and not really understand your subject 00:27:29.440 matter very deeply 00:27:31.039 right now 00:27:32.480 that's worth thinking about not just in 00:27:34.080 terms of your own education but thinking 00:27:36.400 about what kinds of experiences are 00:27:37.679 required for me to actually know where 00:27:40.320 the gaps are in my own understanding 00:27:42.240 right and that's the task and this is 00:27:43.600 making the understanding so what i mean 00:27:44.960 by knowledge matter first of all is is 00:27:46.960 understanding the discipline from 00:27:47.919 outside your expertise so i was asking 00:27:49.120 you to talk to one another about things 00:27:50.320 that are interesting and important about 00:27:51.120 your subject matter practicing doing 00:27:52.480 that changes the way you think about 00:27:54.320 what's important about your discipline 00:27:55.440 what always strikes me when i ask 00:27:56.799 audiences like this to write down the 00:27:58.159 three most important and far-reaching 00:27:59.520 aspects of this one is how many people 00:28:00.960 don't have them at the ready 00:28:02.799 because my thought is what are you 00:28:03.840 thinking about then 00:28:05.039 right well i got this little trivial 00:28:06.559 thing that i've been spending time on 00:28:07.360 this completely disconnected from the 00:28:08.240 main idea because everybody who's an 00:28:09.440 expert at everything in this room knows 00:28:11.200 the more you learn about a discipline 00:28:12.399 the more you realize that this one's 00:28:13.440 really based on a very small number of 00:28:14.640 very fundamental ideas right now as a 00:28:17.279 novice you see a new discipline and you 00:28:18.559 see this morass of data you think my god 00:28:20.799 how can i possibly remember all that 00:28:22.240 stuff and you watch a really learned 00:28:24.000 person a discipline give a lecture with 00:28:25.200 no notes and they're calling references 00:28:26.480 out of the air and think my god how 00:28:27.760 could you remember that i couldn't 00:28:28.720 possibly remember that and the answer to 00:28:30.399 that is you're right you couldn't 00:28:31.200 possibly remember that but it has 00:28:32.640 nothing to do with the inherent 00:28:33.440 limitations of your memory store the 00:28:35.120 reason that person can remember all that 00:28:36.480 stuff and you seemingly can't is because 00:28:38.399 that person's information is organized 00:28:40.399 in memory entirely different from yours 00:28:42.799 and that organization is based on very 00:28:44.960 fundamental ideas that permeate the 00:28:47.600 discipline whatever this one happens to 00:28:48.799 be so 00:28:50.720 if you think about what you're teaching 00:28:51.600 in a class and what you're learning in a 00:28:52.799 class is everything really focused on 00:28:54.640 the fundamental structure of the subject 00:28:56.159 and what i mean by the first thing broad 00:28:57.840 underlying persons are intellectually 00:28:58.880 interesting i think that speaks for 00:28:59.679 itself intellectually introducing and 00:29:01.600 functionally valuable and my 00:29:02.399 functionality i don't think you can make 00:29:03.440 money with it necessarily i mean you can 00:29:04.799 think with it 00:29:06.080 right to know 00:29:08.080 the date that rousseau died 00:29:10.399 could be an interesting date or it could 00:29:12.320 be absolutely trivial depending on what 00:29:14.080 it's connected to 00:29:15.440 now if the only thing i ask you as your 00:29:17.039 teacher is to tell me the date and 00:29:18.960 that's as far as you can go with it why 00:29:20.320 would i expect you to think that's at 00:29:21.440 all interesting 00:29:22.960 right and often that's what happens when 00:29:24.720 we evaluate learners right we don't go 00:29:26.480 all the way to the application of the 00:29:27.840 thing that we're learning the part that 00:29:28.960 actually makes what you're learning 00:29:30.000 interesting and meaningful we just go up 00:29:31.679 to the starting point with the idea in 00:29:32.799 mind let's just get the dates in your 00:29:34.240 memory and then in a couple years we'll 00:29:36.080 pull those out 00:29:37.279 right and see how they connect to the 00:29:39.039 culture in europe during that time well 00:29:40.559 you know what a couple years from now 00:29:41.600 that's going to be gone 00:29:43.360 and it's gone because it's disconnected 00:29:44.960 to the other things that are already in 00:29:45.919 your head okay um 00:29:48.240 you know i i see some people in the 00:29:50.080 audience are my age and 00:29:51.919 younger uh but people were my age or my 00:29:53.760 contemporaries here you might remember 00:29:54.960 when we were first introduced to desktop 00:29:56.960 computing 00:29:57.919 uh and how cool that was you know in in 00:30:00.240 the in the late 70s early 80s that you 00:30:02.000 could actually have a computer on your 00:30:04.240 desk i mean it was just so cool you know 00:30:06.320 and i remember getting my first computer 00:30:07.600 was in the box somebody delivered to my 00:30:08.640 desk 00:30:09.520 in my office and i opened it up i was so 00:30:10.880 excited you know and i pulled out the 00:30:12.080 manual for the thing which is like that 00:30:13.679 thick you know 00:30:14.880 and i turn the manual and it says 00:30:16.320 setting up your computer and it says 00:30:17.919 step one boot the 00:30:20.840 system it's 00:30:22.640 it's in the box you know 00:30:24.640 right now now what what well-intentioned 00:30:27.279 human being would write as step one 00:30:30.240 boot the system 00:30:31.520 well i tell you who somebody for whom 00:30:33.440 booting the system is his first 00:30:35.120 conscious thought when he works on his 00:30:36.720 computer 00:30:37.840 and of course the cpu needs to be 00:30:39.520 plugged into the monitor and of course 00:30:41.279 the floppy disk goes in with the notch 00:30:42.640 on the right and of course it's supposed 00:30:43.840 to be making that sound when you close 00:30:45.200 the little thing 00:30:46.159 unless you don't know any of that right 00:30:48.080 and then this is just mysterious 00:30:50.480 right now if you ask yourself the 00:30:52.080 question right whatever the subject 00:30:53.120 matter happens to be what does somebody 00:30:54.480 actually need to know and do to 00:30:56.880 understand what's really important about 00:30:58.080 the subject matter often we think well 00:31:00.000 i've got to get them through all this 00:31:00.960 preliminary stuff first and then we'll 00:31:03.039 get to the interesting stuff and the 00:31:04.399 person who wrote the booth the system 00:31:05.520 thing probably thought let's just get 00:31:06.640 right to it 00:31:07.760 except i don't i don't know that the 00:31:09.200 floppy disk needs to be in the computer 00:31:11.039 you know i don't know that the keyboard 00:31:12.320 plugs in there i didn't know there's a 00:31:14.000 separate on switch for the monitor right 00:31:16.000 so all of those things that i don't know 00:31:17.520 now keep me from having any opportunity 00:31:19.440 to get into whatever i'm trying to do 00:31:20.640 and trying to learn even though i'm 00:31:21.520 motivated to do that 00:31:23.120 um 00:31:25.120 i have a way to make this all more 00:31:26.559 succinct if you think about those six 00:31:28.159 things where those six things really 00:31:29.840 aren't six things there's only four 00:31:31.200 because the three that i have 00:31:31.919 highlighted are actually one thing or 00:31:33.360 potentially one thing right what what 00:31:35.840 what are the 00:31:37.120 under the underlying fundamental 00:31:38.480 principles of the discipline 00:31:40.159 those should make those should become 00:31:41.679 the goals of instruction practicing 00:31:43.200 those fundamental online and the only 00:31:45.200 way we'll know whether we've 00:31:46.000 accomplished what we set out to do with 00:31:47.840 learners is by evaluating whether or not 00:31:50.159 they can actually apply those things 00:31:51.360 that we've taught them in ways that 00:31:52.480 we've not explicitly shown them how to 00:31:53.519 do 00:31:54.799 and all of that starts with the 00:31:56.320 assessment all that starts by defining a 00:31:58.559 priori this is how i know somebody will 00:32:00.799 be able to 00:32:01.840 this is how i'll know that somebody 00:32:02.799 understands this thing what i'm teaching 00:32:04.080 them to do because they will behave this 00:32:05.600 way under these circumstances 00:32:07.600 um 00:32:08.640 i've shown this slide a long time but it 00:32:09.679 always is a hit uh i brought some data 00:32:11.440 from a typical freshman learner at the 00:32:12.880 university of texas at austin amount 00:32:14.240 learned is on the 00:32:15.679 y-axis one semester of time is going 00:32:17.200 across the axis 00:32:24.960 yeah there's midterms uh there's fine 00:32:27.279 final exams now 00:32:29.360 now there's there's a lot wrong with 00:32:30.559 that picture right not the least of 00:32:32.080 which is when you're right here and it's 00:32:33.760 two o'clock in the morning 00:32:35.440 and the test is at eight 00:32:37.039 and you're out of coffee and there's 00:32:38.240 just a few no-dose crumbs in the bottom 00:32:39.600 of your jar and you got two more 00:32:41.039 chapters to read and you turn the page 00:32:42.880 and it says for further interest turn to 00:32:44.720 appendix d you don't think well my let 00:32:46.559 me just take a moment and see what's in 00:32:47.679 i i don't have time for that right i 00:32:49.360 gotta i got this thing not 00:32:51.360 right 00:32:52.240 now that's part of what's wrong with it 00:32:53.440 the other thing is wrong with it is 00:32:54.799 there are such infrequent opportunities 00:32:56.480 to practice 00:32:57.760 using the information in various 00:32:59.440 contexts 00:33:00.559 right so the likelihood of its being 00:33:02.080 retrievable over the long term 00:33:03.440 advantageously is really really really 00:33:05.279 really really really really low 00:33:07.519 right now if you think about most 00:33:09.039 assessments 00:33:10.480 in higher education certainly they tend 00:33:12.000 to be 00:33:12.799 really high in magnitude really low in 00:33:14.320 frequency right they don't happen very 00:33:16.240 often and when they happen they matter a 00:33:17.519 ton 00:33:18.720 now how do you fix that well one thing 00:33:21.279 is 00:33:22.080 you have to flatten out this curve right 00:33:24.559 that there are things that are happening 00:33:25.760 all the time not any one of which 00:33:27.919 requires you know beautiful performance 00:33:30.880 so you can be messy and muddle and 00:33:33.279 confused in ways that teach you 00:33:35.200 something 00:33:36.159 right one of my favorite phrases that i 00:33:37.600 made up last year uh because i was 00:33:39.360 trying to talk to some group about 00:33:40.320 confusion and how good confusion was but 00:33:41.919 not just confusion of itself but 00:33:43.279 strategic confusion 00:33:44.960 you know i as your teacher 00:33:46.799 create strategic confusions for you 00:33:49.039 right that one right there and i want to 00:33:50.640 tell you if you want a model if you're a 00:33:52.080 faculty member you're thinking i've 00:33:52.960 never thought about this before how can 00:33:54.080 i get a model for that uh 00:33:56.480 go to the app store look at the most 00:33:58.320 popular video games on the app store and 00:34:00.480 buy one 00:34:01.919 right 00:34:02.720 i mean i'm 59 years old 00:34:05.200 i sit on airplanes 00:34:07.600 flipping birds out of a slingshot 00:34:10.159 to kill little green pigs who are trying 00:34:11.839 to steal the bird's eggs now what is 00:34:13.359 wrong with me you know that that would 00:34:15.199 motivate me to do that and by the way 00:34:16.639 i've been doing this for years you know 00:34:18.320 now why is that because you know the 00:34:19.760 authors of angry birds understand how 00:34:21.520 human beings learn 00:34:23.280 so what happens in the beginning of 00:34:24.239 angry birds right there's one bird one 00:34:26.399 pig all right almost no matter what you 00:34:28.480 do you could sneeze on the thing it'll 00:34:29.679 kill the pig right great but then now 00:34:32.079 now there's now there are more pigs and 00:34:33.918 then after a while one pig's under a 00:34:35.359 piece of wood 00:34:36.800 and now there's a different bird that 00:34:38.159 does a different thing 00:34:39.520 and all of this is strategically 00:34:41.440 introduced in a way that creates 00:34:43.839 challenges for challenges for me that 00:34:45.359 are inherently unsolvable 00:34:47.599 immediately 00:34:48.639 but they're solvable in the relative 00:34:50.159 near term 00:34:52.000 now to make this happen right 00:34:55.280 you got to do that 00:34:56.719 there have to be strategically organized 00:34:59.040 challenges that are not immediately 00:35:00.640 solvable but solvable in the relative 00:35:02.400 near term i mean i don't know what this 00:35:04.000 is what the statistic is in canada but 00:35:05.359 in the in the u.s over 50 of people who 00:35:08.079 finish all their courses and pass their 00:35:09.280 comprehensive exams never finish their 00:35:11.200 their just their dissertations and why 00:35:12.560 is that well where's the approximation 00:35:14.880 of that you know you're giving doing 00:35:17.599 assignments blow your mind into a 20 00:35:18.880 page paper here and there and then 00:35:20.000 somebody says okay go discover something 00:35:21.760 bring something back when you got 00:35:22.480 something to show me 00:35:23.680 you know how do i do that 00:35:25.680 right so again if we really want to set 00:35:27.440 people up in such a way that they're 00:35:28.480 able to apply what they know in ways 00:35:29.920 that are meaningful and manageable and 00:35:32.320 not discouraging that's something that 00:35:33.920 has to be practiced all on the way 00:35:35.200 because again there's an attitudinal 00:35:36.320 component to developing expertise right 00:35:38.000 it's not just knowing stuff is do you 00:35:39.520 have the right attitude about that when 00:35:40.720 you're confused how do you feel about 00:35:42.400 that what do you do in this in it when 00:35:44.240 you're in a state of confusion right how 00:35:45.920 do you adapt to the circumstances that 00:35:47.440 you're confronted with all those 00:35:48.320 questions that you could say more than i 00:35:49.839 can 00:35:50.560 um 00:35:51.280 okay so now you were watching the 00:35:52.640 harvard mit people make in front of them 00:35:54.079 now we get to make fun of ourselves i'd 00:35:55.359 like everyone to solve for x in your 00:35:57.200 head go sitting out loud just solve this 00:35:59.119 equation for x 00:36:00.640 i'll give you about 15 seconds shouldn't 00:36:02.079 take more than that 00:36:05.280 okay you put your minute i i have to 00:36:07.280 make a little teaching moment here 00:36:08.320 they're like what like 200 people in 00:36:09.280 this room and like like three guys raise 00:36:11.440 their hand and it's it's like when 00:36:12.640 you're not in fourth grade now the 00:36:14.160 question i ask all the faculty is why 00:36:16.160 the hell don't you raise your hand and 00:36:17.520 the answer that is the same reason your 00:36:18.800 students don't raise your hand when you 00:36:19.680 ask a question 00:36:21.920 because 00:36:26.800 that was your favorite part of the talk 00:36:27.839 wasn't it 00:36:29.839 now think about that for a minute right 00:36:32.320 now i know many of you know how to do 00:36:33.760 this so so what's the problem well the 00:36:35.440 problem is what if you raise your hand 00:36:37.040 and i called on you and you said three 00:36:38.640 eighths and i said well actually it's 00:36:40.000 not three eighths you know then what 00:36:42.400 well then nothing except if you did 00:36:44.079 raise your hand and i did call on you 00:36:45.200 and you did say three eighths i said 00:36:46.079 well she's not three that would be the 00:36:47.200 defining event of this week 00:36:49.920 you know you'll be late in bed in the 00:36:51.119 dark on saturday night going god why'd i 00:36:52.640 raise my hand on monday right 00:36:54.480 now 00:36:55.280 that that is that is intensely perverse 00:36:57.440 reaction to that except it's 00:36:58.800 understandable you have a reaction 00:36:59.760 because that's what school has taught 00:37:00.880 you right when i when i first started 00:37:03.040 teaching teaching school in public 00:37:04.640 school i was naive enthusiastic and 00:37:07.040 stupid and i found out that the 00:37:08.480 elementary school next to the high 00:37:09.359 school campus where i was directing 00:37:10.320 orchestra band didn't have enough music 00:37:11.839 teacher hours for the kindergartners and 00:37:12.960 first graders to have music so again 00:37:14.240 being stupid enthusiastic i got a 00:37:15.599 planning period you know what i'm gonna 00:37:16.640 do with that so i volunteered two days a 00:37:18.079 week to go to elementary school and 00:37:19.280 teach music to kn1 kids right so the 00:37:21.119 music teacher had regular classrooms so 00:37:22.240 i had a cart an audio visual cart like 00:37:23.680 that one uh except it was green that uh 00:37:25.680 had a record player on it you remember 00:37:27.119 records like really big cds and uh and 00:37:28.640 so i rolled this card around and had a 00:37:30.240 guitar on it it's a rhythm instruments 00:37:31.359 and the kids will see me roll this room 00:37:32.400 and say oh god it's time for me to say 00:37:33.280 what do you want to say yeah let's sing 00:37:34.640 we'll listen to music yeah beethoven 00:37:35.839 yeah he's good 00:37:37.200 they they were uninhibitedly 00:37:38.800 undiscriminatingly positive about 00:37:40.000 anything i wanted to do 00:37:41.280 and i would pose a question say i want 00:37:42.960 someone to raise your hands oh 00:37:43.839 everybody's hanging up they know i was 00:37:44.720 gonna ask i don't care pick me you know 00:37:47.599 now 00:37:48.880 i've now been teaching long enough 00:37:50.720 that those same children 00:37:52.240 have grown to be young adults 00:37:55.280 and they've become my stressed 00:37:57.359 oppressed 00:37:59.520 great anxious 00:38:01.200 graduate students 00:38:02.640 and now i'm sitting around a seminar 00:38:03.599 table i say i like someone who talks 00:38:04.800 just a minute everybody looks at the 00:38:05.520 table 00:38:07.040 you know like taking notes like god 00:38:08.000 don't call on me i'm thinking what 00:38:09.119 happened to you what took that bright 00:38:10.800 open with it pick me i don't know what 00:38:12.079 the hell's going on let's try anyway you 00:38:13.599 know 00:38:14.480 what happened to you and the only 00:38:15.599 uncommon variable i can think ran 00:38:16.720 through all their past experiences they 00:38:17.839 all went to school 00:38:20.720 right and school took that and turned it 00:38:22.400 into well look out right and 00:38:25.119 very effectively very systematically 00:38:27.040 completely unintentionally 00:38:29.119 right i mean what do we tell you all the 00:38:30.480 time be creative but be sure you get 00:38:32.640 this one right 00:38:33.760 well that's not the way creativity works 00:38:35.359 right i mean okay anyway so we're back 00:38:37.040 to this again so somebody who raised 00:38:38.000 their hand would you raise your hand 00:38:38.800 again so i could would you tell me 00:38:40.079 answer three two three two three three 00:38:41.839 over two years after one and a half 00:38:43.200 right would you tell me your name 00:38:44.240 brandon brent 00:38:46.960 which is correct now unless brandon or 00:38:48.560 anybody else how did you get to that 00:38:49.839 from there 00:38:50.800 well multiply three over three four by 00:38:52.880 two 00:38:53.680 and why do you do that 00:38:55.920 yeah this is the universal symbol for 00:38:57.200 this equation yeah you do that right 00:38:59.200 okay so so brandon says correctly that 00:39:00.720 you do that to the to the thing on the 00:39:02.480 other side right and then you let you go 00:39:03.839 six over four or three or two and you're 00:39:04.880 reducing it one and now okay so here's 00:39:06.320 my question i would ask brandon and 00:39:07.359 everybody else if you've already 00:39:08.000 answered somebody else why do you why do 00:39:09.680 you do that why do you invert the 00:39:10.640 divisor 00:39:12.880 yeah crickets right okay now 00:39:14.960 i would say so so you don't feel bad for 00:39:16.720 the past i don't know 18 years i give 00:39:18.160 the opening talk on teaching for the 00:39:19.200 faculty of texas for the new faculty or 00:39:20.880 orientation techniques we probably hire 00:39:22.000 120 new faculty a year 00:39:23.599 and i put this slide up now i got 120 00:39:25.760 you know people with terminal degrees in 00:39:27.200 the audience and you know there's 00:39:28.079 somebody raise your hand and tell me 00:39:29.119 what the answer is and five guys raise 00:39:30.160 your hand they're all in the math 00:39:30.720 department uh 00:39:32.320 and and i asked him the same thing right 00:39:33.760 now brandon says right what why why do 00:39:35.599 you have to divide because that's what 00:39:36.640 you do to do it right now the best thing 00:39:38.800 i ever got i was in a room full of 00:39:39.760 fitness once i wrote this equation on 00:39:40.800 the board would say all that right and i 00:39:42.400 and i said why why do you invert the 00:39:43.440 divisor and this kid will realize if you 00:39:45.040 don't get it wrong 00:39:47.280 what better rationale does one need than 00:39:49.119 that right 00:39:50.880 now for all of you mathematically 00:39:52.240 inclined in here you recognize that the 00:39:53.760 rationale for inverting the divisor is 00:39:55.040 the only interesting thing about that 00:39:56.160 equation 00:39:57.920 right which is unlike the way 00:39:59.680 mathematicians think about numbers by 00:40:00.880 the way i mean this this symbol that 00:40:02.480 doesn't exist in any mathematics books 00:40:03.839 except in school right it's not the way 00:40:05.680 things work in real math right now the 00:40:07.839 thing to consider is this 00:40:09.280 if the goal of an institution is to get 00:40:10.720 rooms full of disparate people getting 00:40:12.640 the right answer for that one way to do 00:40:14.960 it is to put lots of questions just like 00:40:17.359 that with different numbers in them and 00:40:18.640 teach people to go invert and multiply 00:40:19.920 multiply multiply multiply and you'll 00:40:21.520 get everybody getting the right answer 00:40:23.599 without 00:40:24.400 any requirement that anybody knows what 00:40:25.520 they're doing 00:40:27.119 and in school we're really good at that 00:40:30.000 and students who are good at school are 00:40:31.520 really good at that 00:40:32.880 now i'm not saying that the things are 00:40:34.160 usually exclusive that if you can do 00:40:35.200 that you then you must not know what 00:40:36.640 you're doing i'm just saying it's 00:40:37.599 possible to not know what you're doing 00:40:39.599 right and and my argument today is it 00:40:41.599 shouldn't be possible to not know what 00:40:42.640 you're doing and still get the right 00:40:43.520 answer right but as long as i'm asking 00:40:45.440 you to do things that i've explicitly 00:40:46.560 shown you how to do and you've been 00:40:47.760 paying attention and you're motivated to 00:40:49.440 learn well why wouldn't you get the 00:40:50.720 right answer right but if i change my 00:40:53.520 goal and my goal is no longer to teach 00:40:55.119 you how to get the right answer it's 00:40:56.560 teaching you how to be optimally 00:40:57.920 confused 00:40:59.520 and to use your confusion in a way that 00:41:02.079 causes you to think differently about 00:41:03.520 the thing that you're doing that's a 00:41:04.880 whole different goal now 00:41:06.960 there's there's a downside for this for 00:41:08.240 faculty because as students you all know 00:41:10.079 i don't like being confused 00:41:12.000 and for somebody to say i'm going to 00:41:13.200 evaluate you by having you come in and 00:41:14.800 i'm going to ask you something i haven't 00:41:15.680 shown you how to do what's the student 00:41:16.800 say what the hell's wrong with you this 00:41:18.240 is school you're supposed to show me how 00:41:19.359 to do it and then i'll do it right so 00:41:21.440 this requires a shift in thinking on 00:41:23.359 everybody's part right but that only 00:41:25.839 works 00:41:27.040 if the way we evaluate and the way we 00:41:29.520 give credit isn't based solely on 00:41:32.079 getting the right answer that i've shown 00:41:33.040 you how to get okay and i well i don't 00:41:34.800 have time for that at all 00:41:36.160 um 00:41:37.040 okay so i so i i i have two thoughts uh 00:41:39.520 to kind of leave you with before we open 00:41:40.640 the floor for questions okay and one is 00:41:42.240 this as a teacher you're a learner too 00:41:45.200 i mean i'm doing a terrible job of 00:41:46.640 teaching today because i don't know you 00:41:48.480 all well enough to know what's going on 00:41:50.240 in your head 00:41:51.599 and if i'm going to teach you 00:41:52.319 effectively i need to know what you're 00:41:53.599 doing 00:41:54.480 what's your thinking 00:41:55.760 and so i have to provide opportunities 00:41:57.359 every day that reveal to you and to me 00:42:00.240 gaps in your thinking that might not be 00:42:01.680 visible 00:42:02.480 right anything well goodness you can't 00:42:03.839 do that in class of 200. of course you 00:42:05.040 can we just did it today 00:42:07.040 right because if you were in my class 00:42:08.400 today i would take up the things that 00:42:09.599 you wrote and i would look at them not 00:42:11.440 to grade i'd look at them just to get an 00:42:13.040 idea of where people's heads are in the 00:42:14.480 room 00:42:15.359 right and i might actually talk to a 00:42:17.839 particular person because i thought they 00:42:18.880 wrote something particularly insightful 00:42:20.160 on the thing i had them write for five 00:42:21.359 minutes that day or i might find 00:42:22.960 somebody else who's completely in the 00:42:24.000 weeds and go find them as well to 00:42:26.160 unweedify them and try to help them get 00:42:27.839 to a place where they understand this a 00:42:28.720 little bit better right but i can't do 00:42:30.880 that if i'm just talking and you're all 00:42:32.240 just sitting there because i don't know 00:42:33.680 enough about what you're doing so the 00:42:35.040 first central idea you're a learner too 00:42:37.040 and then the the bigger essential idea 00:42:38.960 is learning is error correction 00:42:40.960 and by error correction i don't mean 00:42:42.319 students making a mistake and my 00:42:43.520 correcting it i mean students making 00:42:45.200 mistakes and then working through their 00:42:46.640 own problems 00:42:48.000 right 00:42:48.720 so rather than my being the person who 00:42:50.079 solves it for you or for shows you or or 00:42:52.079 who shows you what you did wrong i'm the 00:42:53.520 person who has set up 00:42:55.520 experiences where you can be 00:42:56.640 advantageously confused 00:42:58.560 and muddle 00:43:00.160 because the model is where the learning 00:43:01.280 happens right we and we don't typically 00:43:02.720 value muddling uh many students see 00:43:05.359 muddling as a waste of time and again 00:43:07.599 they don't see that as a waste of time 00:43:08.560 because they inherently see it as a 00:43:09.599 waste of time we taught them to see it 00:43:11.200 as a waste of time because their 00:43:13.280 thinking coming into a learning 00:43:14.400 environment is i need to get from here 00:43:15.599 to the right answer as quickly and 00:43:16.720 efficiently as i possibly can and 00:43:18.160 learning is not efficient 00:43:19.839 learning is a mess 00:43:22.160 and all of us know if you've ever 00:43:23.599 written a book or conducted a good 00:43:24.880 experiment or written a grant that got 00:43:26.400 funded or whatever we know it's a mess 00:43:29.839 right it's not linear it's not clean 00:43:32.240 it's frustrating it's all those things 00:43:34.160 right but the way we teach learners to 00:43:36.160 develop those attitudes has to involve 00:43:38.160 their having approximations of those 00:43:39.920 experiences in the classes that they 00:43:41.760 take all the all the time except that 00:43:43.760 can't happen if we're only evaluating 00:43:45.280 them based on their known stuff right i 00:43:47.599 mean many of my colleagues ask questions 00:43:48.880 like you know on on a test tell me about 00:43:51.040 your most interesting failure at this 00:43:53.599 now most of us would think how could a 00:43:54.800 failure be interesting 00:43:56.160 well that that they're really 00:43:57.760 interesting if you actually cook them 00:43:59.040 right right but if failure means the 00:44:01.119 answer was supposed to be that and i 00:44:02.000 wrote that well it's not very 00:44:03.280 interesting right but if you think how 00:44:04.720 could i misconstrue the cause of seasons 00:44:07.119 on the earth as being distance when it 00:44:08.640 really isn't distance but the angle of 00:44:10.000 light waves striking the atmosphere now 00:44:11.760 i've got something interesting to talk 00:44:12.560 about right because now i have a reason 00:44:14.960 for my misconstrual because i do know 00:44:17.280 from my own experience that as i become 00:44:19.119 as i move closer to a heat source i feel 00:44:21.200 more of the heat 00:44:22.400 right but doing that with the earth with 00:44:24.560 the sun would be like 00:44:26.560 mine now taking two steps that way to a 00:44:28.800 heater that's in new jersey you know 00:44:30.880 it's not going to make any difference 00:44:32.480 but once you understand that you think 00:44:33.760 about the problem entirely differently 00:44:35.200 and enough experiences like that get you 00:44:36.960 to think about problems in general 00:44:38.560 entirely differently and i think any of 00:44:40.560 us who teach have that as an ultimate 00:44:42.319 goal we'd like people to be in a place 00:44:43.920 where confronting problems is not 00:44:45.839 something that stops you in your tracks 00:44:47.359 but something that prompts you to think 00:44:49.040 about things that you might not have 00:44:50.000 thought about before so becoming 00:44:51.440 comfortable with that idea that i don't 00:44:52.720 know the answer i don't know what to do 00:44:54.240 and now i've got to try out some things 00:44:55.359 and see what happens is an important 00:44:57.119 feature of every learning experience for 00:44:58.480 every learner at every age whatever that 00:45:00.079 happens to be 00:45:01.359 i can go on for days but i won't i'll 00:45:03.200 spare you uh and i was asked to leave 00:45:04.800 some type of questions and i see that we 00:45:05.839 have 14 minutes left so i will do that 00:45:07.280 if anybody has to be somewhere else i 00:45:08.480 won't be offended if you leave before 00:45:09.440 the questioning time uh but let me thank 00:45:11.520 uh 00:45:12.319 mcmaster university the president all 00:45:14.319 the people who've been involved in my 00:45:15.200 coming here staff faculty everybody 00:45:16.880 thank you so much and thank you for your 00:45:17.760 attention today thanks",

                "content": "all right welcome to productivity book group I'm your host and facilitator Ray Sydney Smith uh thanks for listening in on productivity book groups discussion of work clean the life-changing power of Mison plus to organize your life work and Mind by Dan charnis if you have the paper book or the hardcover book you may see it under the title of everything in its place so just in case anyone is confused it goes by both names we're clean and everything in its place a little bit about the author and the book before we get started I am pulling some of this from the Amazon author description as well as from his own website but it says here harness journalist screenwriter record producer and teacher was one of the first writers for the source and helped to create hip-hop journalism turns holds a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University he writes about culture race and politics for a number of Publications he's an associate Arts professor at the Clive Davis Institute of recorded music at New York University and he's also the author of The Big Payback the history of the business of hip-hop and he's got a forthcoming book called dilatime The Life and after life of Jay Dilla the hip-hop producer who reinvented Rhythm and charnis has been actually also been a teacher of Kundalini Yoga for uh it says nearly a decade but I think it's actually nearly two decades he's certified by the Kundalini Research Institute and he teaches classes in New York and contributes to yogajournal.com a bit about the book uh from again the Amazon description quoting chefs across the globe have honed an incredible system for working with efficiency called misoplas and work clean Dan charnis reveals how to use those principles and any kind of work outside the kitchen work clean spells out 10 major principles of Mison Plus or putting in place for chefs and non-chefs alike one by one China shows how applying each of these principles at the office and at home creates a simple system for organizing your life work and mind and so with that out of the way oh end quote with that out of the way uh let's get into what your initial thoughts were of work clean what'd you think of the book what were the what were what was your initial impression of work clean by Dan charnis Frank you want to kick us off oh yeah yeah this was my second reading of the book um liked it the first time loved it the second time you know I've kind of always thought that that good Cooks I just have to be organized people by Nature you know the end result the goal quote in quotes is uh you know that meal that's on the table and each part of the meal you know you have to start cooking it at the right time and so forth so that everything comes together at the end and you have to have all your ingredients there which means you had to have planned and you have to go into the grocery store at the right time to get the right stuff it's like Cooks chefs are the ultimate organizers so what better than a book written from the perspective of a a chef um I'll jump in here um it was uh I think I had a general idea of what museum plus was about uh before reading it um and um yeah the the book basically lived up to everything I I kind of hoped it would be um really instructive stories about the different the different practices that are kind of that are that are part of these implos um and um the thing that really I won't go too deep into it but the thing that really struck me about it and made me um you know just attracted me to it is that the um the structure and order that it requires is like the exact thing that um that I with um you know kind of attention problems um and all the all the commensurate kind of issues that go with it just kind of need um and then it occurred to me that like you know I I you know what Frank what you were talking about uh being in the kitchen and having to um make sure you have everything and do your prep um have the tools um figure out what needs to go in the oven at what time what needs to go on a stove at the time right which is something I really enjoy doing like at the holidays like that's my I do a lot of the cooking in the house and it's like there's there's all this stuff to kind of organize but I love it you know that's like I'm and um I'm thinking like okay you know chefs are I think the chefs in general maybe people you know or people who who are attracted to Kitchen work May they require that kind of stimulation of that um of being in a kitchen and having a very specific thing you've got to get done you've got to get you know um or a series of things you've got to get done because you are on the clock and you gotta like you know you gotta um so I'll I'll stop there but um I think the uh everything about it it was it was just fantastic so glad to hear glad to hear anyone else what was your what was your kind of first largest impressions of the book while you're all thinking I will I will throw in my thoughts here which is that this is probably in my top 10 favorite productivity books so it's not something I I'm I'm very biased because it's it's gone into rotation as one of my annual reads and I am just really always pleased when I read it and every time I read it I think oh man I shouldn't have read this sooner to refresh me on all the things that I just enjoy about the book one it's it's actually well written and uh you know just the the book moves you feel a sense of that from my perspective uh and he puts in just enough story to create a narrative the book is organized well in terms of the flow of teaching and if you don't want to like get into the pieces you could just jump to course three which the book is organized in three courses and three parts and so you have that opportunity to kind of jump to the end of the book and just read the how-to part and refresh yourself in terms of what he talks about in terms of the daily knees and those other pieces we can get into that in a little bit later the discussion but I I really just always appreciate the book I just every time I sit down I think you know this is a really well organized well-ordered narrative and I appreciate the I appreciate each of the things even though I don't agree with all of the pieces of the system or the methodology I'm not going to do all of them but the pieces that I always lift from it resonates with me at the time and no other book does that for me as well as say getting things done by David Allen or even the eighth happened by Dr Steven cuppy which you all know I uh adore both of those books as well and you know you step in that each of those books and they resonate with you at a different point in place in your own life and I feel like this book does that same thing for me it's it gives me an opportunity to think and and to reflect on on the different parts of my system yeah right one thing that I found you for the person who may not be a chef and I think for and for those who are chefs who really appreciate the art of cooking and they're good at it there will be a lot of the book that resonates with them whereas those of us who are are part of the cycle is the eating part of the cycle that's where my strengths are um in the print version you've got pages with gray borders and Pages without gray borders and if you just read the pages with the gray borders that's all the stuff about how the analogy of how it applies to the world of work rather than here's all of the cooking stuff um and and to me one important part of the book was how it talks about just the way physical things are laid out sometimes you don't even have to put something on your to-do list because the physical object is the reminder you know and I see that when I go into Waffle House you know and I order my you know my waffle and my side order of bacon and the waitress says uh to the Cook you know pull one bacon and they pull in and they pull raw bacon and lay it out and so now to the cook raw bacon laying over there means put that bacon on the grill they don't exactly know who the bacon is for but uncooked bacon laying there is the trigger to cook the bacon and so many times in our world just the physical thing laying out is the trigger to do whatever with that option um so Ray I'll talk about my impression of the book um go for it I didn't hate it don't get the wrong impression for my hesitancy um so I I can see if you do no I don't at all not at all not in any way shape or form um but I I consider myself someone who loves to cook I wouldn't consider myself a cook and I'm definitely not a chef I'm the antithesis of what this book is so I never prepare I don't plan when I cook it's like what's in the cupboard and I throw it together and something magical happens and I'm just lucky that way or I don't know I just that's how I cook so this is a very interesting for me because I pretty much felt like not only I knew about me's because I've taken a baking class and you can't bake like that right baking is a totally different thing you can't just play around you've got a science not art but um yeah it was really eye-opening for me as to how this could be helpful for me in the kitchen but also in my life because I tend to just kind of work like that or it's there's less prep and more like kind of random happening but also my relationship with time is not uh accurate so for me that that was the one of the biggest things besides the spatial thing the getting to understand how time works and understanding how chefs use time blocking to you know like really serious like this is going to take me five minutes this is and then I have to do this you know step by step that was very helpful to me so I I really enjoyed the book but I want to say what you said about um going to the third course so I was getting so excited about the book about I don't know probably about halfway through I was getting so excited I just wanted to know like what's the system I'm enjoying all these stories about chefs and what they do but like what's the system so I jumped to the third course and I think that's the first time I've ever done that in a book I do not allow myself and it was very freeing I was like oh I could go and read the end and then come back and finish the rest and that's what I did and I really it made me enjoy the book more because I knew what I was heading towards but yeah so I'm finding it um I'm very excited to implement a lot of what's in this book so well unlike you Linda I immediately jumped to the end of the book after I read the table with contents the first time around and I read that section first so that when I was reading through the narrative pieces I felt more control over what was going on and it was actually really helpful for me that first time around yeah and I think if you have a productivity system and you you're already you know you're not a beginner at all this stuff I think that's the way to read this book read the third course and then go and read the rest of it you then you can enjoy it maybe you know other people might need a little bit more stepping in but yeah I I think but for me it was hard because it was like oh you're reading it out of order my perspective is that this is not a detective novel I need to know what I'm going to be doing so that I can get con like it's actually helpful for me to get kind of the lattice work the framework so that I can then rest that part of my brain and actually just like enjoy the material and this last time around I actually listened to the audiobook uh while I was reading it which was actually a really interesting kind of like to read the differences between the audiobook and the uh the written version which that was very limited but it was still nice to be able to read and listen at the same time to kind of digest and also to see the the charts alongside the audiobook was also helpful as he was describing uh as he was describing the method and talking about things seeing the visuals and kind of dwelling on those was actually also really helpful as well any other initial thoughts go for it Pietro you're muted in Pietro go ahead and unmute yourself okay sorry about that um I really enjoyed this book um I think a lot of people try to live by the adage a place for everything and everything in its place um but a lot of people struggle what struck me about this book is that it was uh talking about chefs and Cooks being in their workplace and needing a system for for organization a system for a method a system for a process and yet for those of us who have worked in uh offices companies private sector companies public sector organization what do you notice about your co-workers when it comes to their uh habits around the kitchen or the kitchen app uh they leave dirty coffee cups everywhere but I know that these same people don't do that in their in their own homes you know I just know you know like I've been to some of my co-workers they just keep their homes uh immaculate so then that led me to think what about people in professions who don't like to have everything in the neat order and don't like to put things back you know I think about certain uh certain very very um established professionals um Eddie Greenspan was Canada's most famous criminal defense lawyer he died a number of years ago if you know his name it might be because he he represented Conrad black who at one time owned the Chicago sometimes and had a trial in the US and a few years ago Eddie Greenspan before uh before the very first day of the trial he would lay everything out on his office floor and he had a massive office um and that's what he needed to do you know um now you might argue well he had everything laid out on the floor because he's thinking you know okay I need uh these briefings here I need these files here and so forth but you know he could also like misplay easily misplace something but um that's what in Canada's most successful uh criminal uh defense lawyer the only other uh thought I'm gonna I'm gonna uh uh offer is that while reading the book I started thinking about how maybe the environment can be too sterile um when you're thinking about having everything ready everything prepared [Music] um and so are chefs and Cooks like uh really good chefs and Cooks like automatons you know you know exactly where everything is right they've laid everything out beforehand um when they're studying at The Culinary Institute of America and then they do the externship you know they actually write out checklists you know and Dan charnis recommends you know that they spend 30 minutes um or sorry he writes that they spend 30 minutes a day doing that you know just sort of like people who do a getting things done Daily Review but then he also writes that he knows that those um students are gonna stop doing that you know once they start working in in the real world because they've been training it you know um for example doing Dwayne De Puma's um restaurant which is Affiliated and that just led me to something else these people are internalizing what they have to do David Allen says you know the mind is not a very good office uh the mind is not for for holding ideas yeah I I think that there's a couple of things that come to mind related to your comments Pietro which is that you know I believe that most chefs do not do this I would say most Cooks do not do this and the delineation that charnis is trying to make between those uh is is very important and that yes there comes a point where uh there is an internalization of many of these pieces that it becomes a mental skill like when you go to law school you're taught to to uh think you talk to think logically uh Medical School you are given a body of knowledge to memorize and then to do a bit of detective work at the end right so it's like each of these professions has their skill sets and to be a chef to go from cook to Chef in in charnis's kind of thoughts here in these interviews he interviewed 100 different chefs you know the idea is is that you go through this transformation this maturation in the way in which you organize and manage this particular World Daniel yeah so for my eyesight just first impression because when you pick that book right I I was like oh what I'm going to learn from uh chefs or Cooks in terms of productivity because there wouldn't have been a book I normally pick for productivity and I used to work as a waiter and so on work very close I think with Cooks um back then back in the days in Germany and for me there was no system whatsoever they just streamed all the time we're sweating all the time and where it was just not a nice work environment so when then and then I read the book title and and it says okay what we can learn from cooks in that case about productivity I thought I don't think that I think I could have learned and then I read that book and I have to say she said it was very well written I think that there was obviously a absolute plus point but also I did not know that birthday is such a difference between chef and Cooks but then also that whole productivity system they developed over time and had to develop over time to be such efficient cooks and then also from a productivity standpoint knowing how under so much pressure they can operate and produce consistent quality really got me open the whole new world to me and I thought that was very interesting now outside the productivity obviously there are some gold nuggets in there but just the idea that I I did not think there is something to learn and now all of a sudden I appreciate every blade which comes out of the restaurant five times more because there's so much thought behind the systems they use uh from productivity to standpoint which I didn't know before so for me that was very yeah right before the pandemic um I'd been in Paris and there was this little tiny kitchen in this little tiny hole in the wall restaurant and this chef and he had a sous chef uh were making dishes for probably I don't know but maybe 45 50 tables in this restaurant and I just remember seeing that and I I think I just read work clean for the first time and I had that same sense of appreciation Daniel of the fact that this little tiny kitchen I mean like they were crammed together I thought I would not want to ever work in this environment and yet there was this kind of orchestral Symphony type movement between them they were just moving in synchrony they were just churning out plates of really high quality food and I was really I you know I I had that great appreciation for it at that moment you know it's like who to look at when you want to turn out high quality consistently high quality work I mean who's under more pressure than these tops I mean I don't want to use the word Top Chef because that's now another thing but chefs who are at that level where they are high quality all the time they're not the line Cooks who are just like you know don't have the training and just doing the best they can with what they've got I mean to be able to do that with with something that's perishable this is a really good group of people to look at to translate to the less pressured world of yeah the paper is not going to disintegrate as I sit here I don't if I don't pick it up right it's going to take a lot more time than it will for the basil that you just chopped up you know which I don't know that like three seconds it turns ugly um so but you know I mean it's to me I was amazed by I mean I've eaten at CIA so I know that experience right of eating this food that is prepared perfectly and you wonder yourself like how do they do it they're getting this stuff coming in and then they're just outputting it in a timely fashion in most you know those top places it's a timely fashion it's not like you're waiting an hour or two for your food so it's it's a good group of people to look at I think um I think what uh Melinda what you're saying there it's really about you know what kind what level of standard do we want to uh do we want to achieve right you can you know and that's got to be that's standards for service that's standard for Quality that's standards for cost uh all those things um you know go into saying like Okay well what what kind of system do I need to be able to produce at this at a certain level and um and this is kind of it for um for producing like you know very high quality output on you know even and to be honest I did not really even I'm on the I got the audiobook I'm on my second listen through of it and I've just been trying to I've just been like implementing a little parts of it into um into my into my work day and um yeah I'm I'm not sure that I'm going the the system itself I actually it's it's funny how you as we're saying like you went right to it um I just kind of skipped that part I listened to it um but I've just been looking at ways to integrate some of the uh the concepts into what I'm already doing I really appreciate the way he organized this book too because he highlighted the pages you can't see with my bad life but he highlighted the pages where there's actual things to do in each chapter so you can go back after you read it without having to reread the book or search I've read productivity books that were like and I won't mention the names where you're like there is no way to find the information that you need to get this done because I cannot find it whereas he's got this very you know and it's laid out really well it's it's nicely done yeah and that that's the other thing so there's only I think one other book that I put in that Echelon there's a there's a couple of really well laid out books in the productivity world but super better is probably one of those that stands out to me where Dr Jane McGonagall has just or whoever the book designer is has laid it out in such a way that the information stands distinct so that you're able to go through the book like that and we're clean is another one where the details also match the the analogy like the theme it you know like everything just kind of fits right and you don't you don't notice those details in normal everyday books until it's done so well and you're like oh this is what every book should look like you know it's kind of a work of art by itself and I really appreciated that as well he's not trying to force the analogies they're actual it's not like he's trying I gotta make ten you know there are 10 ingredients but isn't like he's trying to push for ten there were 10 things that you know right right exactly and so I just wanted to run through those so so that you know folks who may be listening later are not kind of taken off place but misoplas he talks about as having 10 major principles the 10 ingredients of the methodology and I'll run through them we can talk about any one of those that you um would like to but he talks about the first is planning is prime he then says arranging spaces and perfecting movements I really love the uh there was one section in the book where he talks about the the chef who talks about its um Myspace my uh my place my pace something like that but it was like it was just a really nice interesting kind of flow of of turn of phrase and uh then number three is cleaning as you go number four making first moves and the importance of first moves five finishing actions but principle of completion number six slowing down to speed up number seven call and call back the importance of good communication eight open ears and eyes nine inspect and correct kind of almost a Kaizen approach to it and then number 10 total utilization so those are the ten principles of Mison plus as he talks about it and then the methodology in the system itself I found to be a lot more forgiving there were major kind of chunks of how he described what you should do but much of it gives you a lot of flexibility to be able to implement it in a way that you uh uh you have a lot of flexibility there is is basically my point so uh where do you want to dive in what were the major pieces that kind of jumped out for you I want to dive into process and immersive that whole thing because I think that's really for me was a real like oh yeah you can like get things started and while the those are going you can do this you know so-called what we call what Ray people not Rey call Deep work but you know it's like thank you for the clarification yes and I love that part where he talked about that I was like I thought about you the whole time I was reading that but like this morning I was making my avocado toast and my latte and I was like if you don't get that toast in now this whole thing's gonna go wrong and you're gonna have cold coffee right so I and I was like I've done that before where I didn't get the toast in in time or the toaster didn't work or whatever but like I started thinking yeah you got to start thinking like this what are the things you can do that you can set into motion that will be going while like laundry was a good one too I love that I was like you know you can put laundry in and it's gonna be going while you can do other things or I'm sure there's lots of good examples but I I thought that and raising process time up to its level of not degrading it because it's not quote unquote creative or whatever and saying it's actually could possibly be more important because you're getting things going that you don't have to put energy into while while you're able to do other stuff so I really like that I won't get on the soapbox but this is one of my problems with deep work and shallow work right because you know if you think of process time and immersive time the way that charnis describes it process time can be rather simple easy to execute front-end items and they save copious amounts of time and delay by virtue of doing those things and so if you then presume that somehow deep work is more important work then you're missing a huge element of how you can actually be productive in any given environment especially a kitchen but I mean as charnis has shown this is widely and broadly applicable and so you know I use the terms Focus work and flow work for different purposes but I feel like immersive and process process time also fits into that perspective for me immersive work I would pretty closely align with flow work for me getting into the state of flow whereas with Focus work those are a series of actions you've grouped together other by context to do and that by itself is not necessarily only process time because it could actually also be some other kinds of work that are solely your work that needs to be done and they're just administrative tasks or other kinds of tasks that need to be done but I really appreciate that and I he adds meeting time as well so he separates meeting time then immersive time and then process time so don't know that there are those three and I also like the simplification of it in some way shape or form it doesn't appeal to me but I like the fact that he says it's all actions you know it's don't try and like split it apart into separate things they're all just actions but you're now managing these blocks of time where you're getting these things done I can appreciate that on that on that puzzle yeah yeah and the part where he talked about you know it's not about getting the most important thing done first and then the next most important thing it's it's just it's getting things lined up so that you do have that flow and that one thing leads to the next in and and it just it just works um yeah but not the most important thing the the thing that needs to be done first isn't necessarily the most important thing it's like your boss sends you an email I need to talk to you and you're like but I have important like creative immersive work to do and I'll do all that then I'll talk to my boss and they're like oh that project I gave you that you just worked two hours on you don't need to do we cancel out you know that kind of thing it's like what needs to actually happen first for other things to be work more smoothly or work at all yeah it's like doing this little thing then allows you to move to the next thing and eventually something significant happens at the end and even if it not sequential there's that momentum thing getting a bunch of little tasks out of the way so that you can focus can sometimes just give you the momentum to keep going as opposed to like oh yeah I gotta I gotta go remember yeah yeah and see and Linda their their productivity books that would say now doing all those little things that's just a way of procrastinating and not doing that thing you really need to be doing well you know at at some point if you don't do the little things you're not able to do the wonderful you know if you don't change the air filter eventually you're calling the repairman because the air conditioner now no longer works you know who's going to empty the dishwasher you know if you don't empty it at some point there are no more clean dishes you know what I'm gonna do now uh so it's you know oh I only do the important work no it all needs to get done just figure out a way that that makes it happen systematically where it's where it's easy you know life life could be easier than we make it I was thinking through as I was reading the book and he he talked about the idea that he you know kind of stumbled upon this profession that has necessitated this system this methodology of Mison plus I started thinking of all of the other and he lightly touched on like Pilots obviously they have a well-worn system of learning how to Pilot especially in emergencies and so I was thinking like there's probably a lot of other professions that have these let's call them productivity methodologies and now I'm like I'm kind of hell-bent on binding all of them you know like does waste management have their own productivity system you know because if you don't take waste out uh it has the same problem as food right uh and so you'll you'll know really quickly if the garbage or the toilet isn't isn't draining properly and so you know there must be these other um kind of natural order systems that have developed over the years and I'm I'm really curious to see that I mean a few years ago I went through all of the cultural uh kind of systems uh from hyuga you know in the kind of nordics and uh and then you know we have um what's the name of the Hawaiian there's a Hawaiian productivity system there's a bunch of different systems that are like culturally uh specific and I'm I'm now curious about whether or not there are profession specific ones as well um that kind of match up with uh with how Nissan Plus has developed um I wanted to talk a little bit about total utilization because total utilization has this like really interesting appeal to me but it could also lead one to Obsession and so you know he talks about the idea that if you're if a chef or cook is Walking In One Direction with some you know dishes to the sink then they'd be walking you know by the the fridge make sure they pick up some of the items in the fridge on the way back to their chef station and it's this idea that you want to be in continuous uh production when you are on and that way you are you're just fully utilizing but also all of the resources involved right you're going to use all of the parts of the meat you're using you're going to use all of the parts of the vegetables you're using you're not going to waste where you where you don't need to waste and I I thought that's really great and it's something that I think we can all appreciate within reason uh but then you know there are folks who will then take that to the nth degree and they will overwork potentially burnout and and Zone support so I want anyone who may be thinking that oh you know like total utilization means I should be working you know all the hours of my waking day and not resting not rejuvenating that is not what's being said here and it's really important to kind of keep that in mind to me it was more like work smarter not harder I mean as far as the the using space and you know you don't walk to the refrigerator six times to get six things you take a tray and you put them all in there and you get them all over to your space so I mean I think it's not about working harder it's about being smarter about it I just said that already and I'm sure these things develop for chefs over time um you know and because they're always pressured with getting the meal out as quickly as possible but a high quality meal you know no nobody wants to go well yeah I know the food's really good here but gosh you had to wait for three hours you know you're you know you can't sustain a business like that so they're always under the gun to get it done as quickly as they can uh but high quality so you just start developing these routines over time you know so that when you go to the refrigerator you're getting like all the refrigerator stuff and you and you have as many things going on you know this so we get this cooking so that now I can go over here and so it's sort of like the ultimate multitasking good the good kind of multitasking where a number of things are in motion at the same time and they make it look easy you know like the juggler they all have to have it out at the same time too you don't want your dish coming in five seconds or five minutes after your friend next to use dish and that so it's like you had you have six managers and you have to get their six projects to those managers all the same day can you imagine like same hour and they're doing that constantly so that's it's to me it's amazing I mean it's nice to see behind the scenes of what creates that because right yeah I mean it was always a mystery getting those start times coordinated um because oh I'll save a little time I'll just go ahead and throw this on and then well it's done too early and yeah it's just it's it might be worse than having it too late but it's really knowing your work and I think for me that was one of the things like I don't really know I don't know how long that time things take so I can't really make an estimate so I can't really schedule things out because I'm not aware of that so until you really know your work and you're really being where he has you do that thing where you write down how long you know to log your time to see how long it takes to do different things and I thought that was really interesting because that's something for me it's like oh yeah I'd love to make a plan but what am I basing that plan on a really warped sense of time you know I can get anywhere in 15 well I live in Southern California I can get anywhere in 30 minutes right um not over 50 minutes 15 minutes and and it's not real you know it takes five minutes to get some places in 45 minutes to an hour to get to others but it's that weird warped sense of yeah this is only going to take me people say that oh let's gonna take me a few seconds and I don't know anything it takes a few seconds and breathing yeah um it's kind of sensitivity to to time you know how long things take and um just not not allowing yourself to just get lost in whatever you're doing um you know I just you know when I get into something it's you know you just lose track of of time I mean they call it like time blindness the um is like one term for it um and I've you know I think there's uh I would be really interested to know any you know other people's like ideas about how that they like you know work with time um you know and increase their time Sensitivity I mean obviously there's the I mean the things that I've gone are have certainly helped you know using a Time Track or using toggle to track my time and um setting alarms and doing all that um that stuff but um like really being like committed and disciplined to being like this is the amount of time I'm putting in I'm gonna give this thing I can only give this thing this amount of time today um uh and you know um is you know something that I I'm not quite there yet so yeah I think something something to keep in mind I mean in my very early days of work I kept a spreadsheet and kept that time in the spreadsheet and I tracked very very diligently every day one because I had to I mean it was part of my job but then you know a little bit of obsessive compulsively I I kept it beyond that time uh because I wanted to know I wanted to really know how much time things took me to do and one thing that I realized was that top things always took me longer to start with than I thought I would do and and I always wanted them to be done faster than I had done them and uh and that's because over time uh you know we've just learned through several studies that the younger brain uh has more impulsivity and so therefore time is distorted we get to kind of middle age-ish um and you know those Center years uh before we get into more older years and we have a less distorted sense of time and then that time gets a little bit more distorted as we get to get to the end of our our you know golden years so to speak um and so like at different times in your life time moves differently right like your brain just thinks of time differently so in this particular period of time in your life you need to figure out what time means to you and is that a resource that is physical and tangible or is it something that is is a flow of something right we're talking about sequencing just before we're thinking about project and task sequencing if if time the individual units of minutes and hours don't really matter so much to you but more the blocks of work that need to get done then it doesn't really matter for you to worry about the the incremental time moving forward more the outcomes of those particular goals and there's people are different about those things and I have to decide that I'm a minutes and hours counter like I during my weekly review I have to set up my unschedule see how much time I have available to me I need to master how much time I've budgeted two things and then to manifest those at the end of the day to know that I've been quote unquote successful in my own day for other folks it's like I've got two projects that I want to accomplish today they accomplish them and they're happy with their life totally cool totally comfortable with that being your definition of success it's not mine and that's not my life to live so why should I why should it matter to me right um and so that I think is the piece that I think a lot of people miss I know that also what charnis is saying about tracking your time is good for both of those people though the people who don't care about the time signature right the seconds and minutes and hours passing by still need to know how much time things take so they're even able to think okay well I may not be able to get three projects done today but I could get two projects done today in this in the grand scheme of things I have two blocks in my day that I know I'm going to really be able to concentrate on things and I'll be able to get those things done and it's kind of like two Services you know in a restaurant right like I could do two services in a day great that's what time we block for it and let's let's sequence all of the tasks to make that thing happen and I feel like that's really important for people to kind of dwell on I think there's a third group of people that you left out right and that's the group who don't have a clue it's not that they don't care and they can just do it it's that like for me I plan my week and I always over plan like there's no way I could do all the projects I put on my plate for a week and I do it over and over like the insane definition thinking that it's going to give me a different outcome and I continue to do it because I still do not get how long it actually takes and that it's not so much how much time the things take is it putting in the buffer time like if I go to plan out if I go to unschedule I'm jamming myself packed full which is not going to happen it's unrealistic because for me energy is more of a uh issued in time like I have time it's that I don't have the energy to necessarily do everything I think I should be able to when I was 21 I could do the I I could do the amount of work that in my mind I think I can do now and and I only did it for three years and then I was crashed because it was like you know non-stop working from Dust to Dawn or past way past and um but see I still have that idea of like oh you know so over packing and not having so I think there's a group of people who just don't get like the reality of the situation is and so there needs to be some kind of way of figuring that out and I'm hoping that this book's going to help me do that because because I wish I could be that person who says oh yeah I don't care what time it is I have two projects to do and I'll do them and they get done or even be like you and be like yeah I'm gonna count the time and it's gonna work but no matter how many times I've tried different things it's not changing the reality of that I over stuff my schedule and and that leads to overwhelm and then you know how much gets done when you're like oh God I have all this to do you know absolutely yeah yeah calculating yeah and calculating buffer time for example is something that I've done for years and years and the more I accurately predict buffer time the less likely I am to have a car crash on the Super Highway of my task lists right and it's it's inevitable if I have the right amount of downtime in my day then I know that when I speed up when I accelerate to where I need to be to get all the things done then cars are in are going by everything's happening you know the moment I don't have enough buffer time is the moment I lose concentration and then there's a car wreck right and it's like man how did that happen and it's inevitable that the thing that I find is that I didn't have enough time to switch between tasks appropriately right that that that concept of um you know choosing to kind of segue from one project to the next and so you just aren't paying attention lower quality all those things or you get overwhelmed and you're like uh you know like I don't want to do any of these things now on my list that are in front of me I could do all of them I just don't want to and you feel that sense of of apathy or immediate contradictory kind of like anti-authoritarian perspective where you're like no and you and you Rebel and of course you know the answer or the antidote that charnis talks about when we're clean of course is motion right just getting into action is better than inaction and uh and that definitely has helped me over the years is just knowing that yeah I know I don't want to do any of these things but if I do any of these things it'll be better than doing none of these things and sitting here and you know moping uh so it's been it's been useful for me in that sense as well any other parts of the principles you want to talk about well just so you're just talking about the he has in there a checklist for transitioning too to like clear your space and I really I was like that's really cool because then it builds in that buffer time of transition yeah like I like the fact that he was like have a have a spray bottle and a cloth to clean spaces and it doesn't have to actually be like you're not actually cleaning for sanitary purposes but it it's like that physical representation of the fact that you're you're always cleaning but you're you're transitioning between pieces of of your mental life or your day right you're physically wiping your face has the same like yeah actually closing windows that you don't need for the next meeting on your computer it's easier to find the windows you do need you know you need those three or four open so close the other 17. that was the one spot in the book where I was like oh I do that it was the one thing I was like okay yes I am so clean about that I mean if you have more than one tablet where I'm like what's wrong with you why do you have another tab on them I'm very anal about that but everything else now oh I always have dozens of tabs open uh and I I'm in my in my closing routine at the end of the day my work day routine is to is to basically take any ones that I need and bookmark them and then close them out and I reuse tabs and so I will frequently go through the history of my uh my browser to make sure that I haven't over written something that I do need for the future you know just research that kind of things and many times I've come across you know some resource that I know and the feature a client will need or a colleague will ask me about and so I'll save those things for feature reference and I don't particularly have time during the day to deal with those things and this book always encourages me to maybe make that time when I'm transitioning and so I'm going to try that a little bit coming out of this is to see if if it actually does save me time and energy because really the the review process at the end of my day is helpful for me to remember the various resources that I've come across in my day and I feel like if I clean it at that moment then it's it's gone like I won't remember that I had it and yeah I could search Evernote because that's where everything goes but you know like I can't always depend upon the hierarchy and even search to find everything that I touched just in a random moment you know in my day thinking oh yeah you know what my this person may need this at some point you know that that potentiality doesn't like uh dwell on my brain right it's just yeah it's possible that something that will be useful and these apps today you know and resources they all have these crazy names and so you know I have no idea how to find something after the fact without having to type all of the code the all of the keywords and tagging it appropriately and I know I won't do that if I do that in the moment but if I do that during my work day closing routine then I'll spend the time to say okay I better put these terms in it because then when I go to search for it later I'll actually find it as opposed to some gobbledygook name that doesn't mean anything and of course they haven't done proper keyword indexing for their website so when the bookmark gets captured it doesn't have the right description and you know those images don't tell me anything either because sometimes you know Evernote will capture like and display an image that has nothing to do with the actual website itself it's like some icon on the page that it picks up so I'm always like no no I want I want to I want to control that piece so that I am able to find it Well in the future yeah really great great point and um in the past I think kind of like Linda over time we've sort of learned uh missed opportunities I'm gonna say that Loosely um so one of the things I've gotten better at doing recently is to keep stickies open uh at least one sticky open on the well I have an app it's a computer so keep it open on the desktop and as these side extraneous thoughts come to mind just jot it down as a placeholder so I don't forget and then by the end of the day you know or when there's a uh break in my schedule then I go back and look at those and then finish tying up the Loose Ends because otherwise what I find is if I go tie up the Loose Ends right then uh either put it on another action list or bookmark it or whatever then I'm off on a rabbit Trail and then it's harder to get back so that that has worked for me yeah for me yeah the little Evernote helper on Windows Control Alt H oh my gosh it's like the digital equivalent of the memo pad by the phone you know a thought occurs just hit that you type it in Click somewhere it goes away and it holds it and then you know later in the day look at all those thoughts and put them where they need to go yeah something something also that comes to mind there is it's a good metric to see what you capture like what you were just talking about Usha and what you're talking about Frank is that if you see yourself capturing and you're not able to basically deal with the clarifying and organizing a lot of GTD but really you know like processing those items into something meaningful then there may be some over capturing involved uh there may just be not enough clarifying and organizing time like it tells us a lot when you start to see things overflowing that where's the hiccup in the system are you are is there a diligence issue where you do need to spend some more time focused on the organization of your system and that's a daily thing not a not a weekly thing perhaps so that you can do that in piecemeal and therefore have less overwhelm when it comes to dealing with those pieces but it could also be that just it's a busy period of time and there's just going to be stuff that is a little bit more chaotic and I I I like that about the book you know where he talks about the idea that chefs are in a chaotic environment and they're doing this work so that when they're in the chaotic environment they have some semblance of control over their environment so they're able to put out high quality work and that definitely like makes me think of my own days where you know clients are calling and emailing and things are going on and those can be very stressful for me but I know that I've set the stage I've kind of I've put everything in its place so that I'm able to make sure that I'm still being productive withstanding all of the potential chaos around me all right we are running out of time and so I wanted to just see if anybody had any final uh thoughts before we closed out and uh and I'd be curious in the chat if you want to put whether or not you would recommend the book or not and so uh go ahead and throw in the chat if Hebrew recommend the book or not and any anyone with any final thoughts major questions burning desires No Good Wonderful uh we've got a we've got uh several highly recommend one of the best books you've read lately that's great Usha wonderful wonderful wonderful I'm so glad everybody enjoyed this book and I I really I recommend it highly like I said it's in my it's in my top 10 now and I

                "content": "there's a term in cooking called Mezen plus which is something that I learned almost a year ago I attended the bend design conference which is a fantastic design conference by the way and I listened to Lynette Xander's give a presentation on momentum and creating momentum in your life and Mazin plus is a cooking terminology that comes from I think the French language and it stands for or what it's more of a concept or a theory that you set out all of the ingredients you chop the potatoes you peel all the carrots everything you need to do and you get all of your ingredients measured in bowls and laid out on the counter so when you start cooking it's very effortless and you can do it very quickly and focus more on the craft of cooking instead of like running around the kitchen and trying to prepare all these things while the soups burning and you're doing all this stuff so it's a that's the concept but Lynette Sanders took this concept I don't know if she was the first one to do this or not but she put it into the business and tried to it not business but your life and she talked about trying to set up your life in a way and your workspace in a way that was this mizzen plus theory or approach so I have I'm not necessarily notoriously a messy person but I did make an effort yesterday to really eliminate a lot of the distraction in my office so I'm going to just give you a quick tour but my office is just I won't give you a tour of my house but you come in the door of my office here and I just moved the desk around which for right now is just a folding table because that's cheap and effective and I also cleaned up my bookshelf over here which I'm going to be using as the backdrop as I record more of these videos I also placed on the wall here this is another shout out to Lynette who helped us craft our sky brief which I can probably address at a later point but she does a great job with creating briefs and then my desk here I have tried to remove essentially all clutter except stuff that I use on a regular basis so I've got the iMac that I typically work on and then I sometimes will have two screens another one on my laptop I have a notepad and a water bottle and then to be honest I probably could get rid of some of that clutter in the corner but it's a substantial upgrade from what I had before and then over here by the door those things will be out of our office shortly there's a Mac an iMac in there that I'm sending back to our creative director in Minnesota who just moved and then this stuff I am selling on Craigslist so quick plug if you're looking for a the printers not going but a little coffee table or a miniature entertainment center I'm practically just going to give them to anyone that wants them online so I can get it out of here and then over here on the wall I put some books that I find I've read these and really like them scaling up is a book by Vern Harnish who started the entrepreneurs organization and another book that I recently read is Daymond John's power of broke which is a fantastic book that I relate a lot to as at this point in my career because I feel like I'm broke oftentimes but anyways that's my office and the other thing that I have implemented are attempting to do on a regular basis is the night before setting out my game plan for what I'm going to do the following day so right when I wake up I sit down and just jump into work instead of waking up and then spending the first hour of my day kind of contemplating what is important in going through emails I'm trying to get all that done the night before so I can wake up go work out eat breakfast and then jump right into work so that is how I am attempting to apply Mazin plops into my business and my life to hopefully become a little more effective and efficient and also give me more energy in the day as working so I don't know if you guys ever heard this before but I'd be curious to know do you have any other strategies or things that you're doing on a regular basis shoot me an email leave me a comment and let me know what you guys think",

sketch board 00:00:34.640 that i neatly made for you so you can 00:00:36.160 visualize all these main concepts 00:00:38.640 i made some flash cards for you which is 00:00:40.960 what the book recommends so 00:00:42.640 i made flashcards for the book that 00:00:44.399 recommends flashcards for better 00:00:46.000 learning 00:00:47.440 all right so let's dive into my sketch 00:00:52.320 right here and i actually got this idea 00:00:53.920 of making sketches for the concepts that 00:00:55.920 i learned 00:00:56.719 out of this book the sketchnote handbook 00:00:59.760 highly recommended 00:01:02.800 what's in it for me is that i'm in this 00:01:04.959 journey of life and i want to be 00:01:06.799 i'm a learner for life and i want to 00:01:09.200 achieve mastery 00:01:10.560 in the most efficient way so really 00:01:13.680 sharpening my saw 00:01:15.040 and studying how to better learn is one 00:01:18.240 of the 00:01:18.560 first building blocks that we should all 00:01:20.320 do before we 00:01:21.759 take on a journey of trying to read 00:01:23.840 multiple books or 00:01:25.520 we all i mean most people a lot of 00:01:27.040 people have goals as how many books they 00:01:28.479 want to read weekly or annually 00:01:30.400 and if you really sharpen your saw 00:01:32.640 you're going to be able to retain that 00:01:33.840 information better 00:01:35.200 so this is how all right so 00:01:38.880 here we go 00:01:42.000 just follow the red pen that i'm going 00:01:44.479 to narrate and just follow that pattern 00:01:45.920 and you'll you'll be able to follow 00:01:46.960 along 00:01:48.079 one of the main concepts is that you 00:01:49.439 want to build on previous knowledge 00:01:52.159 so you got this stack of cubes here on 00:01:54.399 the right 00:01:55.280 and let's say that you know a basic math 00:01:57.520 concept 00:01:58.640 whenever you learn new concept in math 00:02:01.280 maybe you 00:02:02.079 somehow tie it and build upon the 00:02:04.719 previous knowledge 00:02:06.000 so you're anchoring that knowledge and 00:02:08.959 that's 00:02:09.280 your brain makes the connections and you 00:02:10.878 can build on it and if you continue the 00:02:13.040 process 00:02:14.160 you can reach infinite learning 00:02:15.920 according to the book 00:02:17.360 see i made the infinite little dots an 00:02:19.760 infinite sign 00:02:21.520 i thought that was pretty cool 00:02:24.640 learning should be hard and challenging 00:02:26.560 connections are being made in your mind 00:02:28.800 so when you encounter obstacles and it 00:02:30.560 takes a hard time for the answer to come 00:02:32.560 up 00:02:33.440 it's a good thing so you're on the right 00:02:35.680 track if that happens 00:02:38.080 by the way the the term is called 00:02:39.519 elaborate learning of this building 00:02:41.280 blocks 00:02:44.319 what do you do if you want to learn and 00:02:47.440 study for a long time long periods of 00:02:49.280 time but you feel like you're burning 00:02:51.120 out 00:02:51.840 you you read a page you don't even 00:02:53.760 remember what you just read 00:02:55.440 you're going through the videos for your 00:02:56.800 classes you can't really listen to the 00:02:58.720 professor 00:03:00.000 what do you do the answer is you want to 00:03:02.159 interleave that's the word 00:03:03.760 interleave subjects so here i have a 00:03:06.000 visual for this 00:03:06.800 there are three main subjects that study 00:03:08.239 right now are calculus mechanical design 00:03:10.000 and physics 00:03:11.519 another reason other than wanting to 00:03:13.840 stay awake and more receptive to the 00:03:15.360 information 00:03:16.239 is that when you interleave the subjects 00:03:19.599 your subconscious mind is still active 00:03:22.400 so if you're studying calculus 00:03:24.239 and you switch to mechanical design 00:03:26.080 mechanical design means 00:03:27.680 gears and building things mechanisms 00:03:30.000 that's what it means 00:03:32.720 the calculus is going to be in the back 00:03:34.720 your mind still working 00:03:36.720 and also according to research the book 00:03:39.680 is 00:03:40.080 several pages long and there's several 00:03:42.560 studies that are cited 00:03:43.840 the research shows that you should 00:03:45.920 switch subjects 00:03:48.080 whenever you're feeling the hang of it 00:03:49.680 when you're just about to get it 00:03:51.599 you snap your finger you switch the 00:03:53.200 subject this seems 00:03:54.640 totally counterintuitive it seems 00:03:57.439 disruptive 00:03:58.480 i totally understand but their research 00:04:00.560 shows that is the best way to attain new 00:04:02.959 knowledge 00:04:04.319 so that's a technique that i've been 00:04:05.760 implementing and it works so you want to 00:04:07.360 interleave 00:04:08.000 two or more subjects that also gives you 00:04:10.319 a lot more stamina 00:04:12.400 keeps your mind fresh so that's why i 00:04:14.400 drew this visual here 00:04:15.840 of me here with the glasses reading a 00:04:18.320 calculus book 00:04:19.680 going to the physics book then going to 00:04:21.759 the mechanical design book or lectures 00:04:23.680 or 00:04:24.000 studying and i made a track i used to 00:04:26.400 run track 00:04:28.000 broke the mile record by the way i used 00:04:29.680 to run track so i put at 24 hours 00:04:32.080 you just keep on running like the 00:04:33.440 energizer bunny and you're not getting 00:04:35.280 tired 00:04:36.080 so interleave the subjects do not get 00:04:38.639 tired 00:04:39.280 and absorb the information better 00:04:42.800 now we're going to come across probably 00:04:45.360 the main theme of the book 00:04:46.880 which is spaced repetition and utilizing 00:04:49.919 flashcards 00:04:51.360 that's the key the key is that it should 00:04:53.199 be hard guys 00:04:54.560 you should really be uh the information 00:04:57.280 should not be 00:04:58.560 mindlessly being repeated when you go 00:05:00.880 flash you see this a lot with college 00:05:02.400 students 00:05:03.280 and no one has taught you this before so 00:05:05.039 hopefully you watching this video now 00:05:06.560 you're learning this 00:05:07.520 and i thought this was pretty insightful 00:05:09.360 there's a the right way of doing 00:05:11.039 flashcards 00:05:12.240 should not be mindless and i got this 00:05:14.560 little guy drooling here 00:05:16.960 you should not just be mindlessly going 00:05:18.479 to flashcards in a quick fashion 00:05:21.280 you should be you should be stuck 00:05:23.199 sometimes as you go through a flashcard 00:05:24.720 you should have 00:05:25.360 three stacks of flashcards and my 00:05:28.800 favorite technique is to have assigned 00:05:31.440 colors 00:05:32.479 for the background and flashcard because 00:05:34.080 i use google slides 00:05:36.320 for the flashcards that i made which are 00:05:38.560 in the description of this video 00:05:40.160 like for instance this one i put a 00:05:42.639 background of orange 00:05:44.080 you may ask why well the background 00:05:46.639 signifies how often 00:05:48.400 i should study that flash card because 00:05:50.960 it determines if i knew the flash card 00:05:52.720 if not 00:05:53.199 if i struggle with it so a red flash 00:05:55.440 card 00:05:56.240 means that i didn't get the right answer 00:05:58.080 so i should study that daily 00:06:00.160 an orange flash card is every other day 00:06:02.080 and then white monthly 00:06:05.440 and you can see this concept in the 00:06:06.960 illustration here on the right 00:06:09.840 and the book says that you want to space 00:06:12.880 out your learning 00:06:14.000 if you do all your learning if you cram 00:06:15.919 it yes yes yes yes yes every day you're 00:06:18.639 studying the same flash cards 00:06:20.479 you're not going to make it very far you 00:06:22.240 want to do what's called space 00:06:23.520 repetition that i mentioned before 00:06:25.280 you're going to make it farther you're 00:06:26.560 going to make it to the top of the hill 00:06:28.800 where you're going to find the ferrari 00:06:30.240 the mansion enlightenment 00:06:31.919 all the things you want if you have 00:06:34.720 space repetition 00:06:36.080 you're going to make it farther you're 00:06:37.199 going to remember things better when you 00:06:39.199 do this 00:06:40.639 so i put the turtle here as an analogy 00:06:43.440 to take your time 00:06:44.880 uh it may seem counter-intuitive to not 00:06:47.840 study the same thing every day 00:06:49.680 but you want to switch yes no yes no and 00:06:52.720 that's 00:06:53.199 how you're going to make it the farther 00:06:54.400 by the way that's my instagram name feel 00:06:56.160 free to add me 00:06:59.280 when should you study the best time to 00:07:01.599 study this is a really cool technique 00:07:04.240 is right after your lecture or the video 00:07:07.039 or the book that you just finished 00:07:09.199 stop and for 10 minutes take out a blank 00:07:12.400 sheet of paper 00:07:13.520 and write down everything you remember 00:07:15.680 for the first two minutes 00:07:17.520 you're gonna flow you're just gonna keep 00:07:18.880 on writing and writing but when you get 00:07:20.800 around the two-minute mark 00:07:22.400 you're gonna find out that you run out 00:07:24.479 of things to write down 00:07:25.840 you're just not gonna remember anymore 00:07:27.680 but hang in there 00:07:29.599 push through the discomfort because 00:07:31.360 around minute three and four 00:07:33.360 more things will start coming to you 00:07:34.800 you'll continue to fill the page 00:07:36.880 when it comes to the 10 minute mark look 00:07:39.599 there's a little eye 00:07:40.880 look at what you wrote and then compare 00:07:43.599 it to your class notes 00:07:45.199 and see where the gaps in your knowledge 00:07:47.680 and those are the things you need to 00:07:49.440 study and focus more on 00:07:51.520 you also want to reflect and try to 00:07:54.639 pinpoint the biggest topics and concepts 00:07:57.360 that were shared 00:07:58.080 in the lecture or in the video that you 00:08:00.000 watch and you want to relate it 00:08:02.960 and build it and ask yourself how does 00:08:05.680 this build and why you're right now 00:08:08.800 come back to the pyramid here in essence 00:08:11.599 that's the summary 00:08:12.879 of the book these were my first notes 00:08:16.800 so i'm not as tidy as you may think so i 00:08:20.000 translated this onto the right 00:08:21.759 it looks much better as you can see and 00:08:24.240 the flash cards are free 00:08:25.759 they're google slides so both android 00:08:28.639 and 00:08:28.879 apple devices have this in free app and 00:08:31.759 the queue 00:08:32.479 on the top left signifies a question and 00:08:34.958 the a signifies an answer 00:08:37.200 so link is in the description below you 00:08:38.880 can flip through the flashcards 00:08:40.719 and quiz yourself thank you for watching 00:08:43.360 if you enjoyed this video like

00:00:00.480 today i'll be doing a summary of my 00:00:01.920 favorite book of all time you heard that 00:00:03.679 right 00:00:04.000 my favorite book number one of all time 00:00:06.960 and it's called 00:00:07.600 make it stick the science of successful 00:00:10.160 learning my name is rafael testai 00:00:12.480 why is this book my number one book of 00:00:14.160 all time because it teaches you 00:00:16.400 how to learn and extract and retain the 00:00:19.279 information 00:00:20.240 from all the subsequent classes and 00:00:22.480 books you'll read after this one 00:00:24.400 it teaches

but you feel like you're burning 00:02:51.120 out 00:02:51.840 you you read a page you don't even 00:02:53.760 remember what you just read 00:02:55.440 you're going through the videos for your

00:03:57.439 disruptive 00:03:58.480 i totally understand but their research 00:04:00.560 shows that is the best way to attain new 00:04:02.959 knowledge 00:04:04.319 so that's a technique that i've been 00:04:05.760 implementing and it works so you want to 00:04:07.360 interleave 00:04:08.000 two or more subjects that also gives you 00:04:10.319 a lot more stamina 00:04:12.400 keeps your mind fresh so that's why i 00:04:14.400 drew this visual here 00:04:15.840 of me here with the glasses reading a 00:04:18.320 calculus book 00:04:19.680 going to the physics book then going to 00:04:21.759 the mechanical design book or lectures 00:04:23.680 or 00:04:24.000 studying and i made a track i used to 00:04:26.400 run track 00:04:28.000 broke the mile record by the way i used 00:04:29.680 to run track so i put at 24 hours 00:04:32.080 you just keep on running like the 00:04:33.440 energizer bunny and you're not getting 00:04:35.280 tired 00:04:36.080 so interleave the subjects do not get 00:04:38.639 tired 00:04:39.280 and absorb the information better 00:04:42.800 now we're going to come across probably 00:04:45.360 the main theme of the book 00:04:46.880 which is spaced repetition and utilizing 00:04:49.919 flashcards 00:04:51.360 that's the key the key is that it should 00:04:53.199 be hard guys 00:04:54.560 you should really be uh the information 00:04:57.280 should not be 00:04:58.560 mindlessly being repeated when you go 00:05:00.880 flash you see this a lot with college 00:05:02.400 students 00:05:03.280 and no one has taught you this before so 00:05:05.039 hopefully you watching this video now 00:05:06.560 you're learning this 00:05:07.520 and i thought this was pretty insightful 00:05:09.360 there's a the right way of doing 00:05:11.039 flashcards 00:05:12.240 should not be mindless and i got this 00:05:14.560 little guy drooling here 00:05:16.960 you should not just be mindlessly going 00:05:18.479 to flashcards in a quick fashion 00:05:21.280 you should be you should be stuck 00:05:23.199 sometimes as you go through a flashcard 00:05:24.720 you should have 00:05:25.360 three stacks of flashcards and my 00:05:28.800 favorite technique is to have assigned 00:05:31.440 colors 00:05:32.479 for the background and flashcard because 00:05:34.080 i use google slides 00:05:36.320 for the flashcards that i made which are 00:05:38.560 in the description of this video 00:05:40.160 like for instance this one i put a 00:05:42.639 background of orange 00:05:44.080 you may ask why well the background 00:05:46.639 signifies how often 00:05:48.400 i should study that flash card because 00:05:50.960 it determines if i knew the flash card 00:05:52.720 if not 00:05:53.199 if i struggle with it so a red flash 00:05:55.440 card 00:05:56.240 means that i didn't get the right answer 00:05:58.080 so i should study that daily 00:06:00.160 an orange flash card is every other day 00:06:02.080 and then white monthly 00:06:05.440 and you can see this concept in the 00:06:06.960 illustration here on the right 00:06:09.840 and the book says that you want to space 00:06:12.880 out your learning 00:06:14.000 if you do all your learning if you cram 00:06:15.919 it yes yes yes yes yes every day you're 00:06:18.639 studying the same flash cards 00:06:20.479 you're not going to make it very far you 00:06:22.240 want to do what's called space 00:06:23.520 repetition that i mentioned before 00:06:25.280 you're going to make it farther you're 00:06:26.560 going to make it to the top of the hill 00:06:28.800 where you're going to find the ferrari 00:06:30.240 the mansion enlightenment 00:06:31.919 all the things you want if you have 00:06:34.720 space repetition 00:06:36.080 you're going to make it farther you're 00:06:37.199 going to remember things better when you 00:06:39.199 do this 00:06:40.639 so i put the turtle here as an analogy 00:06:43.440 to take your time 00:06:44.880 uh it may seem counter-intuitive to not 00:06:47.840 study the same thing every day 00:06:49.680 but you want to switch yes no yes no and 00:06:52.720 that's 00:06:53.199 how you're going to make it the farther 00:06:54.400 by the way that's my instagram name feel 00:06:56.160 free to add me 00:06:59.280 when should you study the best time to 00:07:01.599 study this is a really cool technique 00:07:04.240 is right after your lecture or the video 00:07:07.039 or the book that you just finished 00:07:09.199 stop and for 10 minutes take out a blank 00:07:12.400 sheet of paper 00:07:13.520 and write down everything you remember 00:07:15.680 for the first two minutes 00:07:17.520 you're gonna flow you're just gonna keep 00:07:18.880 on writing and writing but when you get 00:07:20.800 around the two-minute mark 00:07:22.400 you're gonna find out that you run out 00:07:24.479 of things to write down 00:07:25.840 you're just not gonna remember anymore 00:07:27.680 but hang in there 00:07:29.599 push through the discomfort because 00:07:31.360 around minute three and four 00:07:33.360 more things will start coming to you 00:07:34.800 you'll continue to fill the page 00:07:36.880 when it comes to the 10 minute mark look 00:07:39.599 there's a little eye 00:07:40.880 look at what you wrote and then compare 00:07:43.599 it to your class notes 00:07:45.199 and see where the gaps in your knowledge 00:07:47.680 and those are the things you need to 00:07:49.440 study and focus more on 00:07:51.520 you also want to reflect and try to 00:07:54.639 pinpoint the biggest topics and concepts 00:07:57.360 that were shared 00:07:58.080 in the lecture or in the video that you 00:08:00.000 watch and you want to relate it 00:08:02.960 and build it and ask yourself how does 00:08:05.680 this build and why you're right now 00:08:08.800 come back to the pyramid here in essence 00:08:11.599 that's the summary 00:08:12.879 of the book these were my first notes 00:08:16.800 so i'm not as tidy as you may think so i 00:08:20.000 translated this onto the right 00:08:21.759 it looks much better as you can see and 00:08:24.240 the flash cards are free 00:08:25.759 they're google slides so both android 00:08:28.639 and 00:08:28.879 apple devices have this in free app and 00:08:31.759 the queue 00:08:32.479 on the top left signifies a question and 00:08:34.958 the a signifies an answer 00:08:37.200 so link is in the description below you 00:08:38.880 can flip through the flashcards 00:08:40.719 and quiz yourself thank you for watching 00:08:43.360 if you enjoyed this video like

00:00:00.480 today i'll be doing a summary of my 00:00:01.920 favorite book of all time you heard that 00:00:03.679 right 00:00:04.000 my favorite book number one of all time 00:00:06.960 and it's called 00:00:07.600 make it stick the science of successful 00:00:10.160 learning my name is rafael testai 00:00:12.480 why is this book my number one book of 00:00:14.160 all time because it teaches you 00:00:16.400 how to learn and extract and retain the 00:00:19.279 information 00:00:20.240 from all the subsequent classes and 00:00:22.480 books you'll read after this one 00:00:24.400 it teaches you study techniques how to 00:00:26.560 not trick yourself to thinking that you 00:00:28.080 know something when you don't and 00:00:30.560 several things i'm going to go over i 00:00:32.558 have a sketch board 00:00:34.640 that i neatly made for you so you can 00:00:36.160 visualize all these main concepts 00:00:38.640 i made some flash cards for you which is 00:00:40.960 what the book recommends so 00:00:42.640 i made flashcards for the book that 00:00:44.399 recommends flashcards for better 00:00:46.000 learning 00:00:47.440 all right so let's dive into my sketch 00:00:52.320 right here and i actually got this idea 00:00:53.920 of making sketches for the concepts that 00:00:55.920 i learned 00:00:56.719 out of this book the sketchnote handbook 00:00:59.760 highly recommended 00:01:02.800 what's in it for me is that i'm in this 00:01:04.959 journey of life and i want to be 00:01:06.799 i'm a learner for life and i want to 00:01:09.200 achieve mastery 00:01:10.560 in the most efficient way so really 00:01:13.680 sharpening my saw 00:01:15.040 and studying how to better learn is one 00:01:18.240 of the 00:01:18.560 first building blocks that we should all 00:01:20.320 do before we 00:01:21.759 take on a journey of trying to read 00:01:23.840 multiple books or 00:01:25.520 we all i mean most people a lot of 00:01:27.040 people have goals as how many books they 00:01:28.479 want to read weekly or annually 00:01:30.400 and if you really sharpen your saw 00:01:32.640 you're going to be able to retain that 00:01:33.840 information better 00:01:35.200 so this is how all right so 00:01:38.880 here we go 00:01:42.000 just follow the red pen that i'm going 00:01:44.479 to narrate and just follow that pattern 00:01:45.920 and you'll you'll be able to follow 00:01:46.960 along 00:01:48.079 one of the main concepts is that you 00:01:49.439 want to build on previous knowledge 00:01:52.159 so you got this stack of cubes here on 00:01:54.399 the right 00:01:55.280 and let's say that you know a basic math 00:01:57.520 concept 00:01:58.640 whenever you learn new concept in math 00:02:01.280 maybe you 00:02:02.079 somehow tie it and build upon the 00:02:04.719 previous knowledge 00:02:06.000 so you're anchoring that knowledge and 00:02:08.959 that's 00:02:09.280 your brain makes the connections and you 00:02:10.878 can build on it and if you continue the 00:02:13.040 process 00:02:14.160 you can reach infinite learning 00:02:15.920 according to the book 00:02:17.360 see i made the infinite little dots an 00:02:19.760 infinite sign 00:02:21.520 i thought that was pretty cool 00:02:24.640 learning should be hard and challenging 00:02:26.560 connections are being made in your mind 00:02:28.800 so when you encounter obstacles and it 00:02:30.560 takes a hard time for the answer to come 00:02:32.560 up 00:02:33.440 it's a good thing so you're on the right 00:02:35.680 track if that happens 00:02:38.080 by the way the the term is called 00:02:39.519 elaborate learning of this building 00:02:41.280 blocks 00:02:44.319 what do you do if you want to learn and 00:02:47.440 study for a long time long periods of 00:02:49.280 time but you feel like you're burning 00:02:51.120 out 00:02:51.840 you you read a page you don't even 00:02:53.760 remember what you just read 00:02:55.440 you're going through the videos for your 00:02:56.800 classes you can't really listen to the 00:02:58.720 professor 00:03:00.000 what do you do the answer is you want to 00:03:02.159 interleave that's the word 00:03:03.760 interleave subjects so here i have a 00:03:06.000 visual for this 00:03:06.800 there are three main subjects that study 00:03:08.239 right now are calculus mechanical design 00:03:10.000 and physics 00:03:11.519 another reason other than wanting to 00:03:13.840 stay awake and more receptive to the 00:03:15.360 information 00:03:16.239 is that when you interleave the subjects 00:03:19.599 your subconscious mind is still active 00:03:22.400 so if you're studying calculus 00:03:24.239 and you switch to mechanical design 00:03:26.080 mechanical design means 00:03:27.680 gears and building things mechanisms 00:03:30.000 that's what it means 00:03:32.720 the calculus is going to be in the back 00:03:34.720 your mind still working 00:03:36.720 and also according to research the book 00:03:39.680 is 00:03:40.080 several pages long and there's several 00:03:42.560 studies that are cited 00:03:43.840 the research shows that you should 00:03:45.920 switch subjects 00:03:48.080 whenever you're feeling the hang of it 00:03:49.680 when you're just about to get it 00:03:51.599 you snap your finger you switch the 00:03:53.200 subject this seems 00:03:54.640 totally counterintuitive it seems 00:03:57.439 disruptive 00:03:58.480 i totally understand but their research 00:04:00.560 shows that is the best way to attain new 00:04:02.959 knowledge 00:04:04.319 so that's a technique that i've been 00:04:05.760 implementing and it works so you want to 00:04:07.360 interleave 00:04:08.000 two or more subjects that also gives you 00:04:10.319 a lot more stamina 00:04:12.400 keeps your mind fresh so that's why i 00:04:14.400 drew this visual here 00:04:15.840 of me here with the glasses reading a 00:04:18.320 calculus book 00:04:19.680 going to the physics book then going to 00:04:21.759 the mechanical design book or lectures 00:04:23.680 or 00:04:24.000 studying and i made a track i used to 00:04:26.400 run track 00:04:28.000 broke the mile record by the way i used 00:04:29.680 to run track so i put at 24 hours 00:04:32.080 you just keep on running like the 00:04:33.440 energizer bunny and you're not getting 00:04:35.280 tired 00:04:36.080 so interleave the subjects do not get 00:04:38.639 tired 00:04:39.280 and absorb the information better 00:04:42.800 now we're going to come across probably 00:04:45.360 the main theme of the book 00:04:46.880 which is spaced repetition

everything you remember 00:07:15.680 for the first two minutes 00:07:17.520 you're gonna flow you're just gonna keep 00:07:18.880 on writing and writing but when you get 00:07:20.800 around the two-minute mark 00:07:22.400 you're gonna find out that you run out 00:07:24.479 of things to write down 00:07:25.840 you're just not gonna remember anymore 00:07:27.680 but hang in there 00:07:29.599 push through the discomfort because 00:07:31.360 around minute three and four 00:07:33.360 more things will start coming to you 00:07:34.800 you'll continue to fill the page 00:07:36.880 when it comes to the 10 minute mark look 00:07:39.599 there's a little eye 00:07:40.880 look at what you wrote and then compare 00:07:43.599 it to your class notes 00:07:45.199 and see where the gaps in your knowledge 00:07:47.680 and those are the things you need to 00:07:49.440 study and focus more on 00:07:51.520 you also want to reflect and try to 00:07:54.639 pinpoint the biggest topics and concepts 00:07:57.360 that were shared 00:07:58.080 in the lecture or in the video that you 00:08:00.000 watch and you want to relate it 00:08:02.960 and build it and ask yourself how does 00:08:05.680 this build and why you're right now 00:08:08.800 come back to the pyramid here in essence 00:08:11.599 that's the summary 00:08:12.879 of the book these were my first notes 00:08:16.800 so i'm not as tidy as you may think so i 00:08:20.000 translated this onto the right 00:08:21.759 it looks much better as you can see and 00:08:24.240 the flash cards are free 00:08:25.759 they're google slides so both android 00:08:28.639 and 00:08:28.879 apple devices have this in free app and 00:08:31.759 the queue 00:08:32.479 on the top left signifies a question and 00:08:34.958 the a signifies an answer 00:08:37.200 so link is in the description below you 00:08:38.880 can flip through the flashcards 00:08:40.719 and quiz yourself thank you for watching 00:08:43.360 if you enjoyed this video like

00:00:00.480 today i'll be doing a summary of my 00:00:01.920 favorite book of all time you heard that 00:00:03.679 right 00:00:04.000 my favorite book number one of all time 00:00:06.960 and it's called 00:00:07.600 make it stick the science of successful 00:00:10.160 learning my name is rafael testai 00:00:12.480 why is this book my number one book of 00:00:14.160 all time because it teaches you 00:00:16.400 how to learn and extract and retain the 00:00:19.279 information 00:00:20.240 from all the subsequent classes and 00:00:22.480 books you'll read after this one 00:00:24.400 it teaches you study techniques how to 00:00:26.560 not trick yourself to thinking that you 00:00:28.080 know something when you don't and 00:00:30.560 several things i'm going to go over i 00:00:32.558 have a sketch board 00:00:34.640 that i neatly made for you so you can 00:00:36.160 visualize all these main concepts 00:00:38.640 i made some flash cards for you which is 00:00:40.960 what the book recommends so 00:00:42.640 i made flashcards for the book that 00:00:44.399 recommends flashcards for better 00:00:46.000 learning 00:00:47.440 all right so let's dive into my sketch 00:00:52.320 right here and i actually got this idea 00:00:53.920 of making sketches for the concepts that 00:00:55.920 i learned 00:00:56.719 out of this book the sketchnote handbook 00:00:59.760 highly recommended 00:01:02.800 what's in it for me is that i'm in this 00:01:04.959 journey of life and i want to be 00:01:06.799 i'm a learner for life and i want to 00:01:09.200 achieve mastery 00:01:10.560 in the most efficient way so really 00:01:13.680 sharpening my saw 00:01:15.040 and studying how to better learn is one 00:01:18.240 of the 00:01:18.560 first building blocks that we should all 00:01:20.320 do before we 00:01:21.759 take on a journey of trying to read 00:01:23.840 multiple books or 00:01:25.520 we all i mean most people a lot of 00:01:27.040 people have goals as how many books they 00:01:28.479 want to read weekly or annually 00:01:30.400 and if you really sharpen your saw 00:01:32.640 you're going to be able to retain that 00:01:33.840 information better 00:01:35.200 so this is how all right so 00:01:38.880 here we go 00:01:42.000 just follow the red pen that i'm going 00:01:44.479 to narrate and just follow that pattern 00:01:45.920 and you'll you'll be able to follow 00:01:46.960 along 00:01:48.079 one of the main concepts is that you 00:01:49.439 want to build on previous knowledge 00:01:52.159 so you got this stack of cubes here on 00:01:54.399 the right 00:01:55.280 and let's say that you know a basic math 00:01:57.520 concept 00:01:58.640 whenever you learn new concept in math 00:02:01.280 maybe you 00:02:02.079 somehow tie it and build upon the 00:02:04.719 previous knowledge 00:02:06.000 so you're anchoring that knowledge and 00:02:08.959 that's 00:02:09.280 your brain makes the connections and you 00:02:10.878 can build on it and if you continue the 00:02:13.040 process 00:02:14.160 you can reach infinite learning 00:02:15.920 according to the book 00:02:17.360 see i made the infinite little dots an 00:02:19.760 infinite sign 00:02:21.520 i thought that was pretty cool 00:02:24.640 learning should be hard and challenging 00:02:26.560 connections are being made in your mind 00:02:28.800 so when you encounter obstacles and it 00:02:30.560 takes a hard time for the answer to come 00:02:32.560 up 00:02:33.440 it's a good thing so you're on the right 00:02:35.680 track if that happens 00:02:38.080 by the way the the term is called 00:02:39.519 elaborate learning of this building 00:02:41.280 blocks 00:02:44.319 what do you do if you want to learn and 00:02:47.440 study for a long time long periods of 00:02:49.280 time but you feel like you're burning 00:02:51.120 out 00:02:51.840 you you read a page you don't even 00:02:53.760 remember what you just read 00:02:55.440 you're going through the videos for your 00:02:56.800 classes you can't really listen to the 00:02:58.720 professor 00:03:00.000 what do you do the answer is you want to 00:03:02.159 interleave that's the word 00:03:03.760 interleave subjects so here i have a 00:03:06.000 visual for this 00:03:06.800 there are three main subjects that study 00:03:08.239 right now are calculus mechanical design 00:03:10.000 and physics 00:03:11.519 another reason other than wanting to 00:03:13.840 stay awake and more receptive to the 00:03:15.360 information 00:03:16.239 is that when you interleave the subjects 00:03:19.599 your subconscious mind is still active 00:03:22.400 so if you're studying calculus 00:03:24.239 and you switch to mechanical design 00:03:26.080 mechanical design means 00:03:27.680 gears and building things mechanisms 00:03:30.000 that's what it means 00:03:32.720 the calculus is going to be in the back 00:03:34.720 your mind still working 00:03:36.720 and also according to research the book 00:03:39.680 is 00:03:40.080 several pages long and there's several 00:03:42.560 studies that are cited 00:03:43.840 the research shows that you should 00:03:45.920 switch subjects 00:03:48.080 whenever you're feeling the hang of it 00:03:49.680 when you're just about to get it 00:03:51.599 you snap your finger you switch the 00:03:53.200 subject this seems 00:03:54.640 totally counterintuitive it seems 00:03:57.439 disruptive 00:03:58.480 i totally understand but their research 00:04:00.560 shows that is the best way to attain new 00:04:02.959 knowledge 00:04:04.319 so that's a technique that i've been 00:04:05.760 implementing and it works so you want to 00:04:07.360 interleave 00:04:08.000 two or more subjects that also gives you 00:04:10.319 a lot more stamina 00:04:12.400 keeps your mind fresh so that's why i 00:04:14.400 drew this visual here 00:04:15.840 of me here with the glasses reading a 00:04:18.320 calculus book 00:04:19.680 going to the physics book then going to 00:04:21.759 the mechanical design book or lectures 00:04:23.680 or 00:04:24.000 studying and i made a track i used to 00:04:26.400 run track 00:04:28.000 broke the mile record by the way i used 00:04:29.680 to run track so i put at 24 hours 00:04:32.080 you just keep on running like the 00:04:33.440 energizer bunny and you're not getting 00:04:35.280 tired 00:04:36.080 so interleave the subjects do not get 00:04:38.639 tired 00:04:39.280 and absorb the information better 00:04:42.800 now we're going to come across probably 00:04:45.360 the main theme of the book 00:04:46.880 which is spaced repetition and utilizing 00:04:49.919 flashcards 00:04:51.360 that's the key the key is that it should 00:04:53.199 be hard guys 00:04:54.560 you should really be uh the information 00:04:57.280 should not be 00:04:58.560 mindlessly being repeated when you go 00:05:00.880 flash you see this a lot with college 00:05:02.400 students 00:05:03.280 and no one has taught you this before so 00:05:05.039 hopefully you watching this video now 00:05:06.560 you're learning this 00:05:07.520 and i thought this was pretty insightful 00:05:09.360 there's a the right way of doing 00:05:11.039 flashcards 00:05:12.240 should not be mindless and i got this 00:05:14.560 little guy drooling here 00:05:16.960 you should not just be mindlessly going 00:05:18.479 to flashcards in a quick fashion 00:05:21.280 you should be you should be stuck 00:05:23.199 sometimes as you go through a flashcard 00:05:24.720 you should have 00:05:25.360 three stacks of flashcards and my 00:05:28.800 favorite technique is to have assigned 00:05:31.440 colors 00:05:32.479 for the background and flashcard because 00:05:34.080 i use google slides 00:05:36.320 for the flashcards that i made which are 00:05:38.560 in the description of this video 00:05:40.160 like for instance this one i put a 00:05:42.639 background of orange 00:05:44.080 you may ask why well the background 00:05:46.639 signifies how often 00:05:48.400 i should study that flash card because 00:05:50.960 it determines if i knew the flash card 00:05:52.720 if not 00:05:53.199 if i struggle with it so a red flash 00:05:55.440 card 00:05:56.240 means that i didn't get the right answer 00:05:58.080 so i should study that daily 00:06:00.160 an orange flash card is every other day 00:06:02.080 and then white monthly 00:06:05.440 and you can see this concept in the 00:06:06.960 illustration here on the right 00:06:09.840 and the book says that you want to space 00:06:12.880 out your learning 00:06:14.000 if you do all your learning if you cram 00:06:15.919 it yes yes yes yes yes every day you're 00:06:18.639 studying the same flash cards 00:06:20.479 you're not going to make it very far you 00:06:22.240 want to do what's called space 00:06:23.520 repetition that i mentioned before 00:06:25.280 you're going to make it farther you're 00:06:26.560 going to make it to the top of the hill 00:06:28.800 where you're going to find the ferrari 00:06:30.240 the mansion enlightenment 00:06:31.919 all the things you want if you have 00:06:34.720 space repetition 00:06:36.080 you're going to make it farther you're 00:06:37.199 going to remember things better when you 00:06:39.199 do this 00:06:40.639 so i put the turtle here as an analogy 00:06:43.440 to take your time 00:06:44.880 uh it may seem counter-intuitive to not 00:06:47.840 study the same thing every day 00:06:49.680 but you want to switch yes no yes no and 00:06:52.720 that's 00:06:53.199 how you're going to make it the farther 00:06:54.400 by the way that's my instagram name feel 00:06:56.160 free to add me 00:06:59.280 when should you study the best time to 00:07:01.599 study this is a really cool technique 00:07:04.240 is right after your lecture or the video 00:07:07.039 or the book that you just finished 00:07:09.199 stop and for 10 minutes take out a blank 00:07:12.400 sheet of paper 00:07:13.520 and write down

and welcome to verbal to visual 00:00:02.000 I'm Doug Neil and today we're going to 00:00:04.319 be talking about this book right here 00:00:06.960 make it stick the science of successful 00:00:09.599 learning this book came out about a 00:00:11.759 decade ago and has been on my reading 00:00:14.400 list for a while because even though I 00:00:17.160 went to school to become a teacher and 00:00:19.439 have been teaching and learning for much 00:00:23.039 of my life uh I've been wanting to have 00:00:26.000 you know kind of a a set of principles 00:00:28.439 based in science to influence how I 00:00:31.560 teach and also to reflect on the role 00:00:34.920 that the skill that I teach the skill of 00:00:37.719 sketching out ideas what that can play 00:00:40.520 in the learning process so what I would 00:00:42.840 like to do today is sketch out some of 00:00:44.879 my favorite ideas from that book and 00:00:48.399 reflect a little bit on what they have 00:00:50.160 to say about sketch noting I think the 00:00:52.680 main ideas from this book fall into 00:00:55.600 three categories that I'm going to 00:00:57.680 capture as a v diagram 00:01:08.240 and if we capture or incorporate all 00:01:11.960 three of these main ideas about 00:01:14.880 successful learning for the center of 00:01:17.520 this diagram that's where we will be 00:01:19.880 giving ourselves the best opportunity 00:01:22.079 that what we learn will actually stick 00:01:24.759 so I'll First share each of these three 00:01:26.920 main components and then we'll do a 00:01:28.920 little bit of a deep dive into each of 00:01:30.720 them the first of the three is that 00:01:33.439 sticky learning is about 00:01:36.560 retrieval not review so it's about 00:01:39.840 pulling ideas from memory as opposed to 00:01:45.079 just looking back at something like the 00:01:48.439 things you underlined in a book or your 00:01:50.560 highlights or rereading your bullet 00:01:53.119 point notes that type of rereading or 00:01:55.759 review isn't helpful in solidifying that 00:01:58.680 knowledge what's more more helpful is 00:02:01.560 prompting yourself with some question 00:02:03.799 and then having to pull that information 00:02:05.840 from memory the second overarching idea 00:02:08.679 is that your learning be 00:02:13.680 spaced and not crammed so here you 00:02:18.680 want a bit of separation between each 00:02:22.920 time you study uh a particular piece of 00:02:27.280 information or practice uh new 00:02:31.840 skill you want there to be a little bit 00:02:34.319 of time in between those practice 00:02:36.519 sessions because it's actually helpful 00:02:38.560 for you to forget a little bit or for it 00:02:41.440 to move kind of to a deeper part of your 00:02:43.840 brain so that it takes a little bit of 00:02:45.959 effort that next time that you practice 00:02:48.120 it because that effortful retrieval is 00:02:51.120 good for you it makes the connections in 00:02:53.360 your brain stronger the third big idea 00:02:55.879 is that your practice be 00:02:58.760 varied as opposed to monotonous so here 00:03:02.720 you want to kind of switch up your 00:03:05.159 practice in some way so that you're not 00:03:07.440 always doing exactly the same 00:03:10.599 thing you're not always practicing the 00:03:13.760 material in the same way you're keeping 00:03:17.000 it interesting in a way that prevents 00:03:19.760 your brain from kind of knowing what's 00:03:22.040 going to come next it's not repetitive 00:03:24.519 but instead is varied in the way that 00:03:27.680 life is varied that you don't know what 00:03:30.120 questions are going to come up when 00:03:31.599 you're going to need certain pieces of 00:03:33.200 knowledge or when you're going to need 00:03:34.879 to put to use a particular skill so if 00:03:37.760 you just wanted to get what I consider 00:03:39.760 to be the three biggest ideas from the 00:03:42.000 book you want those quick takeaways 00:03:44.599 there they are feel free to run with 00:03:46.439 those if you would like what we will do 00:03:48.360 now is pull in some specific examples 00:03:51.080 and a few more of the details from each 00:03:53.720 of those three big Ideas connected to 00:03:56.319 the idea of retrieval as opposed to 00:03:59.000 review the authors highlight the am I 00:04:02.959 still in frame here not quite let's try 00:04:05.959 that again the testing 00:04:09.799 effect so this one I found to be 00:04:14.439 interesting 00:04:16.000 because quizzes have kind of a bad wrap 00:04:19.320 in the schooling experience as something 00:04:21.918 that maybe is seen as not a particularly 00:04:25.919 useful learning activity for students 00:04:28.520 maybe even kind of like a boring 00:04:30.120 component of the schooling experience 00:04:32.479 but as it turns out when you give your 00:04:35.520 students or yourself a quiz where you 00:04:39.520 have to pull some information from 00:04:43.120 memory and uh respond to a particular 00:04:48.360 question what you're 00:04:50.320 doing is this useful Act of retrieval 00:04:53.960 you're solidifying the link between this 00:04:57.440 question and the particular answer by 00:05:00.400 kind of forcing your brain to to search 00:05:02.639 for that answer and pull it out of your 00:05:04.479 memory as opposed to accessing it just 00:05:07.080 by looking at what you underlined in the 00:05:09.240 textbook and this doesn't always have to 00:05:11.440 be kind of the I don't know boring 00:05:13.919 multiple choice test here it could be a 00:05:17.199 fill-in the blank or it could be an 00:05:19.080 open-ended question and in fact that 00:05:22.600 open-endedness comes into play with 00:05:25.080 another suggestion here in in the 00:05:27.400 category of retrieval which is is uh 00:05:30.880 represented here with a journal that you 00:05:34.960 maybe spend some time writing in every 00:05:39.039 day or 00:05:40.600 regularly in response to new things that 00:05:43.120 you're learning and this is the benefits 00:05:45.440 of reflection and elaboration so this 00:05:50.160 could be achieved with a journal or with 00:05:53.600 an open-ended question or prompt that 00:05:55.759 you might see on a quiz but here the 00:05:58.039 purpose of reflection and elaboration is 00:06:01.360 a little bit more about connecting the 00:06:03.560 ideas that you're retrieving to 00:06:05.479 something from your own personal life 00:06:07.800 your own past your experiences your 00:06:10.840 interests which helps you to connect the 00:06:13.800 new ideas that you're learning to ideas 00:06:16.800 that are already there in your brain 00:06:19.000 let's add an I right there this act of 00:06:22.599 retrieval might also take the form of 00:06:26.319 simple 00:06:28.039 flashcards where you add a question on 00:06:32.199 one side or a prompt of some sort the 00:06:35.319 answer is on the back you know how 00:06:37.759 flashcards work that's another kind of 00:06:40.240 quick way of getting it the same sort of 00:06:42.960 testing effect where your job is to pull 00:06:46.240 that information from memory and it's a 00:06:48.400 good way of kind of accurately testing 00:06:51.440 how well you know something and this is 00:06:53.479 a key point that they make kind of over 00:06:55.720 and over again throughout this book if 00:06:58.240 you focus on review instead of retrieval 00:07:01.400 review is where you look at what you 00:07:03.560 underlined you read your highlights you 00:07:06.120 review your notes it gives you the sense 00:07:08.720 of confidence like oh yeah I know this 00:07:11.120 this all makes sense I will remember 00:07:13.319 this when I need it in the future that's 00:07:15.520 a false sense of confidence because 00:07:18.440 understanding something while you're 00:07:19.599 reading it is a lot different than 00:07:21.879 pulling that information from memory so 00:07:24.520 that's what these three techniques get 00:07:27.199 at these ones a little bit more wrote 00:07:30.199 this one a little bit more open-ended 00:07:32.599 next let's talk about spaced here a 00:07:35.840 specific system was described called the 00:07:38.960 lightener system I forget lightner's 00:07:42.560 first name but the person who developed 00:07:45.599 this kind of encouraged you to perhaps 00:07:48.360 think about what you're 00:07:49.879 reviewing um as a a set of boxes so what 00:07:54.599 I will draw here 00:07:57.240 are oh you might might think of these as 00:08:00.520 boxes to store flashcards 00:08:03.759 perhaps as you're learning something new 00:08:07.319 and as your your number of flash cards 00:08:10.039 grow let's say you're learning a new 00:08:12.159 language and each flash card has one 00:08:14.720 vocabulary word on it over time you're 00:08:17.759 going to get a lot of those you're not 00:08:19.639 necessarily going to want to spend time 00:08:22.680 every day with each of those that will 00:08:25.479 get maybe a little bit boring and 00:08:27.120 repetitive and maybe take more time than 00:08:29.360 you have and reviewing those cards every 00:08:31.720 single day is actually a little bit less 00:08:34.039 efficient and effective because you're 00:08:36.200 not giving your brain the opportunity to 00:08:38.479 forget a little bit to do the extra work 00:08:41.799 of searching your brain for that piece 00:08:43.958 of information because that extra effort 00:08:46.680 is what strengthens the connections so 00:08:49.000 the way this system works is that maybe 00:08:51.080 you have one box 00:08:53.399 for the newest information that you're 00:08:55.920 learning that you maybe do want to quiz 00:08:58.920 yourself yourself on on a daily basis 00:09:02.079 but then once you answer that correctly 00:09:05.120 maybe a few days in a row then it can 00:09:07.839 move to your weekly box this is the 00:09:12.519 information that you quiz yourself on 00:09:14.600 once a week once you go a couple of 00:09:17.320 weeks correctly answering a particular 00:09:20.320 prompt then it can move over to a 00:09:23.240 monthly box once you have correctly 00:09:27.000 answered these ones a couple months in a 00:09:29.640 row then it can move over to a quarterly 00:09:32.720 where every 3 months you test your 00:09:34.800 knowledge and this maybe is where it 00:09:37.320 stays even if you keep getting those 00:09:39.880 correct you still want to do occasional 00:09:42.680 review occasional retrieval I should say 00:09:46.360 because if you don't do any retrieval 00:09:48.560 then it is likely that that information 00:09:50.720 will kind of completely Fade Into the 00:09:53.160 background and you won't be able to pull 00:09:54.920 it back when you need it so maybe you 00:09:57.040 set up these four boxes and you know if 00:10:00.760 you get your weekly ones right a couple 00:10:03.880 times you get to move it over move it up 00:10:06.560 to the thing that you study only monthly 00:10:09.600 but if you get it wrong here you 00:10:12.040 probably want to go back all the way to 00:10:14.360 daily and kind of start over again so 00:10:17.120 this is kind of a system for getting the 00:10:18.920 most bang for your buck make sure that 00:10:21.120 you're not studying material too 00:10:23.240 frequently but you're spacing it out 00:10:25.600 enough to make your learning efficient 00:10:28.240 only study daily the things that you 00:10:30.120 need to study daily but then even in the 00:10:32.920 kind of largest space you're still 00:10:35.120 making sure to regularly practice the 00:10:38.360 the information that is still important 00:10:40.480 to you that you want to be able to pull 00:10:42.360 out and use on a moment's notice so 00:10:44.720 that's the key idea with spacing out 00:10:46.680 your learning next let's tackle the 00:10:48.880 third component of keeping some variety 00:10:52.320 to your studying habits and there's two 00:10:54.880 examples that I want to bring in here 00:10:56.959 both of which involve physical skill s 00:10:59.440 and Sports in one form or another the 00:11:02.240 first one is a baseball example so I'm 00:11:07.320 going to attempt to draw a 00:11:14.320 picture winding up for the 00:11:17.480 pitch and then of course we're going to 00:11:19.440 have a batter over 00:11:23.920 here what might be a common practice in 00:11:28.040 baseball and perhaps other sports is 00:11:30.000 that say you're you're doing batting 00:11:32.560 practice maybe in recent games you've 00:11:35.600 struck out a couple time because of 00:11:37.920 curveballs so you want to get practice 00:11:40.240 hitting curveballs so your coach throws 00:11:43.000 you curveball after curveball after 00:11:45.040 curveball and you start to get really 00:11:47.120 good at hitting them your confidence 00:11:49.040 grows you're like hey I'm ready now for 00:11:51.399 the next time that pitcher is going to 00:11:53.079 throw me a curveball I'm going to knock 00:11:54.399 it out of the park there's a key 00:11:55.920 difference between that practice 00:11:57.320 experience and what you're going to face 00:11:58.959 space in a game and that's that when you 00:12:01.399 step up to the plate you have no idea 00:12:03.839 what type of pitch is going to be thrown 00:12:06.320 you don't know when it's going to be a 00:12:08.320 curveball so in practice what you got 00:12:10.440 good at is hitting curveballs when you 00:12:12.320 know a curveball is coming but really 00:12:14.560 what you need to get good at is the 00:12:16.639 Discrimination skills of interpreting in 00:12:19.560 a split second what type of pitch it is 00:12:22.360 and whether it's worth taking a swing at 00:12:24.480 so that's an example of including 00:12:26.760 helpful variation in the skill building 00:12:29.519 process so that what you develop are 00:12:31.480 those discrimination skills so that you 00:12:33.800 get good at recognizing when it's a 00:12:37.279 curveball or fast ball or knuckle ball 00:12:41.079 so this is an example of a physical 00:12:43.199 skill but the same applies to something 00:12:46.680 maybe more purely intellectual I think 00:12:49.480 an example given was someone who's 00:12:52.120 learning how to identify different birds 00:12:54.240 it's more helpful to study a variety of 00:12:57.519 birds to intermix the the type of birds 00:13:00.040 that you're identifying instead of 00:13:01.959 focusing on one species of bird at a 00:13:04.519 time because that focus on one species 00:13:07.320 at a time that's not true to the 00:13:09.399 experience that you'll have when you're 00:13:11.360 out on a hike listening and looking for 00:13:14.320 Birds it's the Discrimination skills 00:13:17.079 among different species that's more 00:13:18.920 important and more useful another 00:13:20.639 interesting example in this same realm 00:13:23.040 had to do with tossing a bag into a 00:13:27.240 bucket which isn't an actual ual game 00:13:29.320 but is close enough to cornhole which is 00:13:31.839 what I thought I would sketch out here 00:13:34.000 to make this point with one board over 00:13:36.920 here one about right here so when you're 00:13:41.720 playing cornhole the you know the range 00:13:45.399 of uh where where you are as the person 00:13:48.000 throwing is somewhere right around here 00:13:51.279 I think this is true just to the right 00:13:53.240 or just to the left of your board here 00:13:56.399 what they actually found was that it was 00:13:58.800 more useful to practice not exclusively 00:14:02.600 in this area but instead a little bit in 00:14:06.000 front of and a little bit behind where 00:14:09.120 you actually throw so practicing here or 00:14:12.920 back over here folks got better at 00:14:16.399 actually successfully throwing the bag 00:14:19.800 into the bucket even if the goal was to 00:14:22.399 get good at throwing it into the bucket 00:14:25.000 from a distance of 4 feet I think they 00:14:27.120 had two different groups one group 00:14:28.959 people only practiced at 4 feet the 00:14:31.959 other group practiced from 3 feet and 00:14:34.759 then from 5T and then they both had a 00:14:38.079 test where they saw how good they were 00:14:41.160 at throwing the bag into the bucket at 4 00:14:43.759 feet the folks who practiced at 3T and 00:14:46.560 5T were better at that task than the 00:14:49.320 folks who only practiced at 4 feet now 00:14:52.079 the implications for cornhole might not 00:14:54.360 be that interesting but think about free 00:14:56.759 throws if the results of that study are 00:14:59.240 repeatable that means if you're 00:15:01.360 practicing your free throw shots it will 00:15:03.440 be more helpful to practice in front of 00:15:05.440 the free throw line and behind the free 00:15:08.199 throw line and not just specifically in 00:15:11.279 that one spot where the free throw line 00:15:13.440 is that's pretty counterintuitive and I 00:15:16.040 don't know if there's any coach out 00:15:17.720 there that is actually practicing free 00:15:19.560 throws in that way encouraging their 00:15:21.120 players to so my hope there is that 00:15:24.240 those kind of extra examples give a 00:15:26.120 little bit more depth to these key IDE 00:15:28.639 ideas of focusing on retrieval instead 00:15:30.920 of review spacing out your learning 00:15:33.120 instead of cramming and making sure that 00:15:35.279 your learning activities are varied 00:15:37.120 instead of monotonous if we start to 00:15:39.720 think now about how that applies to the 00:15:42.120 development of your sketch noting skills 00:15:45.120 one implication is that you practice 00:15:47.680 drawing elements that are in your visual 00:15:50.720 vocabulary not by looking at a reference 00:15:53.839 but seeing if you can draw those things 00:15:55.399 from memory and then practice different 00:15:58.360 C categories of drawings and diagrams 00:16:01.720 together as opposed to just practicing 00:16:04.319 drawing people and then just practice 00:16:06.800 drawing notebooks and pens to maybe mix 00:16:10.000 up the category of drawings or diagrams 00:16:13.880 or writing styles because that's what 00:16:16.279 you'll be doing in a sketch noting 00:16:18.480 session you're not only going to be 00:16:20.519 drawing people or only writing words 00:16:23.040 you're going to be doing it all together 00:16:24.959 so weave that variation into your 00:16:27.120 practice I also think it's helpful to 00:16:29.079 think about what the creation of a 00:16:32.680 visual artifact like the one behind me 00:16:35.680 now what that facilitates in the future 00:16:38.399 as it relates to solidifying new 00:16:41.160 information and helping you apply 00:16:44.240 strategies or ideas you learned in the 00:16:46.399 future if you think about that retrieval 00:16:48.959 process I think it's easier to retrieve 00:16:51.920 a picture from your mind then it is a 00:16:55.120 bullet point list or key ideas within a 00:16:57.920 paragraph so one thing you might 00:17:00.240 practice retrieving from memory is 00:17:03.600 something like this full sketch note 00:17:06.240 that's what I enjoy doing especially 00:17:08.119 with the books that I read is if I'm out 00:17:10.880 on a walk or going for a run I find it 00:17:13.559 helpful and interesting to think about a 00:17:16.079 book that I've read in the past year or 00:17:18.119 past couple of years if I created this 00:17:20.439 sort of visual summary of it I try to 00:17:23.880 piece together that visual summary in my 00:17:26.199 mind as I'm pulling in those key 00:17:28.799 Concepts from the book and applying them 00:17:31.799 to what's going on in my life at that 00:17:34.280 moment I like to use books like these as 00:17:38.200 a lens through which to view my current 00:17:41.640 actions or the current thing that I'm 00:17:43.760 dealing with so I might ask myself what 00:17:46.480 would the book make it stick have to say 00:17:48.760 about the way that I'm teaching the 00:17:51.240 skill of sketch noting and encouraging 00:17:53.440 others to develop this skill what would 00:17:55.559 the book what works by Tara McMullan 00:17:57.880 have to say about how I'm thinking about 00:17:59.919 goal setting for 2024 what would the 00:18:02.480 book the psychology of money have to say 00:18:04.880 about how I'm thinking through my 00:18:06.640 financial decisions and while yes I 00:18:08.799 could simply review my past notes as I'm 00:18:12.960 thinking through those things I do like 00:18:15.320 the idea of being able to pull that from 00:18:17.840 my memory in the moment when I'm making 00:18:20.400 various decisions and having a visual 00:18:23.120 like this that I am over time kind of 00:18:26.520 embedding into my brain through spaced 00:18:29.559 retrieval I find that to be an 00:18:31.880 intriguing proposition and something 00:18:33.960 that's kind of fun to work toward if you 00:18:36.000 too would like to develop the skill of 00:18:38.080 sketching out ideas to deepen your 00:18:41.159 learning of the books you're reading or 00:18:43.360 podcast you're listening to conferences 00:18:45.720 you're attending I encourage you to 00:18:47.880 check out the resources at verbal to 00:18:49.640 visual.com there you can find a full 00:18:51.799 library of courses to get you up and 00:18:53.640 running with this skill and I hope that 00:18:55.400 you found this particular visual summary 00:18:57.840 to be use f for your own learning 00:19:00.039 perhaps your own teaching so I wish you 00:19:02.039 luck in implementing these ideas to 00:19:04.799 whatever skills or knowledge you're 00:19:06.679 developing right now and I look forward 00:19:08.520 to sketching out more interesting ideas 00:19:10.960 in the next video I'll see you then",

and welcome to verbal to visual 00:00:02.000 I'm Doug Neil and today we're going to 00:00:04.319 be talking about this book right here 00:00:06.960 make it stick the science of successful 00:00:09.599 learning this book came out about a 00:00:11.759 decade ago and has been on my reading 00:00:14.400 list for a while because even though I 00:00:17.160 went to school to become a teacher and 00:00:19.439 have been teaching and learning for much 00:00:23.039 of my life uh I've been wanting to have 00:00:26.000 you know kind of a a set of principles 00:00:28.439 based in science to influence how I 00:00:31.560 teach and also to reflect on the role 00:00:34.920 that the skill that I teach the skill of 00:00:37.719 sketching out ideas what that can play 00:00:40.520 in the learning process so what I would 00:00:42.840 like to do today is sketch out some of 00:00:44.879 my favorite ideas from that book and 00:00:48.399 reflect a little bit on what they have 00:00:50.160 to say about sketch noting I think the 00:00:52.680 main ideas from this book fall into 00:00:55.600 three categories that I'm going to 00:00:57.680 capture as a v diagram 00:01:08.240 and if we capture or incorporate all 00:01:11.960 three of these main ideas about 00:01:14.880 successful learning for the center of 00:01:17.520 this diagram that's where we will be 00:01:19.880 giving ourselves the best opportunity 00:01:22.079 that what we learn will actually stick 00:01:24.759 so I'll First share each of these three 00:01:26.920 main components and then we'll do a 00:01:28.920 little bit of a deep dive into each of 00:01:30.720 them the first of the three is that 00:01:33.439 sticky learning is about 00:01:36.560 retrieval not review so it's about 00:01:39.840 pulling ideas from memory as opposed to 00:01:45.079 just looking back at something like the 00:01:48.439 things you underlined in a book or your 00:01:50.560 highlights or rereading your bullet 00:01:53.119 point notes that type of rereading or 00:01:55.759 review isn't helpful in solidifying that 00:01:58.680 knowledge what's more more helpful is 00:02:01.560 prompting yourself with some question 00:02:03.799 and then having to pull that information 00:02:05.840 from memory the second overarching idea 00:02:08.679 is that your learning be 00:02:13.680 spaced and not crammed so here you 00:02:18.680 want a bit of separation between each 00:02:22.920 time you study uh a particular piece of 00:02:27.280 information or practice uh new 00:02:31.840 skill you want there to be a little bit 00:02:34.319 of time in between those practice 00:02:36.519 sessions because it's actually helpful 00:02:38.560 for you to forget a little bit or for it 00:02:41.440 to move kind of to a deeper part of your 00:02:43.840 brain so that it takes a little bit of 00:02:45.959 effort that next time that you practice 00:02:48.120 it because that effortful retrieval is 00:02:51.120 good for you it makes the connections in 00:02:53.360 your brain stronger the third big idea 00:02:55.879 is that your practice be 00:02:58.760 varied as opposed to monotonous so here 00:03:02.720 you want to kind of switch up your 00:03:05.159 practice in some way so that you're not 00:03:07.440 always doing exactly the same 00:03:10.599 thing you're not always practicing the 00:03:13.760 material in the same way you're keeping 00:03:17.000 it interesting in a way that prevents 00:03:19.760 your brain from kind of knowing what's 00:03:22.040 going to come next it's not repetitive 00:03:24.519 but instead is varied in the way that 00:03:27.680 life is varied that you don't know what 00:03:30.120 questions are going to come up when 00:03:31.599 you're going to need certain pieces of 00:03:33.200 knowledge or when you're going to need 00:03:34.879 to put to use a particular skill so if 00:03:37.760 you just wanted to get what I consider 00:03:39.760 to be the three biggest ideas from the 00:03:42.000 book you want those quick takeaways 00:03:44.599 there they are feel free to run with 00:03:46.439 those if you would like what we will do 00:03:48.360 now is pull in some specific examples 00:03:51.080 and a few more of the details from each 00:03:53.720 of those three big Ideas connected to 00:03:56.319 the idea of retrieval as opposed to 00:03:59.000 review the authors highlight the am I 00:04:02.959 still in frame here not quite let's try 00:04:05.959 that again the testing 00:04:09.799 effect so this one I found to be 00:04:14.439 interesting 00:04:16.000 because quizzes have kind of a bad wrap 00:04:19.320 in the schooling experience as something 00:04:21.918 that maybe is seen as not a particularly 00:04:25.919 useful learning activity for students 00:04:28.520 maybe even kind of like a boring 00:04:30.120 component of the schooling experience 00:04:32.479 but as it turns out when you give your 00:04:35.520 students or yourself a quiz where you 00:04:39.520 have to pull some information from 00:04:43.120 memory and uh respond to a particular 00:04:48.360 question what you're 00:04:50.320 doing is this useful Act of retrieval 00:04:53.960 you're solidifying the link between this 00:04:57.440 question and the particular answer by 00:05:00.400 kind of forcing your brain to to search 00:05:02.639 for that answer and pull it out of your 00:05:04.479 memory as opposed to accessing it just 00:05:07.080 by looking at what you underlined in the 00:05:09.240 textbook and this doesn't always have to 00:05:11.440 be kind of the I don't know boring 00:05:13.919 multiple choice test here it could be a 00:05:17.199 fill-in the blank or it could be an 00:05:19.080 open-ended question and in fact that 00:05:22.600 open-endedness comes into play with 00:05:25.080 another suggestion here in in the 00:05:27.400 category of retrieval which is is uh 00:05:30.880 represented here with a journal that you 00:05:34.960 maybe spend some time writing in every 00:05:39.039 day or 00:05:40.600 regularly in response to new things that 00:05:43.120 you're learning and this is the benefits 00:05:45.440 of reflection and elaboration so this 00:05:50.160 could be achieved with a journal or with 00:05:53.600 an open-ended question or prompt that 00:05:55.759 you might see on a quiz but here the 00:05:58.039 purpose of reflection and elaboration is 00:06:01.360 a little bit more about connecting the 00:06:03.560 ideas that you're retrieving to 00:06:05.479 something from your own personal life 00:06:07.800 your own past your experiences your 00:06:10.840 interests which helps you to connect the 00:06:13.800 new ideas that you're learning to ideas 00:06:16.800 that are already there in your brain 00:06:19.000 let's add an I right there this act of 00:06:22.599 retrieval might also take the form of 00:06:26.319 simple 00:06:28.039 flashcards where you add a question on 00:06:32.199 one side or a prompt of some sort the 00:06:35.319 answer is on the back you know how 00:06:37.759 flashcards work that's another kind of 00:06:40.240 quick way of getting it the same sort of 00:06:42.960 testing effect where your job is to pull 00:06:46.240 that information from memory and it's a 00:06:48.400 good way of kind of accurately testing 00:06:51.440 how well you know something and this is 00:06:53.479 a key point that they make kind of over 00:06:55.720 and over again throughout this book if 00:06:58.240 you focus on review instead of retrieval 00:07:01.400 review is where you look at what you 00:07:03.560 underlined you read your highlights you 00:07:06.120 review your notes it gives you the sense 00:07:08.720 of confidence like oh yeah I know this 00:07:11.120 this all makes sense I will remember 00:07:13.319 this when I need it in the future that's 00:07:15.520 a false sense of confidence because 00:07:18.440 understanding something while you're 00:07:19.599 reading it is a lot different than 00:07:21.879 pulling that information from memory so 00:07:24.520 that's what these three techniques get 00:07:27.199 at these ones a little bit more wrote 00:07:30.199 this one a little bit more open-ended 00:07:32.599 next let's talk about spaced here a 00:07:35.840 specific system was described called the 00:07:38.960 lightener system I forget lightner's 00:07:42.560 first name but the person who developed 00:07:45.599 this kind of encouraged you to perhaps 00:07:48.360 think about what you're 00:07:49.879 reviewing um as a a set of boxes so what 00:07:54.599 I will draw here 00:07:57.240 are oh you might might think of these as 00:08:00.520 boxes to store flashcards 00:08:03.759 perhaps as you're learning something new 00:08:07.319 and as your your number of flash cards 00:08:10.039 grow let's say you're learning a new 00:08:12.159 language and each flash card has one 00:08:14.720 vocabulary word on it over time you're 00:08:17.759 going to get a lot of those you're not 00:08:19.639 necessarily going to want to spend time 00:08:22.680 every day with each of those that will 00:08:25.479 get maybe a little bit boring and 00:08:27.120 repetitive and maybe take more time than 00:08:29.360 you have and reviewing those cards every 00:08:31.720 single day is actually a little bit less 00:08:34.039 efficient and effective because you're 00:08:36.200 not giving your brain the opportunity to 00:08:38.479 forget a little bit to do the extra work 00:08:41.799 of searching your brain for that piece 00:08:43.958 of information because that extra effort 00:08:46.680 is what strengthens the connections so 00:08:49.000 the way this system works is that maybe 00:08:51.080 you have one box 00:08:53.399 for the newest information that you're 00:08:55.920 learning that you maybe do want to quiz 00:08:58.920 yourself yourself on on a daily basis 00:09:02.079 but then once you answer that correctly 00:09:05.120 maybe a few days in a row then it can 00:09:07.839 move to your weekly box this is the 00:09:12.519 information that you quiz yourself on 00:09:14.600 once a week once you go a couple of 00:09:17.320 weeks correctly answering a particular 00:09:20.320 prompt then it can move over to a 00:09:23.240 monthly box once you have correctly 00:09:27.000 answered these ones a couple months in a 00:09:29.640 row then it can move over to a quarterly 00:09:32.720 where every 3 months you test your 00:09:34.800 knowledge and this maybe is where it 00:09:37.320 stays even if you keep getting those 00:09:39.880 correct you still want to do occasional 00:09:42.680 review occasional retrieval I should say 00:09:46.360 because if you don't do any retrieval 00:09:48.560 then it is likely that that information 00:09:50.720 will kind of completely Fade Into the 00:09:53.160 background and you won't be able to pull 00:09:54.920 it back when you need it so maybe you 00:09:57.040 set up these four boxes and you know if 00:10:00.760 you get your weekly ones right a couple 00:10:03.880 times you get to move it over move it up 00:10:06.560 to the thing that you study only monthly 00:10:09.600 but if you get it wrong here you 00:10:12.040 probably want to go back all the way to 00:10:14.360 daily and kind of start over again so 00:10:17.120 this is kind of a system for getting the 00:10:18.920 most bang for your buck make sure that 00:10:21.120 you're not studying material too 00:10:23.240 frequently but you're spacing it out 00:10:25.600 enough to make your learning efficient 00:10:28.240 only study daily the things that you 00:10:30.120 need to study daily but then even in the 00:10:32.920 kind of largest space you're still 00:10:35.120 making sure to regularly practice the 00:10:38.360 the information that is still important 00:10:40.480 to you that you want to be able to pull 00:10:42.360 out and use on a moment's notice so 00:10:44.720 that's the key idea with spacing out 00:10:46.680 your learning next let's tackle the 00:10:48.880 third component of keeping some variety 00:10:52.320 to your studying habits and there's two 00:10:54.880 examples that I want to bring in here 00:10:56.959 both of which involve physical skill s 00:10:59.440 and Sports in one form or another the 00:11:02.240 first one is a baseball example so I'm 00:11:07.320 going to attempt to draw a 00:11:14.320 picture winding up for the 00:11:17.480 pitch and then of course we're going to 00:11:19.440 have a batter over 00:11:23.920 here what might be a common practice in 00:11:28.040 baseball and perhaps other sports is 00:11:30.000 that say you're you're doing batting 00:11:32.560 practice maybe in recent games you've 00:11:35.600 struck out a couple time because of 00:11:37.920 curveballs so you want to get practice 00:11:40.240 hitting curveballs so your coach throws 00:11:43.000 you curveball after curveball after 00:11:45.040 curveball and you start to get really 00:11:47.120 good at hitting them your confidence 00:11:49.040 grows you're like hey I'm ready now for 00:11:51.399 the next time that pitcher is going to 00:11:53.079 throw me a curveball I'm going to knock 00:11:54.399 it out of the park there's a key 00:11:55.920 difference between that practice 00:11:57.320 experience and what you're going to face 00:11:58.959 space in a game and that's that when you 00:12:01.399 step up to the plate you have no idea 00:12:03.839 what type of pitch is going to be thrown 00:12:06.320 you don't know when it's going to be a 00:12:08.320 curveball so in practice what you got 00:12:10.440 good at is hitting curveballs when you 00:12:12.320 know a curveball is coming but really 00:12:14.560 what you need to get good at is the 00:12:16.639 Discrimination skills of interpreting in 00:12:19.560 a split second what type of pitch it is 00:12:22.360 and whether it's worth taking a swing at 00:12:24.480 so that's an example of including 00:12:26.760 helpful variation in the skill building 00:12:29.519 process so that what you develop are 00:12:31.480 those discrimination skills so that you 00:12:33.800 get good at recognizing when it's a 00:12:37.279 curveball or fast ball or knuckle ball 00:12:41.079 so this is an example of a physical 00:12:43.199 skill but the same applies to something 00:12:46.680 maybe more purely intellectual I think 00:12:49.480 an example given was someone who's 00:12:52.120 learning how to identify different birds 00:12:54.240 it's more helpful to study a variety of 00:12:57.519 birds to intermix the the type of birds 00:13:00.040 that you're identifying instead of 00:13:01.959 focusing on one species of bird at a 00:13:04.519 time because that focus on one species 00:13:07.320 at a time that's not true to the 00:13:09.399 experience that you'll have when you're 00:13:11.360 out on a hike listening and looking for 00:13:14.320 Birds it's the Discrimination skills 00:13:17.079 among different species that's more 00:13:18.920 important and more useful another 00:13:20.639 interesting example in this same realm 00:13:23.040 had to do with tossing a bag into a 00:13:27.240 bucket which isn't an actual ual game 00:13:29.320 but is close enough to cornhole which is 00:13:31.839 what I thought I would sketch out here 00:13:34.000 to make this point with one board over 00:13:36.920 here one about right here so when you're 00:13:41.720 playing cornhole the you know the range 00:13:45.399 of uh where where you are as the person 00:13:48.000 throwing is somewhere right around here 00:13:51.279 I think this is true just to the right 00:13:53.240 or just to the left of your board here 00:13:56.399 what they actually found was that it was 00:13:58.800 more useful to practice not exclusively 00:14:02.600 in this area but instead a little bit in 00:14:06.000 front of and a little bit behind where 00:14:09.120 you actually throw so practicing here or 00:14:12.920 back over here folks got better at 00:14:16.399 actually successfully throwing the bag 00:14:19.800 into the bucket even if the goal was to 00:14:22.399 get good at throwing it into the bucket 00:14:25.000 from a distance of 4 feet I think they 00:14:27.120 had two different groups one group 00:14:28.959 people only practiced at 4 feet the 00:14:31.959 other group practiced from 3 feet and 00:14:34.759 then from 5T and then they both had a 00:14:38.079 test where they saw how good they were 00:14:41.160 at throwing the bag into the bucket at 4 00:14:43.759 feet the folks who practiced at 3T and 00:14:46.560 5T were better at that task than the 00:14:49.320 folks who only practiced at 4 feet now 00:14:52.079 the implications for cornhole might not 00:14:54.360 be that interesting but think about free 00:14:56.759 throws if the results of that study are 00:14:59.240 repeatable that means if you're 00:15:01.360 practicing your free throw shots it will 00:15:03.440 be more helpful to practice in front of 00:15:05.440 the free throw line and behind the free 00:15:08.199 throw line and not just specifically in 00:15:11.279 that one spot where the free throw line 00:15:13.440 is that's pretty counterintuitive and I 00:15:16.040 don't know if there's any coach out 00:15:17.720 there that is actually practicing free 00:15:19.560 throws in that way encouraging their 00:15:21.120 players to so my hope there is that 00:15:24.240 those kind of extra examples give a 00:15:26.120 little bit more depth to these key IDE 00:15:28.639 ideas of focusing on retrieval instead 00:15:30.920 of review spacing out your learning 00:15:33.120 instead of cramming and making sure that 00:15:35.279 your learning activities are varied 00:15:37.120 instead of monotonous if we start to 00:15:39.720 think now about how that applies to the 00:15:42.120 development of your sketch noting skills 00:15:45.120 one implication is that you practice 00:15:47.680 drawing elements that are in your visual 00:15:50.720 vocabulary not by looking at a reference 00:15:53.839 but seeing if you can draw those things 00:15:55.399 from memory and then practice different 00:15:58.360 C categories of drawings and diagrams 00:16:01.720 together as opposed to just practicing 00:16:04.319 drawing people and then just practice 00:16:06.800 drawing notebooks and pens to maybe mix 00:16:10.000 up the category of drawings or diagrams 00:16:13.880 or writing styles because that's what 00:16:16.279 you'll be doing in a sketch noting 00:16:18.480 session you're not only going to be 00:16:20.519 drawing people or only writing words 00:16:23.040 you're going to be doing it all together 00:16:24.959 so weave that variation into your 00:16:27.120 practice I also think it's helpful to 00:16:29.079 think about what the creation of a 00:16:32.680 visual artifact like the one behind me 00:16:35.680 now what that facilitates in the future 00:16:38.399 as it relates to solidifying new 00:16:41.160 information and helping you apply 00:16:44.240 strategies or ideas you learned in the 00:16:46.399 future if you think about that retrieval 00:16:48.959 process I think it's easier to retrieve 00:16:51.920 a picture from your mind then it is a 00:16:55.120 bullet point list or key ideas within a 00:16:57.920 paragraph so one thing you might 00:17:00.240 practice retrieving from memory is 00:17:03.600 something like this full sketch note 00:17:06.240 that's what I enjoy doing especially 00:17:08.119 with the books that I read is if I'm out 00:17:10.880 on a walk or going for a run I find it 00:17:13.559 helpful and interesting to think about a 00:17:16.079 book that I've read in the past year or 00:17:18.119 past couple of years if I created this 00:17:20.439 sort of visual summary of it I try to 00:17:23.880 piece together that visual summary in my 00:17:26.199 mind as I'm pulling in those key 00:17:28.799 Concepts from the book and applying them 00:17:31.799 to what's going on in my life at that 00:17:34.280 moment I like to use books like these as 00:17:38.200 a lens through which to view my current 00:17:41.640 actions or the current thing that I'm 00:17:43.760 dealing with so I might ask myself what 00:17:46.480 would the book make it stick have to say 00:17:48.760 about the way that I'm teaching the 00:17:51.240 skill of sketch noting and encouraging 00:17:53.440 others to develop this skill what would 00:17:55.559 the book what works by Tara McMullan 00:17:57.880 have to say about how I'm thinking about 00:17:59.919 goal setting for 2024 what would the 00:18:02.480 book the psychology of money have to say 00:18:04.880 about how I'm thinking through my 00:18:06.640 financial decisions and while yes I 00:18:08.799 could simply review my past notes as I'm 00:18:12.960 thinking through those things I do like 00:18:15.320 the idea of being able to pull that from 00:18:17.840 my memory in the moment when I'm making 00:18:20.400 various decisions and having a visual 00:18:23.120 like this that I am over time kind of 00:18:26.520 embedding into my brain through spaced 00:18:29.559 retrieval I find that to be an 00:18:31.880 intriguing proposition and something 00:18:33.960 that's kind of fun to work toward if you 00:18:36.000 too would like to develop the skill of 00:18:38.080 sketching out ideas to deepen your 00:18:41.159 learning of the books you're reading or 00:18:43.360 podcast you're listening to conferences 00:18:45.720 you're attending I encourage you to 00:18:47.880 check out the resources at verbal to 00:18:49.640 visual.com there you can find a full 00:18:51.799 library of courses to get you up and 00:18:53.640 running with this skill and I hope that 00:18:55.400 you found this particular visual summary 00:18:57.840 to be use f for your own learning 00:19:00.039 perhaps your own teaching so I wish you 00:19:02.039 luck in implementing these ideas to 00:19:04.799 whatever skills or knowledge you're 00:19:06.679 developing right now and I look forward 00:19:08.520 to sketching out more interesting ideas 00:19:10.960 in the next video I'll see you then",

and welcome to verbal to visual 00:00:02.000 I'm Doug Neil and today we're going to 00:00:04.319 be talking about this book right here 00:00:06.960 make it stick the science of successful 00:00:09.599 learning this book came out about a 00:00:11.759 decade ago and has been on my reading 00:00:14.400 list for a while because even though I 00:00:17.160 went to school to become a teacher and 00:00:19.439 have been teaching and learning for much 00:00:23.039 of my life uh I've been wanting to have 00:00:26.000 you know kind of a a set of principles 00:00:28.439 based in science to influence how I 00:00:31.560 teach and also to reflect on the role 00:00:34.920 that the skill that I teach the skill of 00:00:37.719 sketching out ideas what that can play 00:00:40.520 in the learning process so what I would 00:00:42.840 like to do today is sketch out some of 00:00:44.879 my favorite ideas from that book and 00:00:48.399 reflect a little bit on what they have 00:00:50.160 to say about sketch noting I think the 00:00:52.680 main ideas from this book fall into 00:00:55.600 three categories that I'm going to 00:00:57.680 capture as a v diagram 00:01:08.240 and if we capture or incorporate all 00:01:11.960 three of these main ideas about 00:01:14.880 successful learning for the center of 00:01:17.520 this diagram that's where we will be 00:01:19.880 giving ourselves the best opportunity 00:01:22.079 that what we learn will actually stick 00:01:24.759 so I'll First share each of these three 00:01:26.920 main components and then we'll do a 00:01:28.920 little bit of a deep dive into each of 00:01:30.720 them the first of the three is that 00:01:33.439 sticky learning is about 00:01:36.560 retrieval not review so it's about 00:01:39.840 pulling ideas from memory as opposed to 00:01:45.079 just looking back at something like the 00:01:48.439 things you underlined in a book or your 00:01:50.560 highlights or rereading your bullet 00:01:53.119 point notes that type of rereading or 00:01:55.759 review isn't helpful in solidifying that 00:01:58.680 knowledge what's more more helpful is 00:02:01.560 prompting yourself with some question 00:02:03.799 and then having to pull that information 00:02:05.840 from memory the second overarching idea 00:02:08.679 is that your learning be 00:02:13.680 spaced and not crammed so here you 00:02:18.680 want a bit of separation between each 00:02:22.920 time you study uh a particular piece of 00:02:27.280 information or practice uh new 00:02:31.840 skill you want there to be a little bit 00:02:34.319 of time in between those practice 00:02:36.519 sessions because it's actually helpful 00:02:38.560 for you to forget a little bit or for it 00:02:41.440 to move kind of to a deeper part of your 00:02:43.840 brain so that it takes a little bit of 00:02:45.959 effort that next time that you practice 00:02:48.120 it because that effortful retrieval is 00:02:51.120 good for you it makes the connections in 00:02:53.360 your brain stronger the third big idea 00:02:55.879 is that your practice be 00:02:58.760 varied as opposed to monotonous so here 00:03:02.720 you want to kind of switch up your 00:03:05.159 practice in some way so that you're not 00:03:07.440 always doing exactly the same 00:03:10.599 thing you're not always practicing the 00:03:13.760 material in the same way you're keeping 00:03:17.000 it interesting in a way that prevents 00:03:19.760 your brain from kind of knowing what's 00:03:22.040 going to come next it's not repetitive 00:03:24.519 but instead is varied in the way that 00:03:27.680 life is varied that you don't know what 00:03:30.120 questions are going to come up when 00:03:31.599 you're going to need certain pieces of 00:03:33.200 knowledge or when you're going to need 00:03:34.879 to put to use a particular skill so if 00:03:37.760 you just wanted to get what I consider 00:03:39.760 to be the three biggest ideas from the 00:03:42.000 book you want those quick takeaways 00:03:44.599 there they are feel free to run with 00:03:46.439 those if you would like what we will do 00:03:48.360 now is pull in some specific examples 00:03:51.080 and a few more of the details from each 00:03:53.720 of those three big Ideas connected to 00:03:56.319 the idea of retrieval as opposed to 00:03:59.000 review the authors highlight the am I 00:04:02.959 still in frame here not quite let's try 00:04:05.959 that again the testing 00:04:09.799 effect so this one I found to be 00:04:14.439 interesting 00:04:16.000 because quizzes have kind of a bad wrap 00:04:19.320 in the schooling experience as something 00:04:21.918 that maybe is seen as not a particularly 00:04:25.919 useful learning activity for students 00:04:28.520 maybe even kind of like a boring 00:04:30.120 component of the schooling experience 00:04:32.479 but as it turns out when you give your 00:04:35.520 students or yourself a quiz where you 00:04:39.520 have to pull some information from 00:04:43.120 memory and uh respond to a particular 00:04:48.360 question what you're 00:04:50.320 doing is this useful Act of retrieval 00:04:53.960 you're solidifying the link between this 00:04:57.440 question and the particular answer by 00:05:00.400 kind of forcing your brain to to search 00:05:02.639 for that answer and pull it out of your 00:05:04.479 memory as opposed to accessing it just 00:05:07.080 by looking at what you underlined in the 00:05:09.240 textbook and this doesn't always have to 00:05:11.440 be kind of the I don't know boring 00:05:13.919 multiple choice test here it could be a 00:05:17.199 fill-in the blank or it could be an 00:05:19.080 open-ended question and in fact that 00:05:22.600 open-endedness comes into play with 00:05:25.080 another suggestion here in in the 00:05:27.400 category of retrieval which is is uh 00:05:30.880 represented here with a journal that you 00:05:34.960 maybe spend some time writing in every 00:05:39.039 day or 00:05:40.600 regularly in response to new things that 00:05:43.120 you're learning and this is the benefits 00:05:45.440 of reflection and elaboration so this 00:05:50.160 could be achieved with a journal or with 00:05:53.600 an open-ended question or prompt that 00:05:55.759 you might see on a quiz but here the 00:05:58.039 purpose of reflection and elaboration is 00:06:01.360 a little bit more about connecting the 00:06:03.560 ideas that you're retrieving to 00:06:05.479 something from your own personal life 00:06:07.800 your own past your experiences your 00:06:10.840 interests which helps you to connect the 00:06:13.800 new ideas that you're learning to ideas 00:06:16.800 that are already there in your brain 00:06:19.000 let's add an I right there this act of 00:06:22.599 retrieval might also take the form of 00:06:26.319 simple 00:06:28.039 flashcards where you add a question on 00:06:32.199 one side or a prompt of some sort the 00:06:35.319 answer is on the back you know how 00:06:37.759 flashcards work that's another kind of 00:06:40.240 quick way of getting it the same sort of 00:06:42.960 testing effect where your job is to pull 00:06:46.240 that information from memory and it's a 00:06:48.400 good way of kind of accurately testing 00:06:51.440 how well you know something and this is 00:06:53.479 a key point that they make kind of over 00:06:55.720 and over again throughout this book if 00:06:58.240 you focus on review instead of retrieval 00:07:01.400 review is where you look at what you 00:07:03.560 underlined you read your highlights you 00:07:06.120 review your notes it gives you the sense 00:07:08.720 of confidence like oh yeah I know this 00:07:11.120 this all makes sense I will remember 00:07:13.319 this when I need it in the future that's 00:07:15.520 a false sense of confidence because 00:07:18.440 understanding something while you're 00:07:19.599 reading it is a lot different than 00:07:21.879 pulling that information from memory so 00:07:24.520 that's what these three techniques get 00:07:27.199 at these ones a little bit more wrote 00:07:30.199 this one a little bit more open-ended 00:07:32.599 next let's talk about spaced here a 00:07:35.840 specific system was described called the 00:07:38.960 lightener system I forget lightner's 00:07:42.560 first name but the person who developed 00:07:45.599 this kind of encouraged you to perhaps 00:07:48.360 think about what you're 00:07:49.879 reviewing um as a a set of boxes so what 00:07:54.599 I will draw here 00:07:57.240 are oh you might might think of these as 00:08:00.520 boxes to store flashcards 00:08:03.759 perhaps as you're learning something new 00:08:07.319 and as your your number of flash cards 00:08:10.039 grow let's say you're learning a new 00:08:12.159 language and each flash card has one 00:08:14.720 vocabulary word on it over time you're 00:08:17.759 going to get a lot of those you're not 00:08:19.639 necessarily going to want to spend time 00:08:22.680 every day with each of those that will 00:08:25.479 get maybe a little bit boring and 00:08:27.120 repetitive and maybe take more time than 00:08:29.360 you have and reviewing those cards every 00:08:31.720 single day is actually a little bit less 00:08:34.039 efficient and effective because you're 00:08:36.200 not giving your brain the opportunity to 00:08:38.479 forget a little bit to do the extra work 00:08:41.799 of searching your brain for that piece 00:08:43.958 of information because that extra effort 00:08:46.680 is what strengthens the connections so 00:08:49.000 the way this system works is that maybe 00:08:51.080 you have one box 00:08:53.399 for the newest information that you're 00:08:55.920 learning that you maybe do want to quiz 00:08:58.920 yourself yourself on on a daily basis 00:09:02.079 but then once you answer that correctly 00:09:05.120 maybe a few days in a row then it can 00:09:07.839 move to your weekly box this is the 00:09:12.519 information that you quiz yourself on 00:09:14.600 once a week once you go a couple of 00:09:17.320 weeks correctly answering a particular 00:09:20.320 prompt then it can move over to a 00:09:23.240 monthly box once you have correctly 00:09:27.000 answered these ones a couple months in a 00:09:29.640 row then it can move over to a quarterly 00:09:32.720 where every 3 months you test your 00:09:34.800 knowledge and this maybe is where it 00:09:37.320 stays even if you keep getting those 00:09:39.880 correct you still want to do occasional 00:09:42.680 review occasional retrieval I should say 00:09:46.360 because if you don't do any retrieval 00:09:48.560 then it is likely that that information 00:09:50.720 will kind of completely Fade Into the 00:09:53.160 background and you won't be able to pull 00:09:54.920 it back when you need it so maybe you 00:09:57.040 set up these four boxes and you know if 00:10:00.760 you get your weekly ones right a couple 00:10:03.880 times you get to move it over move it up 00:10:06.560 to the thing that you study only monthly 00:10:09.600 but if you get it wrong here you 00:10:12.040 probably want to go back all the way to 00:10:14.360 daily and kind of start over again so 00:10:17.120 this is kind of a system for getting the 00:10:18.920 most bang for your buck make sure that 00:10:21.120 you're not studying material too 00:10:23.240 frequently but you're spacing it out 00:10:25.600 enough to make your learning efficient 00:10:28.240 only study daily the things that you 00:10:30.120 need to study daily but then even in the 00:10:32.920 kind of largest space you're still 00:10:35.120 making sure to regularly practice the 00:10:38.360 the information that is still important 00:10:40.480 to you that you want to be able to pull 00:10:42.360 out and use on a moment's notice so 00:10:44.720 that's the key idea with spacing out 00:10:46.680 your learning next let's tackle the 00:10:48.880 third component of keeping some variety 00:10:52.320 to your studying habits and there's two 00:10:54.880 examples that I want to bring in here 00:10:56.959 both of which involve physical skill s 00:10:59.440 and Sports in one form or another the 00:11:02.240 first one is a baseball example so I'm 00:11:07.320 going to attempt to draw a 00:11:14.320 picture winding up for the 00:11:17.480 pitch and then of course we're going to 00:11:19.440 have a batter over 00:11:23.920 here what might be a common practice in 00:11:28.040 baseball and perhaps other sports is 00:11:30.000 that say you're you're doing batting 00:11:32.560 practice maybe in recent games you've 00:11:35.600 struck out a couple time because of 00:11:37.920 curveballs so you want to get practice 00:11:40.240 hitting curveballs so your coach throws 00:11:43.000 you curveball after curveball after 00:11:45.040 curveball and you start to get really 00:11:47.120 good at hitting them your confidence 00:11:49.040 grows you're like hey I'm ready now for 00:11:51.399 the next time that pitcher is going to 00:11:53.079 throw me a curveball I'm going to knock 00:11:54.399 it out of the park there's a key 00:11:55.920 difference between that practice 00:11:57.320 experience and what you're going to face 00:11:58.959 space in a game and that's that when you 00:12:01.399 step up to the plate you have no idea 00:12:03.839 what type of pitch is going to be thrown 00:12:06.320 you don't know when it's going to be a 00:12:08.320 curveball so in practice what you got 00:12:10.440 good at is hitting curveballs when you 00:12:12.320 know a curveball is coming but really 00:12:14.560 what you need to get good at is the 00:12:16.639 Discrimination skills of interpreting in 00:12:19.560 a split second what type of pitch it is 00:12:22.360 and whether it's worth taking a swing at 00:12:24.480 so that's an example of including 00:12:26.760 helpful variation in the skill building 00:12:29.519 process so that what you develop are 00:12:31.480 those discrimination skills so that you 00:12:33.800 get good at recognizing when it's a 00:12:37.279 curveball or fast ball or knuckle ball 00:12:41.079 so this is an example of a physical 00:12:43.199 skill but the same applies to something 00:12:46.680 maybe more purely intellectual I think 00:12:49.480 an example given was someone who's 00:12:52.120 learning how to identify different birds 00:12:54.240 it's more helpful to study a variety of 00:12:57.519 birds to intermix the the type of birds 00:13:00.040 that you're identifying instead of 00:13:01.959 focusing on one species of bird at a 00:13:04.519 time because that focus on one species 00:13:07.320 at a time that's not true to the 00:13:09.399 experience that you'll have when you're 00:13:11.360 out on a hike listening and looking for 00:13:14.320 Birds it's the Discrimination skills 00:13:17.079 among different species that's more 00:13:18.920 important and more useful another 00:13:20.639 interesting example in this same realm 00:13:23.040 had to do with tossing a bag into a 00:13:27.240 bucket which isn't an actual ual game 00:13:29.320 but is close enough to cornhole which is 00:13:31.839 what I thought I would sketch out here 00:13:34.000 to make this point with one board over 00:13:36.920 here one about right here so when you're 00:13:41.720 playing cornhole the you know the range 00:13:45.399 of uh where where you are as the person 00:13:48.000 throwing is somewhere right around here 00:13:51.279 I think this is true just to the right 00:13:53.240 or just to the left of your board here 00:13:56.399 what they actually found was that it was 00:13:58.800 more useful to practice not exclusively 00:14:02.600 in this area but instead a little bit in 00:14:06.000 front of and a little bit behind where 00:14:09.120 you actually throw so practicing here or 00:14:12.920 back over here folks got better at 00:14:16.399 actually successfully throwing the bag 00:14:19.800 into the bucket even if the goal was to 00:14:22.399 get good at throwing it into the bucket 00:14:25.000 from a distance of 4 feet I think they 00:14:27.120 had two different groups one group 00:14:28.959 people only practiced at 4 feet the 00:14:31.959 other group practiced from 3 feet and 00:14:34.759 then from 5T and then they both had a 00:14:38.079 test where they saw how good they were 00:14:41.160 at throwing the bag into the bucket at 4 00:14:43.759 feet the folks who practiced at 3T and 00:14:46.560 5T were better at that task than the 00:14:49.320 folks who only practiced at 4 feet now 00:14:52.079 the implications for cornhole might not 00:14:54.360 be that interesting but think about free 00:14:56.759 throws if the results of that study are 00:14:59.240 repeatable that means if you're 00:15:01.360 practicing your free throw shots it will 00:15:03.440 be more helpful to practice in front of 00:15:05.440 the free throw line and behind the free 00:15:08.199 throw line and not just specifically in 00:15:11.279 that one spot where the free throw line 00:15:13.440 is that's pretty counterintuitive and I 00:15:16.040 don't know if there's any coach out 00:15:17.720 there that is actually practicing free 00:15:19.560 throws in that way encouraging their 00:15:21.120 players to so my hope there is that 00:15:24.240 those kind of extra examples give a 00:15:26.120 little bit more depth to these key IDE 00:15:28.639 ideas of focusing on retrieval instead 00:15:30.920 of review spacing out your learning 00:15:33.120 instead of cramming and making sure that 00:15:35.279 your learning activities are varied 00:15:37.120 instead of monotonous if we start to 00:15:39.720 think now about how that applies to the 00:15:42.120 development of your sketch noting skills 00:15:45.120 one implication is that you practice 00:15:47.680 drawing elements that are in your visual 00:15:50.720 vocabulary not by looking at a reference 00:15:53.839 but seeing if you can draw those things 00:15:55.399 from memory and then practice different 00:15:58.360 C categories of drawings and diagrams 00:16:01.720 together as opposed to just practicing 00:16:04.319 drawing people and then just practice 00:16:06.800 drawing notebooks and pens to maybe mix 00:16:10.000 up the category of drawings or diagrams 00:16:13.880 or writing styles because that's what 00:16:16.279 you'll be doing in a sketch noting 00:16:18.480 session you're not only going to be 00:16:20.519 drawing people or only writing words 00:16:23.040 you're going to be doing it all together 00:16:24.959 so weave that variation into your 00:16:27.120 practice I also think it's helpful to 00:16:29.079 think about what the creation of a 00:16:32.680 visual artifact like the one behind me 00:16:35.680 now what that facilitates in the future 00:16:38.399 as it relates to solidifying new 00:16:41.160 information and helping you apply 00:16:44.240 strategies or ideas you learned in the 00:16:46.399 future if you think about that retrieval 00:16:48.959 process I think it's easier to retrieve 00:16:51.920 a picture from your mind then it is a 00:16:55.120 bullet point list or key ideas within a 00:16:57.920 paragraph so one thing you might 00:17:00.240 practice retrieving from memory is 00:17:03.600 something like this full sketch note 00:17:06.240 that's what I enjoy doing especially 00:17:08.119 with the books that I read is if I'm out 00:17:10.880 on a walk or going for a run I find it 00:17:13.559 helpful and interesting to think about a 00:17:16.079 book that I've read in the past year or 00:17:18.119 past couple of years if I created this 00:17:20.439 sort of visual summary of it I try to 00:17:23.880 piece together that visual summary in my 00:17:26.199 mind as I'm pulling in those key 00:17:28.799 Concepts from the book and applying them 00:17:31.799 to what's going on in my life at that 00:17:34.280 moment I like to use books like these as 00:17:38.200 a lens through which to view my current 00:17:41.640 actions or the current thing that I'm 00:17:43.760 dealing with so I might ask myself what 00:17:46.480 would the book make it stick have to say 00:17:48.760 about the way that I'm teaching the 00:17:51.240 skill of sketch noting and encouraging 00:17:53.440 others to develop this skill what would 00:17:55.559 the book what works by Tara McMullan 00:17:57.880 have to say about how I'm thinking about 00:17:59.919 goal setting for 2024 what would the 00:18:02.480 book the psychology of money have to say 00:18:04.880 about how I'm thinking through my 00:18:06.640 financial decisions and while yes I 00:18:08.799 could simply review my past notes as I'm 00:18:12.960 thinking through those things I do like 00:18:15.320 the idea of being able to pull that from 00:18:17.840 my memory in the moment when I'm making 00:18:20.400 various decisions and having a visual 00:18:23.120 like this that I am over time kind of 00:18:26.520 embedding into my brain through spaced 00:18:29.559 retrieval I find that to be an 00:18:31.880 intriguing proposition and something 00:18:33.960 that's kind of fun to work toward if you 00:18:36.000 too would like to develop the skill of 00:18:38.080 sketching out ideas to deepen your 00:18:41.159 learning of the books you're reading or 00:18:43.360 podcast you're listening to conferences 00:18:45.720 you're attending I encourage you to 00:18:47.880 check out the resources at verbal to 00:18:49.640 visual.com there you can find a full 00:18:51.799 library of courses to get you up and 00:18:53.640 running with this skill and I hope that 00:18:55.400 you found this particular visual summary 00:18:57.840 to be use f for your own learning 00:19:00.039 perhaps your own teaching so I wish you 00:19:02.039 luck in implementing these ideas to 00:19:04.799 whatever skills or knowledge you're 00:19:06.679 developing right now and I look forward 00:19:08.520 to sketching out more interesting ideas 00:19:10.960 in the next video I'll see you then",

and welcome to verbal to visual 00:00:02.000 I'm Doug Neil and today we're going to 00:00:04.319 be talking about this book right here 00:00:06.960 make it stick the science of successful 00:00:09.599 learning this book came out about a 00:00:11.759 decade ago and has been on my reading 00:00:14.400 list for a while because even though I 00:00:17.160 went to school to become a teacher and 00:00:19.439 have been teaching and learning for much 00:00:23.039 of my life uh I've been wanting to have 00:00:26.000 you know kind of a a set of principles 00:00:28.439 based in science to influence how I 00:00:31.560 teach and also to reflect on the role 00:00:34.920 that the skill that I teach the skill of 00:00:37.719 sketching out ideas what that can play 00:00:40.520 in the learning process so what I would 00:00:42.840 like to do today is sketch out some of 00:00:44.879 my favorite ideas from that book and 00:00:48.399 reflect a little bit on what they have 00:00:50.160 to say about sketch noting I think the 00:00:52.680 main ideas from this book fall into 00:00:55.600 three categories that I'm going to 00:00:57.680 capture as a v diagram 00:01:08.240 and if we capture or incorporate all 00:01:11.960 three of these main ideas about 00:01:14.880 successful learning for the center of 00:01:17.520 this diagram that's where we will be 00:01:19.880 giving ourselves the best opportunity 00:01:22.079 that what we learn will actually stick 00:01:24.759 so I'll First share each of these three 00:01:26.920 main components and then we'll do a 00:01:28.920 little bit of a deep dive into each of 00:01:30.720 them the first of the three is that 00:01:33.439 sticky learning is about 00:01:36.560 retrieval not review so it's about 00:01:39.840 pulling ideas from memory as opposed to 00:01:45.079 just looking back at something like the 00:01:48.439 things you underlined in a book or your 00:01:50.560 highlights or rereading your bullet 00:01:53.119 point notes that type of rereading or 00:01:55.759 review isn't helpful in solidifying that 00:01:58.680 knowledge what's more more helpful is 00:02:01.560 prompting yourself with some question 00:02:03.799 and then having to pull that information 00:02:05.840 from memory the second overarching idea 00:02:08.679 is that your learning be 00:02:13.680 spaced and not crammed so here you 00:02:18.680 want a bit of separation between each 00:02:22.920 time you study uh a particular piece of 00:02:27.280 information or practice uh new 00:02:31.840 skill you want there to be a little bit 00:02:34.319 of time in between those practice 00:02:36.519 sessions because it's actually helpful 00:02:38.560 for you to forget a little bit or for it 00:02:41.440 to move kind of to a deeper part of your 00:02:43.840 brain so that it takes a little bit of 00:02:45.959 effort that next time that you practice 00:02:48.120 it because that effortful retrieval is 00:02:51.120 good for you it makes the connections in 00:02:53.360 your brain stronger the third big idea 00:02:55.879 is that your practice be 00:02:58.760 varied as opposed to monotonous so here 00:03:02.720 you want to kind of switch up your 00:03:05.159 practice in some way so that you're not 00:03:07.440 always doing exactly the same 00:03:10.599 thing you're not always practicing the 00:03:13.760 material in the same way you're keeping 00:03:17.000 it interesting in a way that prevents 00:03:19.760 your brain from kind of knowing what's 00:03:22.040 going to come next it's not repetitive 00:03:24.519 but instead is varied in the way that 00:03:27.680 life is varied that you don't know what 00:03:30.120 questions are going to come up when 00:03:31.599 you're going to need certain pieces of 00:03:33.200 knowledge or when you're going to need 00:03:34.879 to put to use a particular skill so if 00:03:37.760 you just wanted to get what I consider 00:03:39.760 to be the three biggest ideas from the 00:03:42.000 book you want those quick takeaways 00:03:44.599 there they are feel free to run with 00:03:46.439 those if you would like what we will do 00:03:48.360 now is pull in some specific examples 00:03:51.080 and a few more of the details from each 00:03:53.720 of those three big Ideas connected to 00:03:56.319 the idea of retrieval as opposed to 00:03:59.000 review the authors highlight the am I 00:04:02.959 still in frame here not quite let's try 00:04:05.959 that again the testing 00:04:09.799 effect so this one I found to be 00:04:14.439 interesting 00:04:16.000 because quizzes have kind of a bad wrap 00:04:19.320 in the schooling experience as something 00:04:21.918 that maybe is seen as not a particularly 00:04:25.919 useful learning activity for students 00:04:28.520 maybe even kind of like a boring 00:04:30.120 component of the schooling experience 00:04:32.479 but as it turns out when you give your 00:04:35.520 students or yourself a quiz where you 00:04:39.520 have to pull some information from 00:04:43.120 memory and uh respond to a particular 00:04:48.360 question what you're 00:04:50.320 doing is this useful Act of retrieval 00:04:53.960 you're solidifying the link between this 00:04:57.440 question and the particular answer by 00:05:00.400 kind of forcing your brain to to search 00:05:02.639 for that answer and pull it out of your 00:05:04.479 memory as opposed to accessing it just 00:05:07.080 by looking at what you underlined in the 00:05:09.240 textbook and this doesn't always have to 00:05:11.440 be kind of the I don't know boring 00:05:13.919 multiple choice test here it could be a 00:05:17.199 fill-in the blank or it could be an 00:05:19.080 open-ended question and in fact that 00:05:22.600 open-endedness comes into play with 00:05:25.080 another suggestion here in in the 00:05:27.400 category of retrieval which is is uh 00:05:30.880 represented here with a journal that you 00:05:34.960 maybe spend some time writing in every 00:05:39.039 day or 00:05:40.600 regularly in response to new things that 00:05:43.120 you're learning and this is the benefits 00:05:45.440 of reflection and elaboration so this 00:05:50.160 could be achieved with a journal or with 00:05:53.600 an open-ended question or prompt that 00:05:55.759 you might see on a quiz but here the 00:05:58.039 purpose of reflection and elaboration is 00:06:01.360 a little bit more about connecting the 00:06:03.560 ideas that you're retrieving to 00:06:05.479 something from your own personal life 00:06:07.800 your own past your experiences your 00:06:10.840 interests which helps you to connect the 00:06:13.800 new ideas that you're learning to ideas 00:06:16.800 that are already there in your brain 00:06:19.000 let's add an I right there this act of 00:06:22.599 retrieval might also take the form of 00:06:26.319 simple 00:06:28.039 flashcards where you add a question on 00:06:32.199 one side or a prompt of some sort the 00:06:35.319 answer is on the back you know how 00:06:37.759 flashcards work that's another kind of 00:06:40.240 quick way of getting it the same sort of 00:06:42.960 testing effect where your job is to pull 00:06:46.240 that information from memory and it's a 00:06:48.400 good way of kind of accurately testing 00:06:51.440 how well you know something and this is 00:06:53.479 a key point that they make kind of over 00:06:55.720 and over again throughout this book if 00:06:58.240 you focus on review instead of retrieval 00:07:01.400 review is where you look at what you 00:07:03.560 underlined you read your highlights you 00:07:06.120 review your notes it gives you the sense 00:07:08.720 of confidence like oh yeah I know this 00:07:11.120 this all makes sense I will remember 00:07:13.319 this when I need it in the future that's 00:07:15.520 a false sense of confidence because 00:07:18.440 understanding something while you're 00:07:19.599 reading it is a lot different than 00:07:21.879 pulling that information from memory so 00:07:24.520 that's what these three techniques get 00:07:27.199 at these ones a little bit more wrote 00:07:30.199 this one a little bit more open-ended 00:07:32.599 next let's talk about spaced here a 00:07:35.840 specific system was described called the 00:07:38.960 lightener system I forget lightner's 00:07:42.560 first name but the person who developed 00:07:45.599 this kind of encouraged you to perhaps 00:07:48.360 think about what you're 00:07:49.879 reviewing um as a a set of boxes so what 00:07:54.599 I will draw here 00:07:57.240 are oh you might might think of these as 00:08:00.520 boxes to store flashcards 00:08:03.759 perhaps as you're learning something new 00:08:07.319 and as your your number of flash cards 00:08:10.039 grow let's say you're learning a new 00:08:12.159 language and each flash card has one 00:08:14.720 vocabulary word on it over time you're 00:08:17.759 going to get a lot of those you're not 00:08:19.639 necessarily going to want to spend time 00:08:22.680 every day with each of those that will 00:08:25.479 get maybe a little bit boring and 00:08:27.120 repetitive and maybe take more time than 00:08:29.360 you have and reviewing those cards every 00:08:31.720 single day is actually a little bit less 00:08:34.039 efficient and effective because you're 00:08:36.200 not giving your brain the opportunity to 00:08:38.479 forget a little bit to do the extra work 00:08:41.799 of searching your brain for that piece 00:08:43.958 of information because that extra effort 00:08:46.680 is what strengthens the connections so 00:08:49.000 the way this system works is that maybe 00:08:51.080 you have one box 00:08:53.399 for the newest information that you're 00:08:55.920 learning that you maybe do want to quiz 00:08:58.920 yourself yourself on on a daily basis 00:09:02.079 but then once you answer that correctly 00:09:05.120 maybe a few days in a row then it can 00:09:07.839 move to your weekly box this is the 00:09:12.519 information that you quiz yourself on 00:09:14.600 once a week once you go a couple of 00:09:17.320 weeks correctly answering a particular 00:09:20.320 prompt then it can move over to a 00:09:23.240 monthly box once you have correctly 00:09:27.000 answered these ones a couple months in a 00:09:29.640 row then it can move over to a quarterly 00:09:32.720 where every 3 months you test your 00:09:34.800 knowledge and this maybe is where it 00:09:37.320 stays even if you keep getting those 00:09:39.880 correct you still want to do occasional 00:09:42.680 review occasional retrieval I should say 00:09:46.360 because if you don't do any retrieval 00:09:48.560 then it is likely that that information 00:09:50.720 will kind of completely Fade Into the 00:09:53.160 background and you won't be able to pull 00:09:54.920 it back when you need it so maybe you 00:09:57.040 set up these four boxes and you know if 00:10:00.760 you get your weekly ones right a couple 00:10:03.880 times you get to move it over move it up 00:10:06.560 to the thing that you study only monthly 00:10:09.600 but if you get it wrong here you 00:10:12.040 probably want to go back all the way to 00:10:14.360 daily and kind of start over again so 00:10:17.120 this is kind of a system for getting the 00:10:18.920 most bang for your buck make sure that 00:10:21.120 you're not studying material too 00:10:23.240 frequently but you're spacing it out 00:10:25.600 enough to make your learning efficient 00:10:28.240 only study daily the things that you 00:10:30.120 need to study daily but then even in the 00:10:32.920 kind of largest space you're still 00:10:35.120 making sure to regularly practice the 00:10:38.360 the information that is still important 00:10:40.480 to you that you want to be able to pull 00:10:42.360 out and use on a moment's notice so 00:10:44.720 that's the key idea with spacing out 00:10:46.680 your learning next let's tackle the 00:10:48.880 third component of keeping some variety 00:10:52.320 to your studying habits and there's two 00:10:54.880 examples that I want to bring in here 00:10:56.959 both of which involve physical skill s 00:10:59.440 and Sports in one form or another the 00:11:02.240 first one is a baseball example so I'm 00:11:07.320 going to attempt to draw a 00:11:14.320 picture winding up for the 00:11:17.480 pitch and then of course we're going to 00:11:19.440 have a batter over 00:11:23.920 here what might be a common practice in 00:11:28.040 baseball and perhaps other sports is 00:11:30.000 that say you're you're doing batting 00:11:32.560 practice maybe in recent games you've 00:11:35.600 struck out a couple time because of 00:11:37.920 curveballs so you want to get practice 00:11:40.240 hitting curveballs so your coach throws 00:11:43.000 you curveball after curveball after 00:11:45.040 curveball and you start to get really 00:11:47.120 good at hitting them your confidence 00:11:49.040 grows you're like hey I'm ready now for 00:11:51.399 the next time that pitcher is going to 00:11:53.079 throw me a curveball I'm going to knock 00:11:54.399 it out of the park there's a key 00:11:55.920 difference between that practice 00:11:57.320 experience and what you're going to face 00:11:58.959 space in a game and that's that when you 00:12:01.399 step up to the plate you have no idea 00:12:03.839 what type of pitch is going to be thrown 00:12:06.320 you don't know when it's going to be a 00:12:08.320 curveball so in practice what you got 00:12:10.440 good at is hitting curveballs when you 00:12:12.320 know a curveball is coming but really 00:12:14.560 what you need to get good at is the 00:12:16.639 Discrimination skills of interpreting in 00:12:19.560 a split second what type of pitch it is 00:12:22.360 and whether it's worth taking a swing at 00:12:24.480 so that's an example of including 00:12:26.760 helpful variation in the skill building 00:12:29.519 process so that what you develop are 00:12:31.480 those discrimination skills so that you 00:12:33.800 get good at recognizing when it's a 00:12:37.279 curveball or fast ball or knuckle ball 00:12:41.079 so this is an example of a physical 00:12:43.199 skill but the same applies to something 00:12:46.680 maybe more purely intellectual I think 00:12:49.480 an example given was someone who's 00:12:52.120 learning how to identify different birds 00:12:54.240 it's more helpful to study a variety of 00:12:57.519 birds to intermix the the type of birds 00:13:00.040 that you're identifying instead of 00:13:01.959 focusing on one species of bird at a 00:13:04.519 time because that focus on one species 00:13:07.320 at a time that's not true to the 00:13:09.399 experience that you'll have when you're 00:13:11.360 out on a hike listening and looking for 00:13:14.320 Birds it's the Discrimination skills 00:13:17.079 among different species that's more 00:13:18.920 important and more useful another 00:13:20.639 interesting example in this same realm 00:13:23.040 had to do with tossing a bag into a 00:13:27.240 bucket which isn't an actual ual game 00:13:29.320 but is close enough to cornhole which is 00:13:31.839 what I thought I would sketch out here 00:13:34.000 to make this point with one board over 00:13:36.920 here one about right here so when you're 00:13:41.720 playing cornhole the you know the range 00:13:45.399 of uh where where you are as the person 00:13:48.000 throwing is somewhere right around here 00:13:51.279 I think this is true just to the right 00:13:53.240 or just to the left of your board here 00:13:56.399 what they actually found was that it was 00:13:58.800 more useful to practice not exclusively 00:14:02.600 in this area but instead a little bit in 00:14:06.000 front of and a little bit behind where 00:14:09.120 you actually throw so practicing here or 00:14:12.920 back over here folks got better at 00:14:16.399 actually successfully throwing the bag 00:14:19.800 into the bucket even if the goal was to 00:14:22.399 get good at throwing it into the bucket 00:14:25.000 from a distance of 4 feet I think they 00:14:27.120 had two different groups one group 00:14:28.959 people only practiced at 4 feet the 00:14:31.959 other group practiced from 3 feet and 00:14:34.759 then from 5T and then they both had a 00:14:38.079 test where they saw how good they were 00:14:41.160 at throwing the bag into the bucket at 4 00:14:43.759 feet the folks who practiced at 3T and 00:14:46.560 5T were better at that task than the 00:14:49.320 folks who only practiced at 4 feet now 00:14:52.079 the implications for cornhole might not 00:14:54.360 be that interesting but think about free 00:14:56.759 throws if the results of that study are 00:14:59.240 repeatable that means if you're 00:15:01.360 practicing your free throw shots it will 00:15:03.440 be more helpful to practice in front of 00:15:05.440 the free throw line and behind the free 00:15:08.199 throw line and not just specifically in 00:15:11.279 that one spot where the free throw line 00:15:13.440 is that's pretty counterintuitive and I 00:15:16.040 don't know if there's any coach out 00:15:17.720 there that is actually practicing free 00:15:19.560 throws in that way encouraging their 00:15:21.120 players to so my hope there is that 00:15:24.240 those kind of extra examples give a 00:15:26.120 little bit more depth to these key IDE 00:15:28.639 ideas of focusing on retrieval instead 00:15:30.920 of review spacing out your learning 00:15:33.120 instead of cramming and making sure that 00:15:35.279 your learning activities are varied 00:15:37.120 instead of monotonous if we start to 00:15:39.720 think now about how that applies to the 00:15:42.120 development of your sketch noting skills 00:15:45.120 one implication is that you practice 00:15:47.680 drawing elements that are in your visual 00:15:50.720 vocabulary not by looking at a reference 00:15:53.839 but seeing if you can draw those things 00:15:55.399 from memory and then practice different 00:15:58.360 C categories of drawings and diagrams 00:16:01.720 together as opposed to just practicing 00:16:04.319 drawing people and then just practice 00:16:06.800 drawing notebooks and pens to maybe mix 00:16:10.000 up the category of drawings or diagrams 00:16:13.880 or writing styles because that's what 00:16:16.279 you'll be doing in a sketch noting 00:16:18.480 session you're not only going to be 00:16:20.519 drawing people or only writing words 00:16:23.040 you're going to be doing it all together 00:16:24.959 so weave that variation into your 00:16:27.120 practice I also think it's helpful to 00:16:29.079 think about what the creation of a 00:16:32.680 visual artifact like the one behind me 00:16:35.680 now what that facilitates in the future 00:16:38.399 as it relates to solidifying new 00:16:41.160 information and helping you apply 00:16:44.240 strategies or ideas you learned in the 00:16:46.399 future if you think about that retrieval 00:16:48.959 process I think it's easier to retrieve 00:16:51.920 a picture from your mind then it is a 00:16:55.120 bullet point list or key ideas within a 00:16:57.920 paragraph so one thing you might 00:17:00.240 practice retrieving from memory is 00:17:03.600 something like this full sketch note 00:17:06.240 that's what I enjoy doing especially 00:17:08.119 with the books that I read is if I'm out 00:17:10.880 on a walk or going for a run I find it 00:17:13.559 helpful and interesting to think about a 00:17:16.079 book that I've read in the past year or 00:17:18.119 past couple of years if I created this 00:17:20.439 sort of visual summary of it I try to 00:17:23.880 piece together that visual summary in my 00:17:26.199 mind as I'm pulling in those key 00:17:28.799 Concepts from the book and applying them 00:17:31.799 to what's going on in my life at that 00:17:34.280 moment I like to use books like these as 00:17:38.200 a lens through which to view my current 00:17:41.640 actions or the current thing that I'm 00:17:43.760 dealing with so I might ask myself what 00:17:46.480 would the book make it stick have to say 00:17:48.760 about the way that I'm teaching the 00:17:51.240 skill of sketch noting and encouraging 00:17:53.440 others to develop this skill what would 00:17:55.559 the book what works by Tara McMullan 00:17:57.880 have to say about how I'm thinking about 00:17:59.919 goal setting for 2024 what would the 00:18:02.480 book the psychology of money have to say 00:18:04.880 about how I'm thinking through my 00:18:06.640 financial decisions and while yes I 00:18:08.799 could simply review my past notes as I'm 00:18:12.960 thinking through those things I do like 00:18:15.320 the idea of being able to pull that from 00:18:17.840 my memory in the moment when I'm making 00:18:20.400 various decisions and having a visual 00:18:23.120 like this that I am over time kind of 00:18:26.520 embedding into my brain through spaced 00:18:29.559 retrieval I find that to be an 00:18:31.880 intriguing proposition and something 00:18:33.960 that's kind of fun to work toward if you 00:18:36.000 too would like to develop the skill of 00:18:38.080 sketching out ideas to deepen your 00:18:41.159 learning of the books you're reading or 00:18:43.360 podcast you're listening to conferences 00:18:45.720 you're attending I encourage you to 00:18:47.880 check out the resources at verbal to 00:18:49.640 visual.com there you can find a full 00:18:51.799 library of courses to get you up and 00:18:53.640 running with this skill and I hope that 00:18:55.400 you found this particular visual summary 00:18:57.840 to be use f for your own learning 00:19:00.039 perhaps your own teaching so I wish you 00:19:02.039 luck in implementing these ideas to 00:19:04.799 whatever skills or knowledge you're 00:19:06.679 developing right now and I look forward 00:19:08.520 to sketching out more interesting ideas 00:19:10.960 in the next video I'll see you then",

and welcome to verbal to visual 00:00:02.000 I'm Doug Neil and today we're going to 00:00:04.319 be talking about this book right here 00:00:06.960 make it stick the science of successful 00:00:09.599 learning this book came out about a 00:00:11.759 decade ago and has been on my reading 00:00:14.400 list for a while because even though I 00:00:17.160 went to school to become a teacher and 00:00:19.439 have been teaching and learning for much 00:00:23.039 of my life uh I've been wanting to have 00:00:26.000 you know kind of a a set of principles 00:00:28.439 based in science to influence how I 00:00:31.560 teach and also to reflect on the role 00:00:34.920 that the skill that I teach the skill of 00:00:37.719 sketching out ideas what that can play 00:00:40.520 in the learning process so what I would 00:00:42.840 like to do today is sketch out some of 00:00:44.879 my favorite ideas from that book and 00:00:48.399 reflect a little bit on what they have 00:00:50.160 to say about sketch noting I think the 00:00:52.680 main ideas from this book fall into 00:00:55.600 three categories that I'm going to 00:00:57.680 capture as a v diagram 00:01:08.240 and if we capture or incorporate all 00:01:11.960 three of these main ideas about 00:01:14.880 successful learning for the center of 00:01:17.520 this diagram that's where we will be 00:01:19.880 giving ourselves the best opportunity 00:01:22.079 that what we learn will actually stick 00:01:24.759 so I'll First share each of these three 00:01:26.920 main components and then we'll do a 00:01:28.920 little bit of a deep dive into each of 00:01:30.720 them the first of the three is that 00:01:33.439 sticky learning is about 00:01:36.560 retrieval not review so it's about 00:01:39.840 pulling ideas from memory as opposed to 00:01:45.079 just looking back at something like the 00:01:48.439 things you underlined in a book or your 00:01:50.560 highlights or rereading your bullet 00:01:53.119 point notes that type of rereading or 00:01:55.759 review isn't helpful in solidifying that 00:01:58.680 knowledge what's more more helpful is 00:02:01.560 prompting yourself with some question 00:02:03.799 and then having to pull that information 00:02:05.840 from memory the second overarching idea 00:02:08.679 is that your learning be 00:02:13.680 spaced and not crammed so here you 00:02:18.680 want a bit of separation between each 00:02:22.920 time you study uh a particular piece of 00:02:27.280 information or practice uh new 00:02:31.840 skill you want there to be a little bit 00:02:34.319 of time in between those practice 00:02:36.519 sessions because it's actually helpful 00:02:38.560 for you to forget a little bit or for it 00:02:41.440 to move kind of to a deeper part of your 00:02:43.840 brain so that it takes a little bit of 00:02:45.959 effort that next time that you practice 00:02:48.120 it because that effortful retrieval is 00:02:51.120 good for you it makes the connections in 00:02:53.360 your brain stronger the third big idea 00:02:55.879 is that your practice be 00:02:58.760 varied as opposed to monotonous so here 00:03:02.720 you want to kind of switch up your 00:03:05.159 practice in some way so that you're not 00:03:07.440 always doing exactly the same 00:03:10.599 thing you're not always practicing the 00:03:13.760 material in the same way you're keeping 00:03:17.000 it interesting in a way that prevents 00:03:19.760 your brain from kind of knowing what's 00:03:22.040 going to come next it's not repetitive 00:03:24.519 but instead is varied in the way that 00:03:27.680 life is varied that you don't know what 00:03:30.120 questions are going to come up when 00:03:31.599 you're going to need certain pieces of 00:03:33.200 knowledge or when you're going to need 00:03:34.879 to put to use a particular skill so if 00:03:37.760 you just wanted to get what I consider 00:03:39.760 to be the three biggest ideas from the 00:03:42.000 book you want those quick takeaways 00:03:44.599 there they are feel free to run with 00:03:46.439 those if you would like what we will do 00:03:48.360 now is pull in some specific examples 00:03:51.080 and a few more of the details from each 00:03:53.720 of those three big Ideas connected to 00:03:56.319 the idea of retrieval as opposed to 00:03:59.000 review the authors highlight the am I 00:04:02.959 still in frame here not quite let's try 00:04:05.959 that again the testing 00:04:09.799 effect so this one I found to be 00:04:14.439 interesting 00:04:16.000 because quizzes have kind of a bad wrap 00:04:19.320 in the schooling experience as something 00:04:21.918 that maybe is seen as not a particularly 00:04:25.919 useful learning activity for students 00:04:28.520 maybe even kind of like a boring 00:04:30.120 component of the schooling experience 00:04:32.479 but as it turns out when you give your 00:04:35.520 students or yourself a quiz where you 00:04:39.520 have to pull some information from 00:04:43.120 memory and uh respond to a particular 00:04:48.360 question what you're 00:04:50.320 doing is this useful Act of retrieval 00:04:53.960 you're solidifying the link between this 00:04:57.440 question and the particular answer by 00:05:00.400 kind of forcing your brain to to search 00:05:02.639 for that answer and pull it out of your 00:05:04.479 memory as opposed to accessing it just 00:05:07.080 by looking at what you underlined in the 00:05:09.240 textbook and this doesn't always have to 00:05:11.440 be kind of the I don't know boring 00:05:13.919 multiple choice test here it could be a 00:05:17.199 fill-in the blank or it could be an 00:05:19.080 open-ended question and in fact that 00:05:22.600 open-endedness comes into play with 00:05:25.080 another suggestion here in in the 00:05:27.400 category of retrieval which is is uh 00:05:30.880 represented here with a journal that you 00:05:34.960 maybe spend some time writing in every 00:05:39.039 day or 00:05:40.600 regularly in response to new things that 00:05:43.120 you're learning and this is the benefits 00:05:45.440 of reflection and elaboration so this 00:05:50.160 could be achieved with a journal or with 00:05:53.600 an open-ended question or prompt that 00:05:55.759 you might see on a quiz but here the 00:05:58.039 purpose of reflection and elaboration is 00:06:01.360 a little bit more about connecting the 00:06:03.560 ideas that you're retrieving to 00:06:05.479 something from your own personal life 00:06:07.800 your own past your experiences your 00:06:10.840 interests which helps you to connect the 00:06:13.800 new ideas that you're learning to ideas 00:06:16.800 that are already there in your brain 00:06:19.000 let's add an I right there this act of 00:06:22.599 retrieval might also take the form of 00:06:26.319 simple 00:06:28.039 flashcards where you add a question on 00:06:32.199 one side or a prompt of some sort the 00:06:35.319 answer is on the back you know how 00:06:37.759 flashcards work that's another kind of 00:06:40.240 quick way of getting it the same sort of 00:06:42.960 testing effect where your job is to pull 00:06:46.240 that information from memory and it's a 00:06:48.400 good way of kind of accurately testing 00:06:51.440 how well you know something and this is 00:06:53.479 a key point that they make kind of over 00:06:55.720 and over again throughout this book if 00:06:58.240 you focus on review instead of retrieval 00:07:01.400 review is where you look at what you 00:07:03.560 underlined you read your highlights you 00:07:06.120 review your notes it gives you the sense 00:07:08.720 of confidence like oh yeah I know this 00:07:11.120 this all makes sense I will remember 00:07:13.319 this when I need it in the future that's 00:07:15.520 a false sense of confidence because 00:07:18.440 understanding something while you're 00:07:19.599 reading it is a lot different than 00:07:21.879 pulling that information from memory so 00:07:24.520 that's what these three techniques get 00:07:27.199 at these ones a little bit more wrote 00:07:30.199 this one a little bit more open-ended 00:07:32.599 next let's talk about spaced here a 00:07:35.840 specific system was described called the 00:07:38.960 lightener system I forget lightner's 00:07:42.560 first name but the person who developed 00:07:45.599 this kind of encouraged you to perhaps 00:07:48.360 think about what you're 00:07:49.879 reviewing um as a a set of boxes so what 00:07:54.599 I will draw here 00:07:57.240 are oh you might might think of these as 00:08:00.520 boxes to store flashcards 00:08:03.759 perhaps as you're learning something new 00:08:07.319 and as your your number of flash cards 00:08:10.039 grow let's say you're learning a new 00:08:12.159 language and each flash card has one 00:08:14.720 vocabulary word on it over time you're 00:08:17.759 going to get a lot of those you're not 00:08:19.639 necessarily going to want to spend time 00:08:22.680 every day with each of those that will 00:08:25.479 get maybe a little bit boring and 00:08:27.120 repetitive and maybe take more time than 00:08:29.360 you have and reviewing those cards every 00:08:31.720 single day is actually a little bit less 00:08:34.039 efficient and effective because you're 00:08:36.200 not giving your brain the opportunity to 00:08:38.479 forget a little bit to do the extra work 00:08:41.799 of searching your brain for that piece 00:08:43.958 of information because that extra effort 00:08:46.680 is what strengthens the connections so 00:08:49.000 the way this system works is that maybe 00:08:51.080 you have one box 00:08:53.399 for the newest information that you're 00:08:55.920 learning that you maybe do want to quiz 00:08:58.920 yourself yourself on on a daily basis 00:09:02.079 but then once you answer that correctly 00:09:05.120 maybe a few days in a row then it can 00:09:07.839 move to your weekly box this is the 00:09:12.519 information that you quiz yourself on 00:09:14.600 once a week once you go a couple of 00:09:17.320 weeks correctly answering a particular 00:09:20.320 prompt then it can move over to a 00:09:23.240 monthly box once you have correctly 00:09:27.000 answered these ones a couple months in a 00:09:29.640 row then it can move over to a quarterly 00:09:32.720 where every 3 months you test your 00:09:34.800 knowledge and this maybe is where it 00:09:37.320 stays even if you keep getting those 00:09:39.880 correct you still want to do occasional 00:09:42.680 review occasional retrieval I should say 00:09:46.360 because if you don't do any retrieval 00:09:48.560 then it is likely that that information 00:09:50.720 will kind of completely Fade Into the 00:09:53.160 background and you won't be able to pull 00:09:54.920 it back when you need it so maybe you 00:09:57.040 set up these four boxes and you know if 00:10:00.760 you get your weekly ones right a couple 00:10:03.880 times you get to move it over move it up 00:10:06.560 to the thing that you study only monthly 00:10:09.600 but if you get it wrong here you 00:10:12.040 probably want to go back all the way to 00:10:14.360 daily and kind of start over again so 00:10:17.120 this is kind of a system for getting the 00:10:18.920 most bang for your buck make sure that 00:10:21.120 you're not studying material too 00:10:23.240 frequently but you're spacing it out 00:10:25.600 enough to make your learning efficient 00:10:28.240 only study daily the things that you 00:10:30.120 need to study daily but then even in the 00:10:32.920 kind of largest space you're still 00:10:35.120 making sure to regularly practice the 00:10:38.360 the information that is still important 00:10:40.480 to you that you want to be able to pull 00:10:42.360 out and use on a moment's notice so 00:10:44.720 that's the key idea with spacing out 00:10:46.680 your learning next let's tackle the 00:10:48.880 third component of keeping some variety 00:10:52.320 to your studying habits and there's two 00:10:54.880 examples that I want to bring in here 00:10:56.959 both of which involve physical skill s 00:10:59.440 and Sports in one form or another the 00:11:02.240 first one is a baseball example so I'm 00:11:07.320 going to attempt to draw a 00:11:14.320 picture winding up for the 00:11:17.480 pitch and then of course we're going to 00:11:19.440 have a batter over 00:11:23.920 here what might be a common practice in 00:11:28.040 baseball and perhaps other sports is 00:11:30.000 that say you're you're doing batting 00:11:32.560 practice maybe in recent games you've 00:11:35.600 struck out a couple time because of 00:11:37.920 curveballs so you want to get practice 00:11:40.240 hitting curveballs so your coach throws 00:11:43.000 you curveball after curveball after 00:11:45.040 curveball and you start to get really 00:11:47.120 good at hitting them your confidence 00:11:49.040 grows you're like hey I'm ready now for 00:11:51.399 the next time that pitcher is going to 00:11:53.079 throw me a curveball I'm going to knock 00:11:54.399 it out of the park there's a key 00:11:55.920 difference between that practice 00:11:57.320 experience and what you're going to face 00:11:58.959 space in a game and that's that when you 00:12:01.399 step up to the plate you have no idea 00:12:03.839 what type of pitch is going to be thrown 00:12:06.320 you don't know when it's going to be a 00:12:08.320 curveball so in practice what you got 00:12:10.440 good at is hitting curveballs when you 00:12:12.320 know a curveball is coming but really 00:12:14.560 what you need to get good at is the 00:12:16.639 Discrimination skills of interpreting in 00:12:19.560 a split second what type of pitch it is 00:12:22.360 and whether it's worth taking a swing at 00:12:24.480 so that's an example of including 00:12:26.760 helpful variation in the skill building 00:12:29.519 process so that what you develop are 00:12:31.480 those discrimination skills so that you 00:12:33.800 get good at recognizing when it's a 00:12:37.279 curveball or fast ball or knuckle ball 00:12:41.079 so this is an example of a physical 00:12:43.199 skill but the same applies to something 00:12:46.680 maybe more purely intellectual I think 00:12:49.480 an example given was someone who's 00:12:52.120 learning how to identify different birds 00:12:54.240 it's more helpful to study a variety of 00:12:57.519 birds to intermix the the type of birds 00:13:00.040 that you're identifying instead of 00:13:01.959 focusing on one species of bird at a 00:13:04.519 time because that focus on one species 00:13:07.320 at a time that's not true to the 00:13:09.399 experience that you'll have when you're 00:13:11.360 out on a hike listening and looking for 00:13:14.320 Birds it's the Discrimination skills 00:13:17.079 among different species that's more 00:13:18.920 important and more useful another 00:13:20.639 interesting example in this same realm 00:13:23.040 had to do with tossing a bag into a 00:13:27.240 bucket which isn't an actual ual game 00:13:29.320 but is close enough to cornhole which is 00:13:31.839 what I thought I would sketch out here 00:13:34.000 to make this point with one board over 00:13:36.920 here one about right here so when you're 00:13:41.720 playing cornhole the you know the range 00:13:45.399 of uh where where you are as the person 00:13:48.000 throwing is somewhere right around here 00:13:51.279 I think this is true just to the right 00:13:53.240 or just to the left of your board here 00:13:56.399 what they actually found was that it was 00:13:58.800 more useful to practice not exclusively 00:14:02.600 in this area but instead a little bit in 00:14:06.000 front of and a little bit behind where 00:14:09.120 you actually throw so practicing here or 00:14:12.920 back over here folks got better at 00:14:16.399 actually successfully throwing the bag 00:14:19.800 into the bucket even if the goal was to 00:14:22.399 get good at throwing it into the bucket 00:14:25.000 from a distance of 4 feet I think they 00:14:27.120 had two different groups one group 00:14:28.959 people only practiced at 4 feet the 00:14:31.959 other group practiced from 3 feet and 00:14:34.759 then from 5T and then they both had a 00:14:38.079 test where they saw how good they were 00:14:41.160 at throwing the bag into the bucket at 4 00:14:43.759 feet the folks who practiced at 3T and 00:14:46.560 5T were better at that task than the 00:14:49.320 folks who only practiced at 4 feet now 00:14:52.079 the implications for cornhole might not 00:14:54.360 be that interesting but think about free 00:14:56.759 throws if the results of that study are 00:14:59.240 repeatable that means if you're 00:15:01.360 practicing your free throw shots it will 00:15:03.440 be more helpful to practice in front of 00:15:05.440 the free throw line and behind the free 00:15:08.199 throw line and not just specifically in 00:15:11.279 that one spot where the free throw line 00:15:13.440 is that's pretty counterintuitive and I 00:15:16.040 don't know if there's any coach out 00:15:17.720 there that is actually practicing free 00:15:19.560 throws in that way encouraging their 00:15:21.120 players to so my hope there is that 00:15:24.240 those kind of extra examples give a 00:15:26.120 little bit more depth to these key IDE 00:15:28.639 ideas of focusing on retrieval instead 00:15:30.920 of review spacing out your learning 00:15:33.120 instead of cramming and making sure that 00:15:35.279 your learning activities are varied 00:15:37.120 instead of monotonous if we start to 00:15:39.720 think now about how that applies to the 00:15:42.120 development of your sketch noting skills 00:15:45.120 one implication is that you practice 00:15:47.680 drawing elements that are in your visual 00:15:50.720 vocabulary not by looking at a reference 00:15:53.839 but seeing if you can draw those things 00:15:55.399 from memory and then practice different 00:15:58.360 C categories of drawings and diagrams 00:16:01.720 together as opposed to just practicing 00:16:04.319 drawing people and then just practice 00:16:06.800 drawing notebooks and pens to maybe mix 00:16:10.000 up the category of drawings or diagrams 00:16:13.880 or writing styles because that's what 00:16:16.279 you'll be doing in a sketch noting 00:16:18.480 session you're not only going to be 00:16:20.519 drawing people or only writing words 00:16:23.040 you're going to be doing it all together 00:16:24.959 so weave that variation into your 00:16:27.120 practice I also think it's helpful to 00:16:29.079 think about what the creation of a 00:16:32.680 visual artifact like the one behind me 00:16:35.680 now what that facilitates in the future 00:16:38.399 as it relates to solidifying new 00:16:41.160 information and helping you apply 00:16:44.240 strategies or ideas you learned in the 00:16:46.399 future if you think about that retrieval 00:16:48.959 process I think it's easier to retrieve 00:16:51.920 a picture from your mind then it is a 00:16:55.120 bullet point list or key ideas within a 00:16:57.920 paragraph so one thing you might 00:17:00.240 practice retrieving from memory is 00:17:03.600 something like this full sketch note 00:17:06.240 that's what I enjoy doing especially 00:17:08.119 with the books that I read is if I'm out 00:17:10.880 on a walk or going for a run I find it 00:17:13.559 helpful and interesting to think about a 00:17:16.079 book that I've read in the past year or 00:17:18.119 past couple of years if I created this 00:17:20.439 sort of visual summary of it I try to 00:17:23.880 piece together that visual summary in my 00:17:26.199 mind as I'm pulling in those key 00:17:28.799 Concepts from the book and applying them 00:17:31.799 to what's going on in my life at that 00:17:34.280 moment I like to use books like these as 00:17:38.200 a lens through which to view my current 00:17:41.640 actions or the current thing that I'm 00:17:43.760 dealing with so I might ask myself what 00:17:46.480 would the book make it stick have to say 00:17:48.760 about the way that I'm teaching the 00:17:51.240 skill of sketch noting and encouraging 00:17:53.440 others to develop this skill what would 00:17:55.559 the book what works by Tara McMullan 00:17:57.880 have to say about how I'm thinking about 00:17:59.919 goal setting for 2024 what would the 00:18:02.480 book the psychology of money have to say 00:18:04.880 about how I'm thinking through my 00:18:06.640 financial decisions and while yes I 00:18:08.799 could simply review my past notes as I'm 00:18:12.960 thinking through those things I do like 00:18:15.320 the idea of being able to pull that from 00:18:17.840 my memory in the moment when I'm making 00:18:20.400 various decisions and having a visual 00:18:23.120 like this that I am over time kind of 00:18:26.520 embedding into my brain through spaced 00:18:29.559 retrieval I find that to be an 00:18:31.880 intriguing proposition and something 00:18:33.960 that's kind of fun to work toward if you 00:18:36.000 too would like to develop the skill of 00:18:38.080 sketching out ideas to deepen your 00:18:41.159 learning of the books you're reading or 00:18:43.360 podcast you're listening to conferences 00:18:45.720 you're attending I encourage you to 00:18:47.880 check out the resources at verbal to 00:18:49.640 visual.com there you can find a full 00:18:51.799 library of courses to get you up and 00:18:53.640 running with this skill and I hope that 00:18:55.400 you found this particular visual summary 00:18:57.840 to be use f for your own learning 00:19:00.039 perhaps your own teaching so I wish you 00:19:02.039 luck in implementing these ideas to 00:19:04.799 whatever skills or knowledge you're 00:19:06.679 developing right now and I look forward 00:19:08.520 to sketching out more interesting ideas 00:19:10.960 in the next video I'll see you then",

surprised to know 00:00:01.431 that the most popular learning methods 00:00:03.730 are some of the worstways to learn something. 00:00:05.770 In this video, I'm gonna share a summary 00:00:07.910 of the book, \"Make It Stick\", 00:00:09.400 and then share eight tipson how you could learn 00:00:11.810 and study correctly. 00:00:13.160 Let's get into it. 00:00:14.109 (upbeat music) 00:00:18.830 What's up everyone? 00:00:19.850 This is Brandon Hill 00:00:20.910 and welcome back to my channel 00:00:22.240 where we share content tohelp young professionals 00:00:25.000 develop personally,professionally and financially. 00:00:28.210 One series of this channelis analyzing popular books 00:00:31.610 and extracting the top takeaways 00:00:33.270 that you all should know about. 00:00:34.590 So be sure to check out my book reviews 00:00:36.510 and analysis playlist forother books that we've covered. 00:00:39.390 Let's jump into the summary. 00:00:40.717 \"Make It Stick\", gives readers 00:00:42.640 the holy grail of learning and memory. 00:00:45.140 This book draws on recent discoveries made 00:00:47.800 in cognitive psychologyand offers practical 00:00:50.344 and concrete techniques to learn faster, 00:00:53.730 learn more and forget less. 00:00:55.860 The authors share tons of facts 00:00:57.620 that are backed by research 00:00:58.724 and they give you actionable steps 00:01:00.730 that you could take to start implementing. 00:01:03.050 A big point made in \"Make It Stick\" 00:01:05.540 is that the best learning methods 00:01:07.400 are often counterintuitive. 00:01:08.920 This book will debunk 00:01:10.480 the most popular methods forlearning and memorization 00:01:13.530 and it'll equip you with the proper tools. 00:01:15.960 I would strongly recommend this book 00:01:17.630 to anybody who is interestedin learning more effectively 00:01:21.050 and more efficiently and using their brain 00:01:23.300 to their full capacity. 00:01:24.480 You could be a student or a professional 00:01:26.770 that's studying for a certification 00:01:28.770 or maybe just a lifelong learner. 00:01:30.340 But this book could help anybody out. 00:01:32.260 If you want to read, \"Make It Stick\", 00:01:33.880 I'll put a link down in the description 00:01:35.950 where you could access the book. 00:01:37.290 And if you want this book for free, 00:01:39.300 I'll also leave a link to a30 day free trial to Audible, 00:01:42.530 where you could sign upand have one free download. 00:01:44.750 Let's get into the eight tips now. 00:01:46.490 Number one is to avoidineffective learning methods, 00:01:49.930 such as highlighting, underlining, 00:01:52.510 and rereading notes and texts. 00:01:54.450 So some of the most commonstudy strategies out there 00:01:57.590 include highlighting, underlining 00:02:00.120 and rereading over and over again. 00:02:02.030 The authors of this book state 00:02:03.930 that although these arethe most popular methods, 00:02:06.260 they are some of theleast productive methods. 00:02:08.440 Highlighting and underliningare passive forms of learning 00:02:11.960 and don't result in durable memory. 00:02:13.870 Rereading your notes and textbooks 00:02:16.040 is also a form of passive learning 00:02:18.150 and it's extremely time consuming. 00:02:20.010 The authors talk about thatwhen you use these methods, 00:02:22.510 you could actually deceiveyourself into thinking 00:02:25.370 that you're grasping what you're reading, 00:02:26.970 but in actuality, whenyou're rereading notes 00:02:29.630 over and over again, all you'redoing is becoming familiar 00:02:32.890 with the text instead ofactually understanding 00:02:35.660 the underlying concepts. 00:02:37.140 Tip number two is toimplement retrieval practice. 00:02:40.570 One of the several effectivelearning strategies 00:02:42.950 that are shared is retrieval practice. 00:02:45.170 Simply put, retrieval practiceinvolves quizzing yourself. 00:02:48.750 You're recalling facts orconcepts from your memory. 00:02:51.970 For example, if you'rereading through a book, 00:02:54.290 you could stop in the middle of a section 00:02:56.100 and ask yourself, what did I just read? 00:02:58.250 This forces you to use your memory 00:03:00.270 and recall what you're learning. 00:03:01.780 Another example of retrieval practice 00:03:04.040 is the use of flashcards. 00:03:05.630 On one side of a flashcard,you have a question 00:03:08.140 and on the back, you have an answer. 00:03:09.950 When you study using flashcards, 00:03:11.690 you read the question and on the front 00:03:13.580 and you try to say the answerout loud or in your head 00:03:16.830 before you flip it over and check it. 00:03:18.640 The book mentions two profound benefits 00:03:21.160 of retrieval practice. 00:03:22.510 One is that it tells you what you do know 00:03:24.600 and what you don't know and therefore, 00:03:26.340 you know what to study and focus on. 00:03:28.210 Number two, recalling what you've learned, 00:03:30.450 causes the brain toreconsolidate a memory, 00:03:32.900 which strengthens its connection to things 00:03:35.260 that you already knowand it makes it easier 00:03:37.570 to recall it in the future. 00:03:38.980 So basically, yourmemory's becoming better 00:03:40.830 every time you do it. 00:03:41.770 Tip number three, embraceeffortful learning, 00:03:44.530 and stay away from easy learning. 00:03:46.780 One counterintuitiveinsight that the book states 00:03:49.690 is that learning isdeeper and more durable 00:03:52.720 when it's effortful. 00:03:53.910 Basically when learning is more difficult 00:03:55.970 and demands more brain power,it'll be more effective 00:03:59.020 and you'll have a bettermemory of that topic. 00:04:01.250 A quote from the book reads that 00:04:03.067 \"Learning that is easy ishere today and gone tomorrow.\" 00:04:06.550 When you study, you wantit to be challenging. 00:04:08.830 This may take longer, butyou'll learn better in the end. 00:04:11.810 In the previous tip, we talkedabout retrieval practice. 00:04:14.610 Combining tip number onewith retrieval practice 00:04:17.649 and this current tipwith effortful learning 00:04:19.940 results in another conceptcalled effortful retrieval. 00:04:23.460 For example, you mightcreate a flashcard deck 00:04:25.910 on a certain topic that you're studying 00:04:27.780 rather than practicing all the flashcards 00:04:29.694 that you know by heart, youshould focus on the flashcards 00:04:32.950 that are challenging toyou and take more effort 00:04:35.510 and brain power to recall. 00:04:36.990 When the mind has to work,the learning sticks better. 00:04:39.880 Tip number four, implementspace repetition. 00:04:43.430 Space repetition is a studying technique 00:04:46.000 that involves repeatedlyreviewing information 00:04:48.720 that you want to memorize 00:04:50.240 at gradually increasing time intervals. 00:04:52.710 The objective is to review material 00:04:55.070 just as you start to forget about it. 00:04:56.920 You practice space repetition 00:04:58.710 by studying something multiple times 00:05:00.780 while progressively increasing 00:05:02.410 the time between each session. 00:05:03.970 Imagine that you have 15financial formulas to memorize 00:05:07.450 for a test in the future. 00:05:08.720 You would start by studying 00:05:09.980 all 15 of those formulas on day one. 00:05:12.580 After the first timeyou study the formulas, 00:05:14.552 study again the next day, 00:05:16.610 then study the formulas four days later, 00:05:18.810 then again, seven days later and so forth 00:05:21.290 until the informationis permanently stored 00:05:23.560 in your long term memory. 00:05:24.920 Space repetition worksbecause the periodic practice 00:05:28.750 allows for a little bitof forgetting to happen. 00:05:31.020 This little bit of forgetting is good 00:05:33.010 because when you practice again, 00:05:34.670 it will be more difficult 00:05:36.040 for you to retrieve that information. 00:05:37.760 That's where the effortfulretrieval comes in, 00:05:39.820 that we just talked about. 00:05:40.870 The retrieval routes ofthe pathways in your brain 00:05:43.410 will strengthen and the material 00:05:45.130 will crystallize in your memory. 00:05:46.700 Number five is to implementinterleaved practice. 00:05:50.230 So it turns out that practicinga single concept or skill 00:05:53.073 over and over again,until you have it down, 00:05:55.880 isn't as effective asmixing up your practice 00:05:58.730 and varying it withother types of different, 00:06:01.280 but related problems. 00:06:02.580 To help illustrate what this means, 00:06:04.210 the authors give an exampleof studying geometry. 00:06:06.900 If you're studying geometry, 00:06:08.550 you shouldn't just practicea bunch of problems 00:06:10.228 that have you calculatethe area of a pyramid. 00:06:13.510 Instead, you shouldinterleave your practice. 00:06:15.810 And you could do this 00:06:16.760 by studying a varietyof geometry problems, 00:06:19.330 instead of just workingon practice problems, 00:06:21.460 where you calculate the area of a pyramid, 00:06:23.300 you could mix up other types of problems, 00:06:25.180 such as calculating thearea of a sphere or a cube 00:06:28.280 or a rectangle and mixing it all together. 00:06:30.640 And having those problems shuffled. 00:06:32.390 By mixing up the problem types 00:06:34.230 that you work on within a subject, 00:06:35.940 you'll become better at discriminating 00:06:37.710 between one problem type and another. 00:06:39.940 When given a problem,you'll be better equipped 00:06:42.100 to tell what type of problem it is 00:06:44.450 and how you should tackle that problem. 00:06:46.040 And this is beneficial 00:06:47.060 because this is how youwould encounter a problem 00:06:49.210 in real life or on an exam. 00:06:51.140 Number six is to reflectwhen learning new things. 00:06:54.420 In \"Make It Stick\", theauthors talk about reflection 00:06:57.260 being a form of practice. 00:06:58.830 Reflection can involveseveral cognitive activities 00:07:02.490 that can aid your learning and memory. 00:07:04.210 They include retrievingknowledge from memory, 00:07:06.710 connecting what you are thinkingabout to new experiences 00:07:09.840 and visualizing and mentally rehearsing 00:07:12.090 what you might do differently next time. 00:07:13.980 If you don't stop everynow and then to reflect, 00:07:16.330 you could be missing outon these critical benefits. 00:07:18.910 It might seem inefficient totake breaks for reflection, 00:07:22.090 but if you skip out on reflection 00:07:23.770 and you just continue readingyour notes and textbooks, 00:07:26.480 you may not fully absorb the material. 00:07:28.560 Also, if you're studying andyou get a question wrong, 00:07:31.450 reflect on why you got it wrong. 00:07:33.330 So you don't make that samemistake again next time. 00:07:35.600 Number seven is to focusand build upon the basics 00:07:38.650 while on the road to mastery. 00:07:40.390 The authors of \"Make ItStick\" talk about how mastery 00:07:42.937 in any field from cookingto chess to brain surgery 00:07:47.070 is a gradual accumulation of knowledge, 00:07:49.840 conceptual understanding,judgment and skill. 00:07:53.160 Mastery requires you to havethe possession of knowledge, 00:07:56.610 as well as a conceptual understanding 00:07:58.570 of how to use that knowledge. 00:07:59.960 Before you run, you needto learn how to walk. 00:08:02.420 And before you walk, youneed to learn how to crawl. 00:08:05.170 Crawling, when it comes to learning 00:08:07.360 is mastering the basicsand the fundamentals. 00:08:09.740 Don't try to advance too quickly 00:08:11.620 without learning the basics first. 00:08:13.490 Once you have the basics mastered, 00:08:15.420 you have a solid foundationto advance to the next level. 00:08:18.560 Finally, tip number eight. 00:08:20.700 Don't just acknowledge yourmistakes, but learn from them. 00:08:23.910 When learning is effortful 00:08:25.360 and you're using all of theseeffective study strategies, 00:08:28.250 you're going to make a lot of mistakes. 00:08:30.090 When studying, don't just check to see 00:08:32.280 if you got an answer wrong or not. 00:08:33.950 A mistake is an opportunityto learn and improve. 00:08:37.480 The book says that makingmistakes and learning from them, 00:08:40.809 builds bridges to advancedlevels of learning. 00:08:43.240 So see your mistakes as lessons. 00:08:45.450 Analyze what you got wrongand why you got it wrong. 00:08:48.250 If you can understand what ledyou to an incorrect answer, 00:08:51.410 you'll know not to makethat same mistake again. 00:08:53.780 That wraps up the eighttips on how to learn 00:08:55.970 and study correctly fromthe book, \"Make It Stick\". 00:08:58.810 And I highly recommend that you read it. 00:09:00.550 Again, to read this book, 00:09:02.060 I'll put a link in the description 00:09:03.750 for where you couldaccess the book on

surprised to know 00:00:01.431 that the most popular learning methods 00:00:03.730 are some of the worstways to learn something. 00:00:05.770 In this video, I'm gonna share a summary 00:00:07.910 of the book, \"Make It Stick\", 00:00:09.400 and then share eight tipson how you could learn 00:00:11.810 and study correctly. 00:00:13.160 Let's get into it. 00:00:14.109 (upbeat music) 00:00:18.830 What's up everyone? 00:00:19.850 This is Brandon Hill 00:00:20.910 and welcome back to my channel 00:00:22.240 where we share content tohelp young professionals 00:00:25.000 develop personally,professionally and financially. 00:00:28.210 One series of this channelis analyzing popular books 00:00:31.610 and extracting the top takeaways 00:00:33.270 that you all should know about. 00:00:34.590 So be sure to check out my book reviews 00:00:36.510 and analysis playlist forother books that we've covered. 00:00:39.390 Let's jump into the summary. 00:00:40.717 \"Make It Stick\", gives readers 00:00:42.640 the holy grail of learning and memory. 00:00:45.140 This book draws on recent discoveries made 00:00:47.800 in cognitive psychologyand offers practical 00:00:50.344 and concrete techniques to learn faster, 00:00:53.730 learn more and forget less. 00:00:55.860 The authors share tons of facts 00:00:57.620 that are backed by research 00:00:58.724 and they give you actionable steps 00:01:00.730 that you could take to start implementing. 00:01:03.050 A big point made in \"Make It Stick\" 00:01:05.540 is that the best learning methods 00:01:07.400 are often counterintuitive. 00:01:08.920 This book will debunk 00:01:10.480 the most popular methods forlearning and memorization 00:01:13.530 and it'll equip you with the proper tools. 00:01:15.960 I would strongly recommend this book 00:01:17.630 to anybody who is interestedin learning more effectively 00:01:21.050 and more efficiently and using their brain 00:01:23.300 to their full capacity. 00:01:24.480 You could be a student or a professional 00:01:26.770 that's studying for a certification 00:01:28.770 or maybe just a lifelong learner. 00:01:30.340 But this book could help anybody out. 00:01:32.260 If you want to read, \"Make It Stick\", 00:01:33.880 I'll put a link down in the description 00:01:35.950 where you could access the book. 00:01:37.290 And if you want this book for free, 00:01:39.300 I'll also leave a link to a30 day free trial to Audible, 00:01:42.530 where you could sign upand have one free download. 00:01:44.750 Let's get into the eight tips now. 00:01:46.490 Number one is to avoidineffective learning methods, 00:01:49.930 such as highlighting, underlining, 00:01:52.510 and rereading notes and texts. 00:01:54.450 So some of the most commonstudy strategies

toimplement retrieval practice. 00:02:40.570 One of the several effectivelearning strategies 00:02:42.950 that are shared is retrieval practice. 00:02:45.170 Simply put, retrieval practiceinvolves

and focus on. 00:03:28.210 Number two, recalling what you've learned, 00:03:30.450 causes the brain toreconsolidate a memory, 00:03:32.900 which strengthens its connection to things 00:03:35.260 that

00:04:08.830 This may take longer, butyou'll learn better in the end. 00:04:11.810 In the previous tip, we talkedabout retrieval practice. 00:04:14.610 Combining tip number onewith retrieval practice

00:05:00.780 while progressively increasing 00:05:02.410 the time between each session. 00:05:03.970 Imagine that you have 15financial formulas to memorize 00:05:07.450 for a test in the future. 00:05:08.720 You would start by studying 00:05:09.980 all 15 of those formulas on day one. 00:05:12.580 After the first timeyou study the formulas, 00:05:14.552 study again the next day, 00:05:16.610 then study the formulas four days later, 00:05:18.810 then again, seven days later and so forth 00:05:21.290 until the informationis permanently stored 00:05:23.560 in your long term memory. 00:05:24.920 Space repetition worksbecause the periodic practice 00:05:28.750 allows for a little bitof forgetting to happen. 00:05:31.020 This little bit of forgetting is good 00:05:33.010 because when you practice again, 00:05:34.670 it will be more difficult 00:05:36.040 for you to retrieve that information. 00:05:37.760 That's where the effortfulretrieval comes in, 00:05:39.820 that we just talked about. 00:05:40.870 The retrieval routes ofthe pathways in your brain 00:05:43.410 will strengthen and the material 00:05:45.130 will crystallize in your memory. 00:05:46.700 Number five is to implementinterleaved practice. 00:05:50.230 So it turns out that practicinga single concept or skill 00:05:53.073 over and over again,until you have it down, 00:05:55.880 isn't as effective asmixing up your practice 00:05:58.730 and varying it withother types of different, 00:06:01.280 but related problems. 00:06:02.580 To help illustrate what this means, 00:06:04.210 the authors give an exampleof studying geometry. 00:06:06.900 If you're studying geometry, 00:06:08.550 you shouldn't just practicea bunch of problems 00:06:10.228 that have you calculatethe area of a pyramid. 00:06:13.510 Instead, you shouldinterleave your practice. 00:06:15.810 And you could do this 00:06:16.760 by studying a varietyof geometry problems, 00:06:19.330 instead of just workingon practice problems, 00:06:21.460 where you calculate the area of a pyramid, 00:06:23.300 you could mix up other types of problems, 00:06:25.180 such as calculating thearea of a sphere or a cube 00:06:28.280 or a rectangle and mixing it all together. 00:06:30.640 And having those problems shuffled. 00:06:32.390 By mixing up the problem types 00:06:34.230 that you work on within a subject, 00:06:35.940 you'll become better at discriminating 00:06:37.710 between one problem type and another. 00:06:39.940 When given a problem,you'll be better equipped 00:06:42.100 to tell what type of problem it is 00:06:44.450 and how you should tackle that problem. 00:06:46.040 And this is beneficial 00:06:47.060 because this is how youwould encounter a problem 00:06:49.210 in real life or on an exam. 00:06:51.140 Number six is to reflectwhen learning new things. 00:06:54.420 In \"Make It Stick\", theauthors talk about reflection 00:06:57.260 being a form of practice. 00:06:58.830 Reflection can involveseveral cognitive activities 00:07:02.490 that can aid your learning and memory. 00:07:04.210 They include retrievingknowledge from memory, 00:07:06.710 connecting what you are thinkingabout to new experiences 00:07:09.840 and visualizing and mentally rehearsing 00:07:12.090 what you might do differently next time. 00:07:13.980 If you don't stop everynow and then to reflect, 00:07:16.330 you could be missing outon these critical benefits. 00:07:18.910 It might seem inefficient totake breaks for reflection, 00:07:22.090 but if you skip out on reflection 00:07:23.770 and you just continue readingyour notes and textbooks, 00:07:26.480 you may not fully absorb the material. 00:07:28.560 Also, if you're studying andyou get a question wrong, 00:07:31.450 reflect on why you got it wrong. 00:07:33.330 So you don't make that samemistake again next time. 00:07:35.600 Number seven is to focusand build upon the basics 00:07:38.650 while on the road to mastery. 00:07:40.390 The authors of \"Make ItStick\" talk about how mastery 00:07:42.937 in any field from cookingto chess to brain surgery 00:07:47.070 is a gradual accumulation of knowledge, 00:07:49.840 conceptual understanding,judgment and skill. 00:07:53.160 Mastery requires you to havethe possession of knowledge, 00:07:56.610 as well as a conceptual understanding 00:07:58.570 of how to use that knowledge. 00:07:59.960 Before you run, you needto learn how to walk. 00:08:02.420 And before you walk, youneed to learn how to crawl. 00:08:05.170 Crawling, when it comes to learning 00:08:07.360 is mastering the basicsand the fundamentals. 00:08:09.740 Don't try to advance too quickly 00:08:11.620 without learning the basics first. 00:08:13.490 Once you have the basics mastered, 00:08:15.420 you have a solid foundationto advance to the next level. 00:08:18.560 Finally, tip number eight. 00:08:20.700 Don't just acknowledge yourmistakes, but learn from them. 00:08:23.910 When learning is effortful 00:08:25.360 and you're using all of theseeffective study strategies, 00:08:28.250 you're going to make a lot of mistakes. 00:08:30.090 When studying, don't just check to see 00:08:32.280 if you got an answer wrong or not. 00:08:33.950 A mistake is an opportunityto learn and improve. 00:08:37.480 The book says that makingmistakes and learning from them, 00:08:40.809 builds bridges to advancedlevels of learning. 00:08:43.240 So see your mistakes as lessons. 00:08:45.450 Analyze what you got wrongand why you got it wrong. 00:08:48.250 If you can understand what ledyou to an incorrect answer, 00:08:51.410 you'll know not to makethat same mistake again. 00:08:53.780 That wraps up the eighttips on how to learn 00:08:55.970 and study correctly fromthe book, \"Make It Stick\". 00:08:58.810 And I highly recommend that you read it. 00:09:00.550 Again, to read this book, 00:09:02.060 I'll put a link in the description 00:09:03.750 for where you couldaccess the book on

surprised to know 00:00:01.431 that the most popular learning methods 00:00:03.730 are some of the worstways to learn something. 00:00:05.770 In this video, I'm gonna share a summary 00:00:07.910 of the book, \"Make It Stick\", 00:00:09.400 and then share eight tipson how you could learn 00:00:11.810 and study correctly. 00:00:13.160 Let's get into it. 00:00:14.109 (upbeat music) 00:00:18.830 What's up everyone? 00:00:19.850 This is Brandon Hill 00:00:20.910 and welcome back to my channel 00:00:22.240 where we share content tohelp young professionals 00:00:25.000 develop personally,professionally and financially. 00:00:28.210 One series of this channelis analyzing popular books 00:00:31.610 and extracting the top takeaways 00:00:33.270 that you all should know about. 00:00:34.590 So be sure to check out my book reviews 00:00:36.510 and analysis playlist forother books that we've covered. 00:00:39.390 Let's jump into the summary. 00:00:40.717 \"Make It Stick\", gives readers 00:00:42.640 the holy grail of learning and memory. 00:00:45.140 This book draws on recent discoveries made 00:00:47.800 in cognitive psychologyand offers practical 00:00:50.344 and concrete techniques to learn faster, 00:00:53.730 learn more and forget less. 00:00:55.860 The authors share tons of facts 00:00:57.620 that are backed by research 00:00:58.724 and they give you actionable steps 00:01:00.730 that you could take to start implementing. 00:01:03.050 A big point made in \"Make It Stick\" 00:01:05.540 is that the best learning methods 00:01:07.400 are often counterintuitive. 00:01:08.920 This book will debunk 00:01:10.480 the most popular methods forlearning and memorization 00:01:13.530 and it'll equip you with the proper tools. 00:01:15.960 I would strongly recommend this book 00:01:17.630 to anybody who is interestedin learning more effectively 00:01:21.050 and more efficiently and using their brain 00:01:23.300 to their full capacity. 00:01:24.480 You could be a student or a professional 00:01:26.770 that's studying for a certification 00:01:28.770 or maybe just a lifelong learner. 00:01:30.340 But this book could help anybody out. 00:01:32.260 If you want to read, \"Make It Stick\", 00:01:33.880 I'll put a link down in the description 00:01:35.950 where you could access the book. 00:01:37.290 And if you want this book for free, 00:01:39.300 I'll also leave a link to a30 day free trial to Audible, 00:01:42.530 where you could sign upand have one free download. 00:01:44.750 Let's get into the eight tips now. 00:01:46.490 Number one is to avoidineffective learning methods, 00:01:49.930 such as highlighting, underlining, 00:01:52.510 and rereading notes and texts. 00:01:54.450 So some of the most commonstudy strategies out there 00:01:57.590 include highlighting, underlining 00:02:00.120 and rereading over and over again. 00:02:02.030 The authors of this book state 00:02:03.930 that although these arethe most popular methods, 00:02:06.260 they are some of theleast productive methods. 00:02:08.440 Highlighting and underliningare passive forms of learning 00:02:11.960 and don't result in durable memory. 00:02:13.870 Rereading your notes and textbooks 00:02:16.040 is also a form of passive learning 00:02:18.150 and it's extremely time consuming. 00:02:20.010 The authors talk about thatwhen you use these methods, 00:02:22.510 you could actually deceiveyourself into thinking 00:02:25.370 that you're grasping what you're reading, 00:02:26.970 but in actuality, whenyou're rereading notes 00:02:29.630 over and over again, all you'redoing is becoming familiar 00:02:32.890 with the text instead ofactually understanding 00:02:35.660 the underlying concepts. 00:02:37.140 Tip number two is toimplement retrieval practice. 00:02:40.570 One of the several effectivelearning strategies 00:02:42.950 that are shared is retrieval practice. 00:02:45.170 Simply put, retrieval practiceinvolves quizzing yourself. 00:02:48.750 You're recalling facts orconcepts from your memory. 00:02:51.970 For example, if you'rereading through a book, 00:02:54.290 you could stop in the middle of a section 00:02:56.100 and ask yourself, what did I just read? 00:02:58.250 This forces you to use your memory 00:03:00.270 and recall what you're learning. 00:03:01.780 Another example of retrieval practice 00:03:04.040 is the use of flashcards. 00:03:05.630 On one side of a flashcard,you have a question 00:03:08.140 and on the back, you have an answer. 00:03:09.950 When you study using flashcards, 00:03:11.690 you read the question and on the front 00:03:13.580 and you try to say the answerout loud or in your head 00:03:16.830 before you flip it over and check it. 00:03:18.640 The book mentions two profound benefits 00:03:21.160 of retrieval practice. 00:03:22.510 One is that it tells you what you do know 00:03:24.600 and what you don't know and therefore, 00:03:26.340 you know what to study and focus on. 00:03:28.210 Number two, recalling what you've learned, 00:03:30.450 causes the brain toreconsolidate a memory, 00:03:32.900 which strengthens its connection to things 00:03:35.260 that you already knowand it makes it easier 00:03:37.570 to recall it in the future. 00:03:38.980 So basically, yourmemory's becoming better 00:03:40.830 every time you do it. 00:03:41.770 Tip number three, embraceeffortful learning, 00:03:44.530 and stay away from easy learning. 00:03:46.780 One counterintuitiveinsight that the book states 00:03:49.690 is that learning isdeeper and more durable 00:03:52.720 when it's effortful. 00:03:53.910 Basically when learning is more difficult 00:03:55.970 and demands more brain power,it'll be more effective 00:03:59.020 and you'll have a bettermemory of that topic. 00:04:01.250 A quote from the book reads that 00:04:03.067 \"Learning that is easy ishere today and gone tomorrow.\" 00:04:06.550 When you study, you wantit to be challenging. 00:04:08.830 This may take longer, butyou'll learn better in the end. 00:04:11.810 In the previous tip, we talkedabout retrieval practice. 00:04:14.610 Combining tip number onewith retrieval practice 00:04:17.649 and this current tipwith effortful learning 00:04:19.940 results in another conceptcalled effortful retrieval. 00:04:23.460 For example, you mightcreate a flashcard deck 00:04:25.910 on a certain topic that you're studying 00:04:27.780 rather than practicing all the flashcards 00:04:29.694 that you know by heart, youshould focus on the flashcards 00:04:32.950 that are challenging toyou and take more effort 00:04:35.510 and brain power to recall. 00:04:36.990 When the mind has to work,the learning sticks better. 00:04:39.880 Tip number four, implementspace repetition. 00:04:43.430 Space repetition is a studying technique 00:04:46.000 that involves repeatedlyreviewing information 00:04:48.720 that you want to memorize 00:04:50.240 at gradually increasing time intervals. 00:04:52.710 The objective is to review material 00:04:55.070 just as you start to forget about it. 00:04:56.920 You practice space repetition 00:04:58.710 by studying something multiple times 00:05:00.780 while progressively increasing 00:05:02.410 the time between each session. 00:05:03.970 Imagine that you have 15financial formulas to memorize 00:05:07.450 for a test in the future. 00:05:08.720 You would start by studying 00:05:09.980 all 15 of those formulas on day one. 00:05:12.580 After the first timeyou study the formulas, 00:05:14.552 study again the next day, 00:05:16.610 then study the formulas four days later, 00:05:18.810 then again, seven days later and so forth 00:05:21.290 until the informationis permanently stored 00:05:23.560 in your long term memory. 00:05:24.920 Space repetition worksbecause the periodic practice 00:05:28.750 allows for a little bitof forgetting to happen. 00:05:31.020 This little bit of forgetting is good 00:05:33.010 because when you practice again, 00:05:34.670 it will be more difficult 00:05:36.040 for you to retrieve that information. 00:05:37.760 That's where the effortfulretrieval comes in, 00:05:39.820 that we just talked about. 00:05:40.870 The retrieval routes ofthe pathways in your brain 00:05:43.410 will strengthen and the material 00:05:45.130 will crystallize in your memory. 00:05:46.700 Number five is to implementinterleaved practice. 00:05:50.230 So it turns out that practicinga single concept or skill 00:05:53.073 over and over again,until you have it down, 00:05:55.880 isn't as effective asmixing up your practice 00:05:58.730 and varying it withother types of different, 00:06:01.280 but related problems. 00:06:02.580 To help illustrate what this means, 00:06:04.210 the authors give an exampleof studying geometry. 00:06:06.900 If you're studying geometry, 00:06:08.550 you shouldn't just practicea bunch of problems 00:06:10.228 that have you calculatethe area of a pyramid. 00:06:13.510 Instead, you shouldinterleave your practice. 00:06:15.810 And you could do this 00:06:16.760 by studying a varietyof geometry problems, 00:06:19.330 instead of just workingon practice

00:06:51.140 Number six is to reflectwhen learning new things. 00:06:54.420 In \"Make It Stick\", theauthors talk about reflection 00:06:57.260 being a form of practice. 00:06:58.830 Reflection can involveseveral cognitive activities 00:07:02.490 that can aid your learning and memory. 00:07:04.210 They include retrievingknowledge from memory, 00:07:06.710 connecting what you are thinkingabout to new experiences 00:07:09.840 and visualizing and mentally rehearsing 00:07:12.090 what you might do differently next time. 00:07:13.980 If you don't stop everynow and then to reflect, 00:07:16.330 you

surprised to know 00:00:01.431 that the most popular learning methods 00:00:03.730 are some of the worstways to learn something. 00:00:05.770 In this video, I'm gonna share a summary 00:00:07.910 of the book, \"Make It Stick\", 00:00:09.400 and then share eight tipson how you could learn 00:00:11.810 and study correctly. 00:00:13.160 Let's get into it. 00:00:14.109 (upbeat music) 00:00:18.830 What's up everyone? 00:00:19.850 This is Brandon Hill 00:00:20.910 and welcome back to my channel 00:00:22.240 where we share content tohelp young professionals 00:00:25.000 develop personally,professionally and financially. 00:00:28.210 One series of this channelis analyzing popular books 00:00:31.610 and extracting the top takeaways 00:00:33.270 that you all should know about. 00:00:34.590 So be sure to check out my book reviews 00:00:36.510 and analysis playlist forother books that we've covered. 00:00:39.390 Let's jump into the summary. 00:00:40.717 \"Make It Stick\", gives readers 00:00:42.640 the holy grail of learning and memory. 00:00:45.140 This book draws on recent discoveries made 00:00:47.800 in cognitive psychologyand offers practical 00:00:50.344 and concrete techniques to learn faster, 00:00:53.730 learn more and forget less. 00:00:55.860 The authors share tons of facts 00:00:57.620 that are backed by research 00:00:58.724 and they give you actionable steps 00:01:00.730 that you could take to start implementing. 00:01:03.050 A big point made in \"Make It Stick\" 00:01:05.540 is that the best learning methods 00:01:07.400 are often counterintuitive. 00:01:08.920 This book will debunk 00:01:10.480 the most popular methods forlearning and memorization 00:01:13.530 and it'll equip you with the proper tools. 00:01:15.960 I would strongly recommend this book 00:01:17.630 to anybody who is interestedin learning more effectively 00:01:21.050 and more efficiently and using their brain 00:01:23.300 to their full capacity. 00:01:24.480 You could be a student or a professional 00:01:26.770 that's studying for a certification 00:01:28.770 or maybe just a lifelong learner. 00:01:30.340 But this book could help anybody out. 00:01:32.260 If you want to read, \"Make It Stick\", 00:01:33.880 I'll put a link down in the description 00:01:35.950 where you could access the book. 00:01:37.290 And if you want this book for free, 00:01:39.300 I'll also leave a link to a30 day free trial to Audible, 00:01:42.530 where you could sign upand have one free download. 00:01:44.750 Let's get into the eight tips now. 00:01:46.490 Number one is to avoidineffective learning methods, 00:01:49.930 such as highlighting, underlining, 00:01:52.510 and rereading notes and texts. 00:01:54.450 So some of the most commonstudy strategies out there 00:01:57.590 include highlighting, underlining 00:02:00.120 and rereading over and over again. 00:02:02.030 The authors of this book state 00:02:03.930 that although these arethe most popular methods, 00:02:06.260 they are some of theleast productive methods. 00:02:08.440 Highlighting and underliningare passive forms of learning 00:02:11.960 and don't result in durable memory. 00:02:13.870 Rereading your notes and textbooks 00:02:16.040 is also a form of passive learning 00:02:18.150 and it's extremely time consuming. 00:02:20.010 The authors talk about thatwhen you use these methods, 00:02:22.510 you could actually deceiveyourself into thinking 00:02:25.370 that you're grasping what you're reading, 00:02:26.970 but in actuality, whenyou're rereading notes 00:02:29.630 over and over again, all you'redoing is becoming familiar 00:02:32.890 with the text instead ofactually understanding 00:02:35.660 the underlying concepts. 00:02:37.140 Tip number two is toimplement retrieval practice. 00:02:40.570 One of the several effectivelearning strategies 00:02:42.950 that are shared is retrieval practice. 00:02:45.170 Simply put, retrieval practiceinvolves quizzing yourself. 00:02:48.750 You're recalling facts orconcepts from your memory. 00:02:51.970 For example, if you'rereading through a book, 00:02:54.290 you could stop in the middle of a section 00:02:56.100 and ask yourself, what did I just read? 00:02:58.250 This forces you to use your memory 00:03:00.270 and recall what you're learning. 00:03:01.780 Another example of retrieval practice 00:03:04.040 is the use of flashcards. 00:03:05.630 On one side of a flashcard,you have a question 00:03:08.140 and on the back, you have an answer. 00:03:09.950 When you study using flashcards, 00:03:11.690 you read the question and on the front 00:03:13.580 and you try to say the answerout loud or in your head 00:03:16.830 before you flip it over and check it. 00:03:18.640 The book mentions two profound benefits 00:03:21.160 of retrieval practice. 00:03:22.510 One is that it tells you what you do know 00:03:24.600 and what you don't know and therefore, 00:03:26.340 you know what to study and focus on. 00:03:28.210 Number two, recalling what you've learned, 00:03:30.450 causes the brain toreconsolidate a memory, 00:03:32.900 which strengthens its connection to things 00:03:35.260 that you already knowand it makes it easier 00:03:37.570 to recall it in the future. 00:03:38.980 So basically, yourmemory's becoming better 00:03:40.830 every time you do it. 00:03:41.770 Tip number three, embraceeffortful learning, 00:03:44.530 and stay away from easy learning. 00:03:46.780 One counterintuitiveinsight that the book states 00:03:49.690 is that learning isdeeper and more durable 00:03:52.720 when it's effortful. 00:03:53.910 Basically when learning is more difficult 00:03:55.970 and demands more brain power,it'll be more effective 00:03:59.020 and you'll have a bettermemory of that topic. 00:04:01.250 A quote from the book reads that 00:04:03.067 \"Learning that is easy ishere today and gone tomorrow.\" 00:04:06.550 When you study, you wantit to be challenging. 00:04:08.830 This may take longer, butyou'll learn better in the end. 00:04:11.810 In the previous tip, we talkedabout retrieval practice. 00:04:14.610 Combining tip number onewith retrieval practice 00:04:17.649 and this current tipwith effortful learning 00:04:19.940 results in another conceptcalled effortful retrieval. 00:04:23.460 For example, you mightcreate a flashcard deck 00:04:25.910 on a certain topic that you're studying 00:04:27.780 rather than practicing all the flashcards 00:04:29.694 that you know by heart, youshould focus on the flashcards 00:04:32.950 that are challenging toyou and take more effort 00:04:35.510 and brain power to recall. 00:04:36.990 When the mind has to work,the learning sticks better. 00:04:39.880 Tip number four, implementspace repetition. 00:04:43.430 Space repetition is a studying technique 00:04:46.000 that involves repeatedlyreviewing information 00:04:48.720 that you want to memorize 00:04:50.240 at gradually increasing time intervals. 00:04:52.710 The objective is to review material 00:04:55.070 just as you start to forget about it. 00:04:56.920 You practice space repetition 00:04:58.710 by studying something multiple times 00:05:00.780 while progressively increasing 00:05:02.410 the time between each session. 00:05:03.970 Imagine that you have 15financial formulas to memorize 00:05:07.450 for a test in the future. 00:05:08.720 You would start by studying 00:05:09.980 all 15 of those formulas on day one. 00:05:12.580 After the first timeyou study the formulas, 00:05:14.552 study again the next day, 00:05:16.610 then study the formulas four days later, 00:05:18.810 then again, seven days later and so forth 00:05:21.290 until the informationis permanently stored 00:05:23.560 in your long term memory. 00:05:24.920 Space repetition worksbecause the periodic practice 00:05:28.750 allows for a little bitof forgetting to happen. 00:05:31.020 This little bit of forgetting is good 00:05:33.010 because when you practice again, 00:05:34.670 it will be more difficult 00:05:36.040 for you to retrieve that information. 00:05:37.760 That's where the effortfulretrieval comes in, 00:05:39.820 that we just talked about. 00:05:40.870 The retrieval routes ofthe pathways in your brain 00:05:43.410 will strengthen and the material 00:05:45.130 will crystallize in your memory. 00:05:46.700 Number five is to implementinterleaved practice. 00:05:50.230 So it turns out that practicinga single concept or skill 00:05:53.073 over and over again,until you have it down, 00:05:55.880 isn't as effective asmixing up your practice 00:05:58.730 and varying it withother types of different, 00:06:01.280 but related problems. 00:06:02.580 To help illustrate what this means, 00:06:04.210 the authors give an exampleof studying geometry. 00:06:06.900 If you're studying geometry, 00:06:08.550 you shouldn't just practicea bunch of problems 00:06:10.228 that have you calculatethe area of a pyramid. 00:06:13.510 Instead, you shouldinterleave your practice. 00:06:15.810 And you could do this 00:06:16.760 by studying a varietyof geometry problems, 00:06:19.330 instead of just workingon practice problems, 00:06:21.460 where you calculate the area of a pyramid, 00:06:23.300 you could mix up other types of problems, 00:06:25.180 such as calculating thearea of a sphere or a cube 00:06:28.280 or a rectangle and mixing it all together. 00:06:30.640 And having those problems shuffled. 00:06:32.390 By mixing up the problem types 00:06:34.230 that you work on within a subject, 00:06:35.940 you'll become better at discriminating 00:06:37.710 between one problem type and another. 00:06:39.940 When given a problem,you'll be better equipped 00:06:42.100 to tell what type of problem it is 00:06:44.450 and how you should tackle that problem. 00:06:46.040 And this is beneficial 00:06:47.060 because this is how youwould encounter a problem 00:06:49.210 in real life or on an exam. 00:06:51.140 Number six is to reflectwhen learning new things. 00:06:54.420 In \"Make It Stick\", theauthors talk about reflection 00:06:57.260 being a form of practice. 00:06:58.830 Reflection can involveseveral cognitive activities 00:07:02.490 that can aid your learning and memory. 00:07:04.210 They include retrievingknowledge from memory, 00:07:06.710 connecting what you are thinkingabout to new experiences 00:07:09.840 and visualizing and mentally rehearsing 00:07:12.090 what you might do differently next time. 00:07:13.980 If you don't stop everynow and then to reflect, 00:07:16.330 you could be missing outon these critical benefits. 00:07:18.910 It might seem inefficient totake breaks for reflection, 00:07:22.090 but if you skip out on reflection 00:07:23.770 and you just continue readingyour notes and textbooks, 00:07:26.480 you may not fully absorb the material. 00:07:28.560 Also, if you're studying andyou get a question wrong, 00:07:31.450 reflect on why you got it wrong. 00:07:33.330 So you don't make that samemistake again next time. 00:07:35.600 Number seven is to focusand build upon the basics 00:07:38.650 while on the road to mastery. 00:07:40.390 The authors of \"Make ItStick\" talk about how mastery 00:07:42.937 in any field from cookingto chess to brain surgery 00:07:47.070 is a gradual accumulation of knowledge, 00:07:49.840 conceptual understanding,judgment and skill. 00:07:53.160 Mastery requires you to havethe possession of knowledge, 00:07:56.610 as well as a conceptual understanding 00:07:58.570 of how to use that knowledge. 00:07:59.960 Before you run, you needto learn how to walk. 00:08:02.420 And before you walk, youneed to learn how to crawl. 00:08:05.170 Crawling, when it comes to learning 00:08:07.360 is mastering the basicsand the fundamentals. 00:08:09.740 Don't try to advance too quickly 00:08:11.620 without learning the basics first. 00:08:13.490 Once you have the basics mastered, 00:08:15.420 you have a solid foundationto advance to the next level. 00:08:18.560 Finally, tip number eight. 00:08:20.700 Don't just acknowledge yourmistakes, but learn from them. 00:08:23.910 When learning is effortful 00:08:25.360 and you're using all of theseeffective study strategies, 00:08:28.250 you're going to make a lot of mistakes. 00:08:30.090 When studying, don't just check to see 00:08:32.280 if you got an answer wrong or not. 00:08:33.950 A mistake is an opportunityto learn and improve. 00:08:37.480 The book says that makingmistakes and learning from them, 00:08:40.809 builds bridges to advancedlevels of learning. 00:08:43.240 So see your mistakes as lessons. 00:08:45.450 Analyze what you got wrongand why you got it wrong. 00:08:48.250 If you can understand what ledyou to an incorrect answer, 00:08:51.410 you'll know not to makethat same mistake again. 00:08:53.780 That wraps up the eighttips on how to learn 00:08:55.970 and study correctly fromthe book, \"Make It Stick\". 00:08:58.810 And I highly recommend that you read it. 00:09:00.550 Again, to read this book, 00:09:02.060 I'll put a link in the description 00:09:03.750 for where you couldaccess the book on

popular methods, 00:02:06.260 they are some of theleast productive methods. 00:02:08.440 Highlighting and underliningare passive forms of learning 00:02:11.960 and don't result in durable memory. 00:02:13.870 Rereading your notes and textbooks 00:02:16.040 is also a form of passive learning 00:02:18.150 and it's extremely time consuming. 00:02:20.010 The authors talk about thatwhen you use these methods, 00:02:22.510 you could actually deceiveyourself into thinking 00:02:25.370 that you're grasping what you're reading, 00:02:26.970 but in actuality, whenyou're rereading notes 00:02:29.630 over and over again, all you'redoing is becoming familiar 00:02:32.890 with the text instead ofactually understanding 00:02:35.660 the underlying concepts. 00:02:37.140 Tip number two is toimplement retrieval practice. 00:02:40.570 One of the several effectivelearning strategies 00:02:42.950 that are shared is retrieval practice. 00:02:45.170 Simply put, retrieval practiceinvolves quizzing yourself. 00:02:48.750 You're recalling facts orconcepts from your memory. 00:02:51.970 For example, if you'rereading through a book, 00:02:54.290 you could stop in the middle of a section 00:02:56.100 and ask yourself, what did I just read? 00:02:58.250 This forces you to use your memory 00:03:00.270 and recall what you're learning. 00:03:01.780 Another example of retrieval practice 00:03:04.040 is the use of flashcards. 00:03:05.630 On one side of a flashcard,you have a question 00:03:08.140 and on the back, you have an answer. 00:03:09.950 When you study using flashcards, 00:03:11.690 you read the question and on the front 00:03:13.580 and you try to say the answerout loud or in your head 00:03:16.830 before you flip it over and check it. 00:03:18.640 The book mentions two profound benefits 00:03:21.160 of retrieval practice. 00:03:22.510 One is that it tells you what you do know 00:03:24.600 and what you don't know and therefore, 00:03:26.340 you know what to study and focus on. 00:03:28.210 Number two, recalling what you've learned, 00:03:30.450 causes the brain toreconsolidate a memory, 00:03:32.900 which strengthens its connection to things 00:03:35.260 that you already knowand it makes it easier 00:03:37.570 to recall it in the future. 00:03:38.980 So basically, yourmemory's becoming better 00:03:40.830 every time you do it. 00:03:41.770 Tip number three, embraceeffortful learning, 00:03:44.530 and stay away from easy learning. 00:03:46.780 One counterintuitiveinsight that the book states 00:03:49.690 is that learning isdeeper and more durable 00:03:52.720 when it's effortful. 00:03:53.910 Basically when learning is more difficult 00:03:55.970 and demands more brain power,it'll be more effective 00:03:59.020 and you'll have a bettermemory of that topic. 00:04:01.250 A quote from the book reads that 00:04:03.067 \"Learning that is easy ishere today and gone tomorrow.\" 00:04:06.550 When you study, you wantit to be challenging. 00:04:08.830 This may take longer, butyou'll learn better in the end. 00:04:11.810 In the previous tip, we talkedabout retrieval practice. 00:04:14.610 Combining tip number onewith retrieval practice 00:04:17.649 and this current tipwith effortful learning 00:04:19.940 results in another conceptcalled effortful retrieval. 00:04:23.460 For example, you mightcreate a flashcard deck 00:04:25.910 on a certain topic that you're studying 00:04:27.780 rather than practicing all the flashcards 00:04:29.694 that you know by heart, youshould focus on the flashcards 00:04:32.950 that are challenging toyou and take more effort 00:04:35.510 and brain power to recall. 00:04:36.990 When the mind has to work,the learning sticks better. 00:04:39.880 Tip number four, implementspace repetition. 00:04:43.430 Space repetition is a studying technique 00:04:46.000 that involves repeatedlyreviewing information 00:04:48.720 that you want to memorize 00:04:50.240 at gradually increasing time intervals. 00:04:52.710 The objective is to review material 00:04:55.070 just as you start to forget about it. 00:04:56.920 You practice space repetition 00:04:58.710 by studying something multiple times 00:05:00.780 while progressively increasing 00:05:02.410 the time between each session. 00:05:03.970 Imagine that you have 15financial formulas to memorize 00:05:07.450 for a test in the future. 00:05:08.720 You would start by studying 00:05:09.980 all 15 of those formulas on day one. 00:05:12.580 After the first timeyou study the formulas, 00:05:14.552 study again the next day, 00:05:16.610 then study the formulas four days later, 00:05:18.810 then again, seven days later and so forth 00:05:21.290 until the informationis permanently stored 00:05:23.560 in your long term memory. 00:05:24.920 Space repetition worksbecause the periodic practice 00:05:28.750 allows for a little bitof forgetting to happen. 00:05:31.020 This little bit of forgetting is good 00:05:33.010 because when you practice again, 00:05:34.670 it will be more difficult 00:05:36.040 for you to retrieve that information. 00:05:37.760 That's where the effortfulretrieval comes in, 00:05:39.820 that we just talked about. 00:05:40.870 The retrieval routes ofthe pathways in your brain 00:05:43.410 will strengthen and the material 00:05:45.130 will crystallize in your memory. 00:05:46.700 Number five is to implementinterleaved practice. 00:05:50.230 So it turns out that practicinga single concept or skill 00:05:53.073 over and over again,until you have it down, 00:05:55.880 isn't as effective asmixing up your practice 00:05:58.730 and varying it withother types of different, 00:06:01.280 but related problems. 00:06:02.580 To help illustrate what this means, 00:06:04.210 the authors give an exampleof studying geometry. 00:06:06.900 If you're studying geometry, 00:06:08.550 you shouldn't just practicea bunch of problems 00:06:10.228 that have you calculatethe area of a pyramid. 00:06:13.510 Instead, you shouldinterleave your practice. 00:06:15.810 And you could do this 00:06:16.760 by studying a varietyof geometry problems, 00:06:19.330 instead of just workingon practice problems, 00:06:21.460 where you calculate the area of a pyramid, 00:06:23.300 you could mix up other types of problems, 00:06:25.180 such as calculating thearea of a sphere or a cube 00:06:28.280 or a rectangle and mixing it all together. 00:06:30.640 And having those problems shuffled. 00:06:32.390 By mixing up the problem types 00:06:34.230 that you work on within a subject, 00:06:35.940 you'll become better at discriminating 00:06:37.710 between one problem type and another. 00:06:39.940 When given a problem,you'll be better equipped 00:06:42.100 to tell what type of problem it is 00:06:44.450 and how you should tackle that problem. 00:06:46.040 And this is beneficial 00:06:47.060 because this is how youwould encounter a problem 00:06:49.210 in real life or on an exam. 00:06:51.140 Number six is to reflectwhen learning new things. 00:06:54.420 In \"Make It Stick\", theauthors talk about reflection 00:06:57.260 being a form of practice. 00:06:58.830 Reflection can involveseveral cognitive activities 00:07:02.490 that can aid your learning and memory. 00:07:04.210 They include retrievingknowledge from memory, 00:07:06.710 connecting what you are thinkingabout to new experiences 00:07:09.840 and visualizing and mentally rehearsing 00:07:12.090 what you might do differently next time. 00:07:13.980 If you don't stop everynow and then to reflect, 00:07:16.330 you could be missing outon these critical benefits. 00:07:18.910 It might seem inefficient totake breaks for reflection, 00:07:22.090 but if you skip out on reflection 00:07:23.770 and you just continue readingyour notes and textbooks, 00:07:26.480 you may not fully absorb the material. 00:07:28.560 Also, if you're studying andyou get a question wrong, 00:07:31.450 reflect on why you got it wrong. 00:07:33.330 So you don't make that samemistake again next time. 00:07:35.600 Number seven is to focusand build upon the basics 00:07:38.650 while on the road to mastery. 00:07:40.390 The authors of \"Make ItStick\" talk about how mastery 00:07:42.937 in any field from cookingto chess to brain surgery 00:07:47.070 is a gradual accumulation of knowledge, 00:07:49.840 conceptual understanding,judgment and skill. 00:07:53.160 Mastery requires you to havethe possession of knowledge, 00:07:56.610 as well as a conceptual understanding 00:07:58.570 of how to use that knowledge. 00:07:59.960 Before you run, you needto learn how to walk. 00:08:02.420 And before you walk, youneed to learn how to crawl. 00:08:05.170 Crawling, when it comes to learning 00:08:07.360 is mastering the basicsand the fundamentals. 00:08:09.740 Don't try to advance too quickly 00:08:11.620 without learning the basics first. 00:08:13.490 Once you have the basics mastered, 00:08:15.420 you have a solid foundationto advance to the next level. 00:08:18.560 Finally, tip number eight. 00:08:20.700 Don't just acknowledge yourmistakes, but learn from them. 00:08:23.910 When learning is effortful 00:08:25.360 and you're using all of theseeffective study strategies, 00:08:28.250 you're going to make a lot of mistakes. 00:08:30.090 When studying, don't just check to see 00:08:32.280 if you got an answer wrong or not. 00:08:33.950 A mistake is an opportunityto learn and improve. 00:08:37.480 The book says that makingmistakes and learning from them, 00:08:40.809 builds bridges to advancedlevels of learning. 00:08:43.240 So see your mistakes as lessons. 00:08:45.450 Analyze what you got wrongand why you got it wrong. 00:08:48.250 If you can understand what ledyou to an incorrect answer, 00:08:51.410 you'll know not to makethat same mistake again. 00:08:53.780 That wraps up the eighttips on how to learn 00:08:55.970 and study correctly fromthe book, \"Make It Stick\". 00:08:58.810 And I highly recommend that you read it. 00:09:00.550 Again, to read this book, 00:09:02.060 I'll put a link in the description 00:09:03.750 for where you couldaccess the book on Amazon 00:09:05.960 and if you want this book for free, 00:09:07.620 I'll also leave a link in the description 00:09:09.750 for 30 day free trial to Audible, 00:09:11.830 where you could get one freedownload when you sign up. 00:09:14.100 In the meantime, I'll get workingon the next video for you. 00:09:17.150 I'll see you then.",

                "content": "# tactiq.io free youtube transcript # Learn ANYTHING quickly (using the latest science) with this life changing book # https://www.youtube.com/watch/MwgWnuSlybY 00:00:00.440 this book could change your life I know 00:00:02.480 that sounds like clickbait but it's true 00:00:04.640 this book teaches you how to learn and 00:00:06.359 that is such a fundamentally important 00:00:08.200 skill to excel at anything you have to 00:00:10.120 be able to learn but for some reason 00:00:11.880 it's a skill that's rarely taught and I 00:00:14.280 don't really understand why I'm going to 00:00:16.000 share this book with you I'm going to 00:00:17.439 give you a brief summary of what it 00:00:18.600 contains and tell you what I like about 00:00:21.039 it and what I don't like so much and 00:00:23.439 then you can decide whether or not it's 00:00:24.640 the right book for you I'll also give 00:00:26.480 you three learning techniques from the 00:00:28.160 book which will definitely improve your 00:00:30.439 learning and the other thing that I want 00:00:32.279 to do is compare this book with this 00:00:35.559 book which if you watch the channel 00:00:37.280 regularly you will have seen me talk 00:00:38.840 about this is a great book on learning 00:00:40.920 and I still like this book very much but 00:00:42.879 how does it compare to this one well 00:00:44.920 keep watching to find out you know when 00:00:47.559 you cram for a test and then shortly 00:00:49.079 afterwards forget everything that you've 00:00:50.680 learned and don't tell me that you've 00:00:52.600 never done that before uh chapter one is 00:00:55.000 all about that and it explains the 00:00:56.680 difference between working memory which 00:00:58.760 is if you know how Compu computers work 00:01:00.440 it's a bit like Ram it's the memory that 00:01:02.519 you use whilst you're thinking and it 00:01:04.199 Compares that to long-term memory and it 00:01:06.479 explains that to learn you have to move 00:01:09.080 information from your working memory to 00:01:10.880 your long-term memory and it discusses 00:01:12.640 ways of doing that it also talks about 00:01:14.400 how working memory can give the illusion 00:01:16.360 of learning and how it deceives you into 00:01:17.960 thinking that you've learned something 00:01:19.320 so you know when you're reading a 00:01:20.479 textbook and you go through it and you 00:01:22.200 think yeah yeah yeah I know how to do 00:01:23.520 that you go through the worked example 00:01:25.159 just quickly and you have a sense that 00:01:27.040 you understand it but then when you go 00:01:28.439 back to it perhaps the next day 00:01:30.520 you can't remember anything about it or 00:01:32.000 you don't know how to do it that's 00:01:33.360 because your working memory has fooled 00:01:34.720 you into thinking that you've learned it 00:01:35.960 when you haven't really so chapter one 00:01:37.960 sort of introduces that topic chapter 00:01:40.439 one talks about the limitations of 00:01:41.920 working memory and your working memory 00:01:43.840 is really quite limited and it uses the 00:01:45.960 analogy of an octopus with four 00:01:47.880 tentacles that can only hold four things 00:01:50.200 at once and it introduces methods that 00:01:52.600 you can use to move information from 00:01:54.759 your working memory to your long-term 00:01:56.399 memory chapter 2 goes into working 00:01:58.600 memory in a little bit more Det detail 00:02:00.439 and it discusses the effects that 00:02:02.200 working memory can have on your ability 00:02:04.079 to learn and it talks about two types of 00:02:06.320 people the race car driver who have 00:02:08.520 pretty good working memories and then 00:02:10.080 the hiker whose working memories aren't 00:02:12.480 quite so good and it's true that if you 00:02:14.319 don't have a great working memory then 00:02:16.160 you can find it more difficult to learn 00:02:19.040 that's the bad news but the good news is 00:02:21.000 that your long-term memory is pretty 00:02:22.840 much Limitless and if you don't have 00:02:25.440 such a good working memory you can use 00:02:27.160 strategies that will enable your 00:02:28.920 long-term memory to kick in so I think 00:02:31.480 this is one of the strengths of the book 00:02:32.879 because if you have a poor working 00:02:34.480 memory you can easily be written off as 00:02:36.760 someone that can't learn particularly 00:02:38.560 well but these methods will ensure that 00:02:40.519 you can learn as well or in some cases 00:02:43.360 even better than people who have really 00:02:45.800 good working memories chapter 3 explains 00:02:47.760 how your brain works obviously not 00:02:50.040 completely but what it does do is tell 00:02:51.680 you how information goes from the 00:02:53.000 working memory to the long-term memory 00:02:55.440 and that's in the neocortex and what 00:02:57.440 role the hippocampus plays in that I 00:02:59.519 didn't know much about these processes 00:03:01.080 so it was useful to me it also has some 00:03:03.360 practical use because it makes you more 00:03:05.080 aware of things like why sleep is 00:03:07.400 important when it comes to transferring 00:03:09.480 information from your working memory to 00:03:11.159 your long-term memory chapter four 00:03:12.760 discusses a really important topic 00:03:15.000 procrastination how to avoid it and how 00:03:17.360 to overcome it it also talks about the 00:03:19.400 brain's two methods of concentration 00:03:21.360 focused and diffuse and how 00:03:23.640 understanding those can help you to 00:03:25.200 optimize your own learning essentially 00:03:27.200 you work in Focus mode until you become 00:03:28.840 frustrated with something you can't do 00:03:30.319 anymore and then you rest so that your 00:03:32.080 brain can make sense of what's going on 00:03:33.760 the book also discusses two learning 00:03:35.319 Pathways the declarative pathway and the 00:03:37.360 procedural pathway declarative is when 00:03:39.959 you intentionally learn something like I 00:03:41.879 don't know studying Latin vocab and the 00:03:44.239 procedural pathway is when you learn how 00:03:46.799 to ride a bike usually you can explain 00:03:49.080 the declarative process but you can't 00:03:51.200 explain the procedural one and to learn 00:03:53.200 something well you need to use both 00:03:54.760 Pathways what did I like about the book 00:03:57.159 definitely the information that it 00:03:58.439 contains it's all based based on 00:04:00.000 scientific evidence and it's explained 00:04:01.720 in a very accessible style was there 00:04:03.519 anything that I didn't like sometimes 00:04:05.640 that accessible style moves a little bit 00:04:08.040 too close I think to being simplistic 00:04:11.239 but that only happens every now and then 00:04:12.840 and I do understand that they're aiming 00:04:14.360 this book at a very wide market so if 00:04:16.759 you own this book make it stick is it 00:04:18.798 worth getting this one there's quite a 00:04:21.160 lot of overlap between these two books 00:04:23.040 this book's far more recent it was 00:04:24.560 published a couple of years ago and this 00:04:26.960 one is getting on for 10 years old now 00:04:29.400 but they're both based on science this 00:04:32.199 one goes more into how the brain works 00:04:36.400 but they cover a lot of the same ground 00:04:38.520 if you're just looking for practical 00:04:39.639 learning techniques then you only need 00:04:41.400 one or the other but if you're 00:04:42.880 interested in learning in general then 00:04:44.840 you know you might as well get them both 00:04:46.280 this book does cover ground that this 00:04:47.880 one doesn't so here are some learning 00:04:49.639 techniques from the book that you can 00:04:50.919 use today number one retrieval practice 00:04:53.600 this is the most effective learning 00:04:55.039 technique known to science we learn more 00:04:57.240 when we attempt to retrieve information 00:04:58.840 from our brains so if you want to learn 00:05:01.039 something test yourself just keep 00:05:03.440 testing yourself and when I've mentioned 00:05:04.880 this in the past in other videos I've 00:05:06.919 had people in the comments saying oh but 00:05:08.400 that's just rot learning it's not 00:05:11.039 retrieval practice I.E testing yourself 00:05:13.840 improves memory and understanding you 00:05:16.720 will understand a topic better and 00:05:18.479 remember more about it if you test 00:05:20.520 yourself on it and also if those tests 00:05:22.560 become more difficult and try to link it 00:05:24.680 into information and knowledge that you 00:05:26.319 already have how does this subject a 00:05:28.639 link with subject B what does it mean 00:05:30.280 for subject C ask yourself questions 00:05:32.440 about it from lots of different angles 00:05:34.680 spaced practice is when you have a gap 00:05:36.440 between study sessions so if you're 00:05:38.160 going to study something for I don't 00:05:39.520 know 5 hours instead of doing 5 hours in 00:05:41.880 one day you're better doing five hours 00:05:43.880 across five days you also get the added 00:05:46.080 bonus that when you come to the next 00:05:47.639 session you can use retrieval practice 00:05:49.840 to remember what you covered in the 00:05:51.440 first session method three is inter 00:05:53.400 leaving now that's where instead of 00:05:55.280 studying the same topic within a subject 00:05:57.720 in blocks you mix up the topics so for 00:06:01.120 an example if you were studying physics 00:06:03.639 and you were doing Newton's laws of 00:06:05.479 motion instead of answering lots and 00:06:07.599 lots and lots of questions on Newton's 00:06:09.319 Laws of Motion it's more effective to 00:06:11.680 mix it up with say Newton's Laws of 00:06:14.080 gravitation and perhaps circular motion 00:06:16.960 and the reason is this if you're just 00:06:18.840 doing a lot of questions on Laws of 00:06:20.840 Motion you don't have to think deeply 00:06:23.039 about how you answer that particular 00:06:25.080 question because you know it's a Laws of 00:06:27.000 Motion question whereas if you mix it up 00:06:29.520 up you have to recognize which method 00:06:32.240 that you need to use because you have to 00:06:33.919 first categorize that problem and that 00:06:36.479 categorizing of the problem helps you to 00:06:38.599 see the nuances and the differences and 00:06:40.919 similarities between different topics 00:06:43.240 within a subject so interleaving is a 00:06:45.639 very effective method and it's been 00:06:47.120 shown by lots of research to be far more 00:06:49.759 effective than just doing lots of one 00:06:52.039 thing and then lots of another thing and 00:06:53.919 it's not just in physics it's been shown 00:06:55.440 to be effective in lots of different 00:06:57.000 subjects as well two other bits of 00:06:58.639 advice EX exercise helps learning and so 00:07:01.240 does sleep a lot of the topics I talk 00:07:04.039 about in this video are difficult to 00:07:06.080 learn but there's a free and easy way to 00:07:09.000 help you grasp them

00:00:00.440 this book could change your life I know 00:00:02.480 that sounds like clickbait but it's true 00:00:04.640 this book teaches you how to learn and 00:00:06.359 that is such a fundamentally important 00:00:08.200 skill to excel at anything you have to 00:00:10.120 be able to learn but for some reason 00:00:11.880 it's a skill that's rarely taught and I 00:00:14.280 don't really understand why I'm going to 00:00:16.000 share this book with you I'm going to 00:00:17.439 give you a brief summary of what it 00:00:18.600 contains and tell you what I like about 00:00:21.039 it and what I don't like so much and 00:00:23.439 then you can decide whether or not it's 00:00:24.640 the right book for you I'll also give 00:00:26.480 you three learning techniques from the 00:00:28.160 book which will definitely improve your 00:00:30.439 learning and the other thing that I want 00:00:32.279 to do is compare this book with this 00:00:35.559 book which if you watch the channel 00:00:37.280 regularly you will have seen me talk 00:00:38.840 about this is a great book on learning 00:00:40.920 and I still like this book very much but 00:00:42.879 how does it compare to this one well 00:00:44.920 keep watching to find out you know when 00:00:47.559 you cram for a test and then shortly 00:00:49.079 afterwards forget everything that you've 00:00:50.680 learned and don't tell me that you've 00:00:52.600 never done that before uh chapter one is 00:00:55.000 all about that and it explains the 00:00:56.680 difference between working memory which 00:00:58.760 is if you know how Compu computers work 00:01:00.440 it's a bit like Ram it's the memory that 00:01:02.519 you use whilst you're thinking and it 00:01:04.199 Compares that to long-term memory and it 00:01:06.479 explains that to learn you have to move 00:01:09.080 information from your working memory to 00:01:10.880 your long-term memory and it discusses 00:01:12.640 ways of doing that it also talks about 00:01:14.400 how working memory can give the illusion 00:01:16.360 of learning and how it deceives you into 00:01:17.960 thinking that you've learned something 00:01:19.320 so you know when you're reading a 00:01:20.479 textbook and you go through it and you 00:01:22.200 think yeah yeah yeah I know how to do 00:01:23.520 that you go through the worked example 00:01:25.159 just quickly and you have a sense that 00:01:27.040 you understand it but then when you go 00:01:28.439 back to it perhaps the next day 00:01:30.520 you can't remember anything about it or 00:01:32.000 you don't know how to do it that's 00:01:33.360 because your working memory has fooled 00:01:34.720 you into thinking that you've learned it 00:01:35.960 when you haven't really so chapter one 00:01:37.960 sort of introduces that topic chapter 00:01:40.439 one talks about the limitations of 00:01:41.920 working memory and your working memory 00:01:43.840 is really quite limited and it uses the 00:01:45.960 analogy of an octopus with four 00:01:47.880 tentacles that can only hold four things 00:01:50.200 at once and it introduces methods that 00:01:52.600 you can use to move information from 00:01:54.759 your working memory to your long-term 00:01:56.399 memory chapter 2 goes into working 00:01:58.600 memory in a little bit more Det detail 00:02:00.439 and it discusses the effects that 00:02:02.200 working memory can have on your ability 00:02:04.079 to learn and it talks about two types of 00:02:06.320 people the race car driver who have 00:02:08.520 pretty good working memories and then 00:02:10.080 the hiker whose working memories aren't 00:02:12.480 quite so good and it's true that if you 00:02:14.319 don't have a great working memory then 00:02:16.160 you can find it more difficult to learn 00:02:19.040 that's the bad news but the good news is 00:02:21.000 that your long-term memory is pretty 00:02:22.840 much Limitless and if you don't have 00:02:25.440 such a good working memory you can use 00:02:27.160 strategies that will enable your 00:02:28.920 long-term memory to kick in so I think 00:02:31.480 this is one of the strengths of the book 00:02:32.879 because if you have a poor working 00:02:34.480 memory you can easily be written off as 00:02:36.760 someone that can't learn particularly 00:02:38.560 well but these methods will ensure that 00:02:40.519 you can learn as well or in some cases 00:02:43.360 even better than people who have really 00:02:45.800 good working memories chapter 3 explains 00:02:47.760 how your brain works obviously not 00:02:50.040 completely but what it does do is tell 00:02:51.680 you how information goes from the 00:02:53.000 working memory to the long-term memory 00:02:55.440 and that's in the neocortex and what 00:02:57.440 role the hippocampus plays in that I 00:02:59.519 didn't know much about these processes 00:03:01.080 so it was useful to me it also has some 00:03:03.360 practical use because it makes you more 00:03:05.080 aware of things like why sleep is 00:03:07.400 important when it comes to transferring 00:03:09.480 information from your working memory to 00:03:11.159 your long-term memory chapter four 00:03:12.760 discusses a really important topic 00:03:15.000 procrastination how to avoid it and how 00:03:17.360 to overcome it it also talks about the 00:03:19.400 brain's two methods of concentration 00:03:21.360 focused and diffuse and how 00:03:23.640 understanding those can help you to 00:03:25.200 optimize your own learning essentially 00:03:27.200 you work in Focus mode until you become 00:03:28.840 frustrated with something you can't do 00:03:30.319 anymore and then you rest so that your 00:03:32.080 brain can make sense of what's going on 00:03:33.760 the book also discusses two learning 00:03:35.319 Pathways the declarative pathway and the 00:03:37.360 procedural pathway declarative is when 00:03:39.959 you intentionally learn something like I 00:03:41.879 don't know studying Latin vocab and the 00:03:44.239 procedural pathway is when you learn how 00:03:46.799 to ride a bike usually you can explain 00:03:49.080 the declarative process but you can't 00:03:51.200 explain the procedural one and to learn 00:03:53.200 something well you need to use both 00:03:54.760 Pathways what did I like about the book 00:03:57.159 definitely the information that it 00:03:58.439 contains it's all based based on 00:04:00.000 scientific evidence and it's explained 00:04:01.720 in a very accessible style was there 00:04:03.519 anything that I didn't like sometimes 00:04:05.640 that accessible style moves a little bit 00:04:08.040 too close I think to being simplistic 00:04:11.239 but that only happens every now and then 00:04:12.840 and I do understand that they're aiming 00:04:14.360 this book at a very wide market so if 00:04:16.759 you own this book make it stick is it 00:04:18.798 worth getting this one there's quite a 00:04:21.160 lot of overlap between these two books 00:04:23.040 this book's far more recent it was 00:04:24.560 published a couple of years ago and this 00:04:26.960 one is getting on for 10 years old now 00:04:29.400 but they're both based on science this 00:04:32.199 one goes more into how the brain works 00:04:36.400 but they cover a lot of the same ground 00:04:38.520 if you're just looking for practical 00:04:39.639 learning techniques then you only need 00:04:41.400 one or the other but if you're 00:04:42.880 interested in learning in general then 00:04:44.840 you know you might as well get them both 00:04:46.280 this book does cover ground that this 00:04:47.880 one doesn't so here are some learning 00:04:49.639 techniques from the book that you can 00:04:50.919 use today number one retrieval practice 00:04:53.600 this is the most effective learning 00:04:55.039 technique known to science we learn more 00:04:57.240 when we attempt to retrieve information 00:04:58.840 from our brains so if you want to learn 00:05:01.039 something test yourself just keep 00:05:03.440 testing yourself and when I've mentioned 00:05:04.880 this in the past in other videos I've 00:05:06.919 had people in the comments saying oh but 00:05:08.400 that's just rot learning it's not 00:05:11.039 retrieval practice I.E testing yourself 00:05:13.840 improves memory and understanding you 00:05:16.720 will understand a topic better and 00:05:18.479 remember more about it if you test 00:05:20.520 yourself on it and also if those tests 00:05:22.560 become more difficult and try to link it 00:05:24.680 into information and knowledge that you 00:05:26.319 already have how does this subject a 00:05:28.639 link with subject B what does it mean 00:05:30.280 for subject C ask yourself questions 00:05:32.440 about it from lots of different angles 00:05:34.680 spaced practice is when you have a gap 00:05:36.440 between study sessions so if you're 00:05:38.160 going to study something for I don't 00:05:39.520 know 5 hours instead of doing 5 hours in 00:05:41.880 one day you're better doing five hours 00:05:43.880 across five days you also get the added 00:05:46.080 bonus that when you come to the next 00:05:47.639 session you can use retrieval practice 00:05:49.840 to remember what you covered in the 00:05:51.440 first session method three is inter 00:05:53.400 leaving now that's where instead of 00:05:55.280 studying the same topic within a subject 00:05:57.720 in blocks you mix up the topics so for 00:06:01.120 an example if you were studying physics 00:06:03.639 and you were doing Newton's laws of 00:06:05.479 motion instead of answering lots and 00:06:07.599 lots and lots of questions on Newton's 00:06:09.319 Laws of Motion it's more effective to 00:06:11.680

00:00:00.440 this book could change your life I know 00:00:02.480 that sounds like clickbait but it's true 00:00:04.640 this book teaches you how to learn and 00:00:06.359 that is such a fundamentally important 00:00:08.200 skill to excel at anything you have to 00:00:10.120 be able to learn but for some reason 00:00:11.880 it's a skill that's rarely taught and I 00:00:14.280 don't really understand why I'm going to 00:00:16.000 share this book with you I'm going to 00:00:17.439 give you a brief summary of what it 00:00:18.600 contains and tell you what I like about 00:00:21.039 it and what I don't like so much and 00:00:23.439 then you can decide whether or not it's 00:00:24.640 the right book for you I'll also give 00:00:26.480 you three learning techniques from the 00:00:28.160 book which will definitely improve your 00:00:30.439 learning and the other thing that I want 00:00:32.279 to do is compare this book with this 00:00:35.559 book which if you watch the channel 00:00:37.280 regularly you will have seen me talk 00:00:38.840 about this is a great book on learning 00:00:40.920 and I still like this book very much but 00:00:42.879 how does it compare to this one well 00:00:44.920 keep watching to find out you know when 00:00:47.559 you cram for a test and then shortly 00:00:49.079 afterwards forget everything that you've 00:00:50.680 learned and don't tell me that you've 00:00:52.600 never done that before uh chapter one is 00:00:55.000 all about that and it explains the 00:00:56.680 difference between working memory which 00:00:58.760 is if you know how Compu computers work 00:01:00.440 it's a bit like Ram it's the memory that 00:01:02.519 you use whilst you're thinking and it 00:01:04.199 Compares that to long-term memory and it 00:01:06.479 explains that to learn you have to move 00:01:09.080 information from your working memory to 00:01:10.880 your long-term memory and it discusses 00:01:12.640 ways of doing that it also talks about 00:01:14.400 how working memory can give the illusion 00:01:16.360 of learning and how it deceives you into 00:01:17.960 thinking that you've learned something 00:01:19.320 so you know when you're reading a 00:01:20.479 textbook and you go through it and you 00:01:22.200 think yeah yeah yeah I know how to do 00:01:23.520 that you go through the worked example 00:01:25.159 just quickly and you have a sense that 00:01:27.040 you understand it but then when you go 00:01:28.439 back to it perhaps the next day 00:01:30.520 you can't remember anything about it or 00:01:32.000 you don't know how to do it that's 00:01:33.360 because your working memory has fooled 00:01:34.720 you into thinking that you've learned it 00:01:35.960 when you haven't really so chapter one 00:01:37.960 sort of introduces that topic chapter 00:01:40.439 one talks about the limitations of 00:01:41.920 working memory and your working memory 00:01:43.840 is really quite limited and it uses the 00:01:45.960 analogy of an octopus with four 00:01:47.880 tentacles that can only hold four things 00:01:50.200 at once and it introduces methods that 00:01:52.600 you can use to move information from 00:01:54.759 your working memory to your long-term 00:01:56.399 memory chapter 2 goes into working 00:01:58.600 memory in a little bit more Det detail 00:02:00.439 and it discusses the effects that 00:02:02.200 working memory can have on your ability 00:02:04.079 to learn and it talks about two types of 00:02:06.320 people the race car driver who have 00:02:08.520 pretty good working memories and then 00:02:10.080 the hiker whose working memories aren't 00:02:12.480 quite so good and it's true that if you 00:02:14.319 don't have a great working memory then 00:02:16.160 you can find it more difficult to learn 00:02:19.040 that's the bad news but the good news is 00:02:21.000 that your long-term memory is pretty 00:02:22.840 much Limitless and if you don't have 00:02:25.440 such a good working memory you can use 00:02:27.160 strategies that will enable your 00:02:28.920 long-term memory to kick in so I think 00:02:31.480 this is one of the strengths of the book 00:02:32.879 because if you have a poor working 00:02:34.480 memory you can easily be written off as 00:02:36.760 someone that can't learn particularly 00:02:38.560 well but these methods will ensure that 00:02:40.519 you can learn as well or in some cases 00:02:43.360 even better than people who have really 00:02:45.800 good working memories chapter 3 explains 00:02:47.760 how your brain works obviously not 00:02:50.040 completely but what it does do is tell 00:02:51.680 you how information goes from the 00:02:53.000 working memory to the long-term memory 00:02:55.440 and that's in the neocortex and what 00:02:57.440 role the hippocampus plays in that I 00:02:59.519 didn't know much about these processes 00:03:01.080 so it was useful to me it also has some 00:03:03.360 practical use because it makes you more 00:03:05.080 aware of things like why sleep is 00:03:07.400 important when it comes to transferring 00:03:09.480 information from your working memory to 00:03:11.159 your long-term memory chapter four 00:03:12.760 discusses a really important topic 00:03:15.000 procrastination how to avoid it and how 00:03:17.360 to overcome it it also talks about the 00:03:19.400 brain's two methods of concentration 00:03:21.360 focused and diffuse and how 00:03:23.640 understanding those can help you to 00:03:25.200 optimize your own learning essentially 00:03:27.200 you work in Focus mode until you become 00:03:28.840 frustrated with something you can't do 00:03:30.319 anymore and then you rest so that your 00:03:32.080 brain can make sense of what's going on 00:03:33.760 the book also discusses two learning 00:03:35.319 Pathways the declarative pathway and the 00:03:37.360 procedural pathway declarative is when 00:03:39.959 you intentionally learn something like I 00:03:41.879 don't know studying Latin vocab and the 00:03:44.239 procedural pathway is when you learn how 00:03:46.799 to ride a bike usually you can explain 00:03:49.080 the declarative process but you can't 00:03:51.200 explain the procedural one and to learn 00:03:53.200 something well you need to use both 00:03:54.760 Pathways what did I like about the book 00:03:57.159 definitely the information that it 00:03:58.439 contains it's all based based on 00:04:00.000 scientific evidence and it's explained 00:04:01.720 in a very accessible style was there 00:04:03.519 anything that I didn't like sometimes 00:04:05.640 that accessible style moves a little bit 00:04:08.040 too close I think to being simplistic 00:04:11.239 but that only happens every now and then 00:04:12.840 and I do understand that they're aiming 00:04:14.360 this book at a very wide market so if 00:04:16.759 you own this book make it stick is it 00:04:18.798 worth getting this one there's quite a 00:04:21.160 lot of overlap between these two books 00:04:23.040 this book's far more recent it was 00:04:24.560 published a couple of years ago and this 00:04:26.960 one is getting on for 10 years old now 00:04:29.400 but they're both based on science this 00:04:32.199 one goes more into how the brain works 00:04:36.400 but they cover a lot of the same ground 00:04:38.520 if you're just looking for practical 00:04:39.639 learning techniques then you only need 00:04:41.400 one or the other but if you're 00:04:42.880 interested in learning in general then 00:04:44.840 you know you might as well get them both 00:04:46.280 this book does cover ground that this 00:04:47.880 one doesn't so here are some learning 00:04:49.639 techniques from the book that you can 00:04:50.919 use today number one retrieval practice 00:04:53.600 this is the most effective learning 00:04:55.039 technique known to science we learn more 00:04:57.240 when we attempt to retrieve information 00:04:58.840 from our brains so if you want to learn 00:05:01.039 something test yourself just keep 00:05:03.440 testing yourself and when I've mentioned 00:05:04.880 this in the past in other videos I've 00:05:06.919 had people in the comments saying oh but 00:05:08.400 that's just rot learning it's not 00:05:11.039 retrieval practice I.E testing yourself 00:05:13.840 improves memory and understanding you 00:05:16.720 will understand a topic better and 00:05:18.479 remember more about it if you test 00:05:20.520 yourself on it and also if those tests 00:05:22.560 become more difficult and try to link it 00:05:24.680 into information and knowledge that you 00:05:26.319 already have how does this subject a 00:05:28.639 link with subject B what does it mean 00:05:30.280 for subject C ask yourself questions 00:05:32.440 about it from lots of different angles 00:05:34.680 spaced practice is when you have a gap 00:05:36.440 between study sessions so if you're 00:05:38.160 going to study something for I don't 00:05:39.520 know 5 hours instead of doing 5 hours in 00:05:41.880 one day you're better doing five hours 00:05:43.880 across five days you also get the added 00:05:46.080 bonus that when you come to the next 00:05:47.639 session you can use retrieval practice 00:05:49.840 to remember what you covered in the 00:05:51.440 first session method three is inter 00:05:53.400 leaving now that's where instead of 00:05:55.280 studying the same topic within a subject 00:05:57.720 in blocks you mix up the topics so for 00:06:01.120 an example if you were studying physics 00:06:03.639 and you were doing Newton's laws of 00:06:05.479 motion instead of answering lots and 00:06:07.599 lots and lots of questions on Newton's 00:06:09.319 Laws of Motion it's more effective to 00:06:11.680 mix it up with say Newton's Laws of 00:06:14.080 gravitation and perhaps circular motion 00:06:16.960 and the reason is this if you're just 00:06:18.840 doing a lot of questions on Laws of 00:06:20.840 Motion you don't have to think deeply 00:06:23.039 about how you answer that particular 00:06:25.080 question because you know it's a Laws of 00:06:27.000 Motion question whereas if you mix it up 00:06:29.520 up you have to recognize which method 00:06:32.240 that you need to use because you have to 00:06:33.919 first categorize that problem and that 00:06:36.479 categorizing of the problem helps you to 00:06:38.599 see the nuances and the differences and 00:06:40.919 similarities between different topics 00:06:43.240 within a subject so interleaving is a 00:06:45.639 very effective method and it's been 00:06:47.120 shown by lots of research to be far more 00:06:49.759 effective than just doing lots of one 00:06:52.039 thing and then lots of another thing and 00:06:53.919 it's not just in physics it's been shown 00:06:55.440 to be effective in lots of different 00:06:57.000 subjects as well two other bits of 00:06:58.639 advice EX exercise helps learning and so 00:07:01.240 does sleep a lot of the topics I talk 00:07:04.039 about in this video are difficult to 00:07:06.080 learn but there's a free and easy way to 00:07:09.000 help you grasp them brilliant.org the 00:07:11.840 sponsor of this video brilliant is the 00:07:14.120 best way to learn math data science and 00:07:16.240 computer science interactively because 00:07:18.360 learning isn't a passive process if you 00:07:20.560 want to master a subject you have to 00:07:22.440 engage with it you have to think about 00:07:24.199 it from different perspectives and 00:07:25.960 challenge your understanding of it and 00:07:27.879 that's how you learn with brilliant it 00:07:29.440 helps you to hack the learning process 00:07:31.199 by giving you fun interactive challenges

chapter four 00:03:12.760 discusses a really important topic 00:03:15.000 procrastination how to avoid it and how 00:03:17.360 to overcome it it also talks about the 00:03:19.400 brain's two methods of concentration 00:03:21.360 focused and diffuse and how 00:03:23.640 understanding those can help you to 00:03:25.200 optimize your own learning essentially 00:03:27.200 you work in Focus mode until you become 00:03:28.840 frustrated with something you can't do 00:03:30.319 anymore and then you rest so that your 00:03:32.080 brain can make sense of what's going on 00:03:33.760 the book also discusses two learning 00:03:35.319 Pathways the declarative pathway and the 00:03:37.360 procedural pathway declarative is when 00:03:39.959 you intentionally learn something like I 00:03:41.879 don't know studying Latin vocab and the 00:03:44.239 procedural pathway is when you learn how 00:03:46.799 to ride a bike usually you can explain 00:03:49.080 the declarative process but you can't 00:03:51.200 explain the procedural one and to learn 00:03:53.200 something well you need to use both 00:03:54.760 Pathways what did I like about the book 00:03:57.159 definitely the information that it 00:03:58.439 contains it's all based based on 00:04:00.000 scientific evidence and it's explained 00:04:01.720 in a very accessible style was there 00:04:03.519 anything that I didn't like sometimes 00:04:05.640 that accessible style moves a little bit 00:04:08.040 too close I think to being simplistic 00:04:11.239 but that only happens every now and then 00:04:12.840 and I do understand that they're aiming 00:04:14.360 this book at a very wide market so if 00:04:16.759 you own this book make it stick is it 00:04:18.798 worth getting this one there's quite a 00:04:21.160 lot of overlap between these two books 00:04:23.040 this book's far more recent it was 00:04:24.560 published a couple of years ago and this 00:04:26.960 one is getting on for 10 years old now 00:04:29.400 but they're both based on science this 00:04:32.199 one goes more into how the brain works 00:04:36.400 but they cover a lot of the same ground 00:04:38.520 if you're just looking for practical 00:04:39.639 learning techniques then you only need 00:04:41.400 one or the other but if you're 00:04:42.880 interested in learning in general then 00:04:44.840 you know you might as well get them both 00:04:46.280 this book does cover ground that this 00:04:47.880 one doesn't so here are some learning 00:04:49.639 techniques from the book that you can 00:04:50.919 use today number one retrieval practice 00:04:53.600 this is the most effective learning 00:04:55.039 technique known to science we learn more 00:04:57.240 when we attempt to retrieve information 00:04:58.840 from our brains so if you want to learn 00:05:01.039 something test yourself just keep 00:05:03.440 testing yourself and when I've mentioned 00:05:04.880 this in the past in other videos I've 00:05:06.919 had people in the comments saying oh but 00:05:08.400 that's just rot learning it's not 00:05:11.039 retrieval practice I.E testing yourself 00:05:13.840 improves memory and understanding you 00:05:16.720 will understand a topic better and 00:05:18.479 remember more about it if you test 00:05:20.520 yourself on it and also if those tests 00:05:22.560 become more difficult and try to link it 00:05:24.680 into information and knowledge that you 00:05:26.319 already have how does this subject a 00:05:28.639 link with subject B what does it mean 00:05:30.280 for subject C ask yourself questions 00:05:32.440 about it from lots of different angles 00:05:34.680 spaced practice is when you have a gap 00:05:36.440 between study sessions so if you're 00:05:38.160 going to study something for I don't 00:05:39.520 know 5 hours instead of doing 5 hours in 00:05:41.880 one day you're better doing five hours 00:05:43.880 across five days you also get the added 00:05:46.080 bonus that when you come to the next 00:05:47.639 session you can use retrieval practice 00:05:49.840 to remember what you covered in the 00:05:51.440 first session method three is inter 00:05:53.400 leaving now that's where instead of 00:05:55.280 studying the same topic within a subject 00:05:57.720 in blocks you mix up the topics so for 00:06:01.120 an example if you were studying physics 00:06:03.639 and you were doing Newton's laws of 00:06:05.479 motion instead of answering lots and 00:06:07.599 lots and lots of questions on Newton's 00:06:09.319 Laws of Motion it's more effective to 00:06:11.680 mix it up with say Newton's Laws of 00:06:14.080 gravitation and perhaps circular motion 00:06:16.960 and the reason is this if you're just 00:06:18.840 doing a lot of questions on Laws of 00:06:20.840 Motion you don't have to think deeply 00:06:23.039 about how you answer that particular 00:06:25.080 question because you know it's a Laws of 00:06:27.000 Motion question whereas if you mix it up 00:06:29.520 up you have to recognize which method 00:06:32.240 that you need to use because you have to 00:06:33.919 first categorize that problem and that 00:06:36.479 categorizing of the problem helps you to 00:06:38.599 see the nuances and the differences and 00:06:40.919 similarities between different topics 00:06:43.240 within a subject so interleaving is a 00:06:45.639 very effective method and it's been 00:06:47.120 shown by lots of research to be far more 00:06:49.759 effective than just doing lots of one 00:06:52.039 thing and then lots of another thing and 00:06:53.919 it's not just in physics it's been shown 00:06:55.440 to be effective in lots of different 00:06:57.000 subjects as well two other bits of 00:06:58.639 advice EX exercise helps learning and so 00:07:01.240 does sleep a lot of the topics I talk 00:07:04.039 about in this video are difficult to 00:07:06.080 learn but there's a free and easy way to 00:07:09.000 help you grasp them

00:00:00.440 this book could change your life I know 00:00:02.480 that sounds like clickbait but it's true 00:00:04.640 this book teaches you how to learn and 00:00:06.359 that is such a fundamentally important 00:00:08.200 skill to excel at anything you have to 00:00:10.120 be able to learn but for some reason 00:00:11.880 it's a skill that's rarely taught and I 00:00:14.280 don't really understand why I'm going to 00:00:16.000 share this book with you I'm going to 00:00:17.439 give you a brief summary of what it 00:00:18.600 contains and tell you what I like about 00:00:21.039 it and what I don't like so much and 00:00:23.439 then you can decide whether or not it's 00:00:24.640 the right book for you I'll also give 00:00:26.480 you three learning techniques from the 00:00:28.160 book which will definitely improve your 00:00:30.439 learning and the other thing that I want 00:00:32.279 to do is compare this book with this 00:00:35.559 book which if you watch the channel 00:00:37.280 regularly you will have seen me talk 00:00:38.840 about this is a great book on learning 00:00:40.920 and I still like this book very much but 00:00:42.879 how does it compare to this one well 00:00:44.920 keep watching to find out you know when 00:00:47.559 you cram for a test and then shortly 00:00:49.079 afterwards forget everything that you've 00:00:50.680 learned and don't tell me that you've 00:00:52.600 never done that before uh chapter one is 00:00:55.000 all about that and it explains the 00:00:56.680 difference between working memory which 00:00:58.760 is if you know how Compu computers work 00:01:00.440 it's a bit like Ram it's the memory that 00:01:02.519 you use whilst you're thinking and it 00:01:04.199 Compares that to long-term memory and it 00:01:06.479 explains that to learn you have to move 00:01:09.080 information from your working memory to 00:01:10.880 your long-term memory and it discusses 00:01:12.640 ways of doing that it also talks about 00:01:14.400 how working memory can give the illusion 00:01:16.360 of learning and how it deceives you into 00:01:17.960 thinking that you've learned something 00:01:19.320 so you know when you're reading a 00:01:20.479 textbook and you go through it and you 00:01:22.200 think yeah yeah yeah I know how to do 00:01:23.520 that you go through the worked example 00:01:25.159 just quickly and you have a sense that 00:01:27.040 you understand it but then when you go 00:01:28.439 back to it perhaps the next day 00:01:30.520 you can't remember anything about it or 00:01:32.000 you don't know how to do it that's 00:01:33.360 because your working memory has fooled 00:01:34.720 you into thinking that you've learned it 00:01:35.960 when you haven't really so chapter one 00:01:37.960 sort of introduces that topic chapter 00:01:40.439 one talks about the limitations of 00:01:41.920 working memory and your working memory 00:01:43.840 is really quite limited and it uses the 00:01:45.960 analogy of an octopus with four 00:01:47.880 tentacles that can only hold four things 00:01:50.200 at once and it introduces methods that 00:01:52.600 you can use to move information from 00:01:54.759 your working memory to your long-term 00:01:56.399 memory chapter 2 goes into working 00:01:58.600 memory in a little bit more Det detail 00:02:00.439 and it discusses the effects that 00:02:02.200 working memory can have on your ability 00:02:04.079 to learn and it talks about two types of 00:02:06.320 people the race car driver who have 00:02:08.520 pretty good working memories and then 00:02:10.080 the hiker whose working memories aren't 00:02:12.480 quite so good and it's true that if you 00:02:14.319 don't have a great working memory then 00:02:16.160 you can find it more difficult to learn 00:02:19.040 that's the bad news but the good news is 00:02:21.000 that your long-term memory is pretty 00:02:22.840 much Limitless and if you don't have 00:02:25.440 such a good working memory you can use 00:02:27.160 strategies that will enable your 00:02:28.920 long-term memory to kick in so I think 00:02:31.480 this is one of the strengths of the book 00:02:32.879 because if you have a poor working 00:02:34.480 memory you can easily be written off as 00:02:36.760 someone that can't learn particularly 00:02:38.560 well but these methods will ensure that 00:02:40.519 you can learn as well or in some cases 00:02:43.360 even better than people who have really 00:02:45.800 good working memories chapter 3 explains 00:02:47.760 how your brain works obviously not 00:02:50.040 completely but what it does do is tell 00:02:51.680 you how information goes from the 00:02:53.000 working memory to the long-term memory 00:02:55.440 and that's in the neocortex and what 00:02:57.440 role the hippocampus plays in that I 00:02:59.519 didn't know much about these processes 00:03:01.080 so it was useful to me it also has some 00:03:03.360 practical use because it makes you more 00:03:05.080 aware of things like why sleep is 00:03:07.400 important when it comes to transferring 00:03:09.480 information from your working memory to 00:03:11.159 your long-term memory chapter four 00:03:12.760 discusses a really important topic 00:03:15.000 procrastination how to avoid it and how 00:03:17.360 to overcome it it also talks about the 00:03:19.400 brain's two methods of concentration 00:03:21.360 focused and diffuse and how 00:03:23.640 understanding those can help you to 00:03:25.200 optimize your own learning essentially 00:03:27.200 you work in Focus mode until you become 00:03:28.840 frustrated with something you can't do 00:03:30.319 anymore and then you rest so that your 00:03:32.080 brain can make sense of what's going on 00:03:33.760 the book also discusses two learning 00:03:35.319 Pathways the declarative pathway and the 00:03:37.360 procedural pathway declarative is when 00:03:39.959 you intentionally learn something like I 00:03:41.879

00:03:51.200 explain the procedural one and to learn 00:03:53.200 something well you need to use both 00:03:54.760 Pathways what did I like about the book 00:03:57.159 definitely the information that

you come to the next 00:05:47.639 session you can use retrieval practice 00:05:49.840 to remember what you covered in the 00:05:51.440 first session method three is inter 00:05:53.400 leaving now that's where instead of 00:05:55.280 studying the same topic within a subject 00:05:57.720 in blocks you mix up the topics so for 00:06:01.120 an example if you were studying physics 00:06:03.639 and
